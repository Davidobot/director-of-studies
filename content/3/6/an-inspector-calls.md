# An Inspector Calls (GCSE English Literature AQA)

## Plot overview
An Inspector Calls is a play by J.B. Priestley, written in 1945 but set in 1912. The Birling family — Arthur, Sybil, Sheila, Eric — and Gerald Croft are celebrating Sheila and Gerald's engagement when Inspector Goole arrives to investigate the death of Eva Smith, a young working-class woman who has taken her own life. Through interrogation, the Inspector reveals each character's role in Eva's destruction. At the end, the Inspector leaves, Sheila and Eric remain shaken, but Arthur, Sybil, and Gerald revert to denial when it seems no real inspector exists and no girl has died — until the final phone call reveals that a girl has indeed died and a real inspector is on his way.

## Social responsibility and collective guilt
The play's central argument is that society is interconnected and individuals bear responsibility for the consequences of their actions on others. Priestley uses Eva Smith as a symbol of the working class exploited by capitalism. Each Birling has contributed to Eva's destruction — sacking her, blacklisting her, refusing her charity, getting her pregnant, abandoning her. The Inspector's famous final speech articulates the play's moral: "We are members of one body. We are responsible for each other."

## Class and social inequality
Written in 1945, the play reflects socialist ideas prominent after the Second World War. Priestley contrasts the comfortable, self-satisfied Birlings with Eva Smith's precarious existence. Arthur Birling represents the self-made capitalist who prioritises profit over welfare: he sacked Eva for leading a strike for better wages. Sybil Birling uses her position on the charitable committee to deny help to a desperate woman. The play indicts the complacency and hypocrisy of the upper-middle class.

## The Inspector and dramatic function
Inspector Goole functions simultaneously as a detective, a moral judge, and possibly a spiritual/supernatural figure. His name (Goole / ghoul) hints at other-worldly status. He arrives with near-omniscient knowledge and systematically dismantles the family's comfortable self-image. He controls the structure of the investigation, refusing to allow evasion. Whether he is a real inspector, the future, or a conscience made flesh, he embodies Priestley's moral and political message. His function is didactic — to teach the audience as much as the characters.

## Generational divide
Sheila and Eric represent the possibility of change. Both accept responsibility and are genuinely shaken. Sheila's growing awareness and refusal to revert to ignorance — "I know I'm to blame — and I'm ashamed of it" — offers a model of moral development. Gerald, Arthur, and Sybil reassert social conformity and self-preservation once the immediate threat seems removed. Priestley distinguishes between those capable of growth and those trapped in class and self-interest.

## Time, dramatic irony, and dramatic structure
The play is set in 1912, two years before the First World War and during the height of Edwardian complacency. Priestley's 1945 audience would have known what the Birlings could not: that the Titanic would sink, that war was coming, that the world Arthur Birling celebrates — "a time of steadily increasing prosperity" — was about to end. Arthur's pompous speeches about no war and no Labour government drip with dramatic irony. The unities of time, place, and action create claustrophobic intensity.

## Gender
Eva Smith has no voice in the play — she is defined through others' accounts — which itself reflects her social powerlessness. Women in 1912 had limited legal and economic rights; Priestley highlights how powerless working-class women were against men of power. Sheila's development challenges passive femininity; Sybil's rigidity shows how women could also perpetuate class structures.

## Key themes: responsibility, guilt, and change
The play poses the question: can people change? Priestley wrote it in 1945 with the belief that the post-war world offered the chance to build a more equal, responsible society — the Welfare State was being established. The Inspector's warning — that if people do not learn responsibility willingly, they will be taught by "fire and blood and anguish" — is a direct address to Priestley's audience.

## Language and structure
Priestley uses a naturalistic domestic setting to wrong-foot the audience: the cosy dinner party is disrupted by the Inspector's arrival. Stage directions are unusually detailed and purposeful. The lighting shift from "pink and intimate" to "brighter and harder" signals the move from illusion to reality. The Inspector's language is direct, without the social niceties the Birlings use; his speeches build in scale and rhetoric towards the final prophecy.

## Context
Priestley was a socialist and saw the 1945 election as a mandate for social reform. The play was written just before the Attlee government, the NHS, and the welfare state. Setting the play in 1912 allows Priestley to comment on pre-war capitalist values through a post-war lens. The Birlings represent attitudes Priestley wanted the audience to reject.

## Exam technique
AQA GCSE rewards analysis of specific word choices and dramatic techniques — don't just identify a quotation, explore its layers. For Inspector Goole, consider his symbolic as well as literal function. For character questions, trace change (or resistance to change) through the play. Context must be woven into analysis, not added as a separate paragraph. Avoid judging characters in isolation — consider their social class and time.
