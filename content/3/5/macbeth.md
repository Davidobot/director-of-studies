# Macbeth (GCSE English Literature AQA)

## Plot overview
Macbeth is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, written around 1606. Macbeth, a brave Scottish general, receives a prophecy from three witches that he will become King of Scotland. Encouraged by his wife, Lady Macbeth, he murders King Duncan and takes the throne. Paranoia drives him to further murders — Banquo and the family of Macduff — but guilt and disorder grow. Lady Macbeth is consumed by guilt and takes her own life. Macbeth is finally killed by Macduff at the battle of Dunsinane, and Malcolm is restored as rightful king.

## Ambition and the corrupting influence of power
Ambition is the play's central theme. Macbeth's ambition is initially dormant — he is a loyal soldier — but is catalysed by the witches' prophecy and Lady Macbeth's pressure. Shakespeare shows ambition as a force that overrides moral judgment: Macbeth acknowledges he has "no spur / To prick the sides of my intent, but only / Vaulting ambition." Once power is obtained, it must be maintained through increasing violence, illustrating how unchecked ambition corrupts absolutely.

## Kingship and tyranny
The play contrasts legitimate kingship (Duncan, Malcolm) with tyranny (Macbeth). Duncan embodies the ideal of a natural king — generous, trusted, divinely ordained. Macbeth's rule is characterised by fear, murder, and disorder. Edward the Confessor is held up as the opposite of Macbeth: a king who heals disease. Shakespeare uses the concept of the Divine Right of Kings — the belief that monarchs were appointed by God — making regicide both a political crime and a spiritual one.

## The supernatural
The witches (the Weird Sisters) represent fate, temptation, and the uncanny. Their prophecies are ambiguous — true in literal terms but misleading. The supernatural also manifests in Banquo's ghost, the dagger hallucination, and Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking. Shakespeare's Jacobean audience would have taken witchcraft seriously; King James I wrote a book on the subject (Daemonologie). The supernatural blurs free will and fate: are the Macbeths victims of prophecy or architects of their own destruction?

## Lady Macbeth
Lady Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's most complex female characters. She initially appears more ruthless than Macbeth, calling on spirits to "unsex" her and suppress her conscience. She drives the murder plan and steadies Macbeth's resolve. But as the play progresses she becomes isolated, guilt-ridden, and ultimately unable to cope with what they have done. Her sleepwalking scene — "Out, damned spot" — reverses her earlier strength and shows the psychological toll of evil. Her arc challenges and ultimately confirms ideas about gender and guilt.

## Masculinity and gender
The play interrogates what it means to be a man. Lady Macbeth questions Macbeth's manhood to shame him into murder; Macbeth frames his violence as masculine courage. Yet true manhood in the play is associated not with violence but with righteous action, grief, and justice. Macduff's grief at the loss of his family is presented as both human and legitimate, distinct from Macbeth's hollow aggression.

## Guilt, conscience, and psychological deterioration
Guilt is inescapable from the moment of Duncan's murder. Macbeth hears voices, sees daggers and ghosts; his sleep is destroyed ("Macbeth doth murder sleep"). Lady Macbeth's deterioration is equally vivid. Shakespeare presents conscience as an internal force that tyranny cannot suppress — ultimately more powerful than political authority. This theme would have resonated with an audience who believed in divine justice.

## Language and structure
Key techniques include soliloquy (giving the audience direct access to characters' thoughts), imagery of blood (guilt and violence), darkness (concealment and evil), clothing (Macbeth wearing a king's borrowed robes), and nature disrupted (the unnatural following Duncan's murder). The play's brevity and pace — short scenes, rapid reversals — create suffocating dramatic tension.

## Context
Written in 1606, Macbeth responds to the Gunpowder Plot (1605) and the accession of James I. James was interested in witchcraft and traced his lineage to Banquo — flattery encoded in the play. The Divine Right of Kings was a live political concept. The play's exploration of usurpation and legitimate rule spoke directly to anxieties about political stability.

## Exam technique
AQA GCSE requires close reference to language, structure, and context for high marks. For character questions, trace development across the play rather than listing traits. For theme questions, consider how ideas shift and complicate. Always embed short, precise quotations and analyse specific word choices. Consider how an audience — contemporary or modern — might respond. Avoid retelling plot.
