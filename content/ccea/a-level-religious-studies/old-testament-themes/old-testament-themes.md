# Old Testament Themes (A-level Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Introduction and approach to the Old Testament
The Old Testament for A-level study is not a single, uniform book but a collection of texts composed, edited and reworked over centuries. Students should approach these texts first as literature produced in particular historical and social contexts and second as religious writings that have been used to shape identity and ethics. Many of the narratives and prophetic materials were written or redacted with theological and political concerns in mind: they offer theology through story, law, poetry and oracular speech. Throughout your study you should be able to distinguish between the historical background that gave rise to the text, the literary form and the theological message. Being precise about the kind of passage you are discussing — covenant text, narrative, lament, oracle, prophetic speech — helps in explaining what the author intended and how original audiences might have heard the words.

## Covenant and election: meaning and implications
Covenant and election are foundational concepts. A covenant in the Hebrew Bible is a binding agreement between God and people which sets out expectations and promises. The major covenantal moments — Noahic, Abrahamic and Mosaic — establish God’s commitment to creation, to a chosen family and to a people bound by law. These texts are theological as much as legal: they define identity. Election, the idea that Israel is chosen by God, can be presented as privilege, responsibility or both. The literature often shows tension between promise and failure: the people repeatedly fail to live up to covenantal obligations, and prophets and priests interpret those failures as moral, ritual or political lapses. The post-exilic texts explore how election functions when the people are dispersed or excluded, and later passages develop themes of inclusion as well as exclusivity, suggesting that the covenantal promises have wider implications beyond Israel’s borders.

When writing about covenant, students should do more than recount the clauses. Show how covenant functions as a theological frame for interpreting history and behaviour, explain the rhetorical devices such as courtroom imagery and covenant lawsuits, and assess the ways later editors used covenant language to explain exile, restoration and hope.

## David, kingship and the Davidic narratives
The David stories occupy a central place in the Old Testament’s reflection on monarchy, leadership and divine favour. The rise and reign of David is told through a mixture of heroic episodes, moral failures and political consolidation. These narratives were shaped by theological interests: the Davidic covenant promises an enduring line and thus a theological rationale for Davidic rule. At the same time other texts — including those in the Deuteronomistic history — critique kingship and expose human frailty.

In A-level essays you should address both the portrait and the purpose of these narratives. Discuss how different passages present David as chosen and favored, how later texts (for example wisdom and prophetic literature) re-evaluate his legacy, and how scholars debate the historicity of the narratives. The minimalist–maximalist discussion can be referenced to show awareness of contemporary scholarly debate: minimalists question how much of the narrative reflects historical fact, while maximalists accept more of the biblical account as rooted in historical memory. Whether one leans towards historical or literary readings, the key is to show how the Davidic material functions as political theology that justifies kingship and shapes subsequent religious expectations.

## Kingship and the prophetic challenge: Elijah and the prophetic movement
Kingship and prophecy are often set against one another in the Old Testament. Prophets do not merely predict the future; they interpret events, challenge rulers, and call the community back to covenantal fidelity. Elijah is the classic example of a prophet confronting royal power. His dramatic confrontations with Ahab and the contest on Mount Carmel present a theological polemic about where true power resides: with the God of Israel or with rival deities and imperial structures. The prophetic traditions use narrative and symbolic action to bring moral and theological critique into public life.

When analysing prophetic texts, pay attention to genre and technique. Prophetic speech can be denunciatory and symbolic, and prophets often use enacted parables, lament and legal metaphor. Explain how prophetic narratives challenge royal ideology and ask what kinds of authority these prophets claim. Remember also that later editors shaped prophetic traditions to address subsequent crises and to provide models of resistance, repentance and reform.

## Amos and social justice: election, responsibility and judgment
Amos offers one of the clearest ethical voices in the Hebrew prophets. Writing in a period of relative prosperity, Amos condemns structural injustice and religious hypocrisy. His rhetoric links divine election with moral responsibility: being chosen does not exempt a people from ethical conduct; rather, it increases accountability. Amos’s oracles against the nations and Israel make a point about universal standards of justice and divine judgment. The closing material of Amos, which includes words of restoration, shows how prophetic literature can combine harsh critique with a vision of hope.

In essays on Amos, focus on his use of imagery, the oracular structure, and the social and economic issues he attacks: exploitation, corrupt legal procedures and hollow ritual. Explain how Amos’s call to social justice has been read across history and how redactional layers at the end of the book offer theological reassurance that God’s judgment can be followed by restoration.

## The nature of God: compassionate and violent portrayals; Jeremiah and Ezekiel on exile and hope
A2 study deepens the picture of God in the Old Testament by asking why the same corpus contains both compassionate and violent images of the divine. Texts portray a God of mercy who yearns for justice, and also a divine warrior who orders or accepts violent judgement and the grim logic of herem (devoting things to destruction). These contrasting images arise from different historical situations and theological aims: some texts respond to threats and warfare with the language of divine support in battle; others emphasise God’s concern for the vulnerable and the demands of righteousness.

Jeremiah and Ezekiel are central to understanding the prophetic response to crisis. Jeremiah’s public proclamations reveal a stern indictment of institutional failure, temple complacency and social injustice, while his private laments provide a deeply personal voice of anguish and disorientation. His notion of a “new covenant” develops the idea that God will write the law on hearts, an inner transformation that addresses the failure of mere external conformity. Ezekiel, writing from exile, blends dramatic symbolic action with visionary hope. His oracles include fierce judgements alongside visionary scenes such as the Valley of Dry Bones and the restored Temple, teaching that God’s presence can move beyond the old cultic centre.

When answering exam questions on these prophets, link textual detail to the wider theme of leadership, exile and theological innovation. Explain the ways in which each prophet addresses community identity, the crisis of the Temple’s fall and the prospects of restoration. Show how literary features — call narratives, symbolic actions, laments and visions — communicate theological answers to the problem of suffering and national trauma.

## Leadership, text and alienation: interpretation and contemporary relevance
A persistent A-level theme is how religious texts and leadership shape identity, ethics and alienation. Old Testament texts function as authoritative sources for communities, but their authority is mediated by leaders — kings, priests and prophets — whose conduct is often under scrutiny in the texts themselves. The theme of alienation runs through many books: alienation from God, from self and from community emerges through sin, injustice and failure of leaders. Studying these passages invites reflection on the interpretive task: how do modern readers use ancient texts to respond to contemporary ethical questions? The Old Testament raises perennial issues such as social justice, the moral limits of power, the role of ritual, and the responsibility of leaders.

In coursework and exams you should move beyond descriptive accounts to evaluation. Consider the limits of literalist readings, address the historical distance between text and reader, and show how responsible interpretation involves attention to genre, context and the text’s rhetorical goals. A good answer will draw connections between biblical material and broader human experience, for example by showing how prophetic critique is relevant to discussions about political responsibility today.

## Exam technique
Exam answers should combine accurate knowledge with critical evaluation and clear communication. Begin by identifying exactly what the question asks and plan a short structure to ensure coherence: define key terms where necessary, select tightly focused textual examples and explain them rather than merely summarise. For AO1 tasks, present organised, detailed knowledge that shows understanding of historical context, literary form and theological purpose. For AO2 tasks, evaluate using balanced argument: consider strengths and weaknesses of different interpretations, refer to alternative readings where appropriate, and draw reasoned conclusions. Use textual references to support points but avoid long quotations; brief citations or paraphrase are more effective. In synoptic questions, explicitly make links between the set theme and at least one other unit or aspect of human experience, explaining relevance and consequences. Time management is crucial: allocate time to plan, write and check, and aim for clarity of expression with correct spelling and grammar. Finally, always aim to write a concluding paragraph that answers the question directly and summarises your judgment, showing the examiner you have addressed both knowledge and evaluation.
