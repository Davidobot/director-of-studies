# Acts of the Apostles (A-level Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview and purpose of Acts
The Acts of the Apostles is the narrative bridge between the life of Jesus as reported in the Gospels and the establishment of the early Christian movement across the Mediterranean world. Traditionally attributed to Luke, Acts is best understood as the second half of a two-volume work (Luke–Acts) addressed to a figure named Theophilus. Its stated purpose is to provide an ordered account of “the events that have been fulfilled among us” and to trace how the message of Jesus moved from a Jewish, Jerusalem-based community into the wider Gentile world. Acts combines theological interpretation with historical reportage: it presents the spread of the Gospel as part of God’s saving plan, enacted primarily through the gift and power of the Holy Spirit. The narrative is shaped by apologetic aims – to explain and justify the Christian mission to a diverse audience – while also functioning as a theological history that highlights continuity with scripture, the role of apostolic leadership, and the legitimacy of the Church’s mission.

## Structure and major episodes
Acts follows a clear geographical and theological progression often summarised as “Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8). The opening scenes establish the church’s beginnings in Jerusalem: the Ascension of Jesus, the appointment of Matthias, and the Pentecost event (Acts 1–2). Pentecost introduces the Holy Spirit in dramatic terms (Acts 2:1–41) and is immediately followed by a sketch of communal life characterised by teaching, fellowship, shared possessions and worship (Acts 2:42–47). The narrative then records internal challenges and the organisation of the community, such as the selection of the seven deacons (Acts 6) and the Ananias and Sapphira episode (Acts 5), which underline the demands of discipline and unity.

From Jerusalem the story moves outward. The martyrdom of Stephen (Acts 6–7) acts as a catalyst for dispersion; Philip’s evangelism in Samaria and his encounter with the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8) extends witness beyond Jewish boundaries. A crucial turning point is Peter’s vision and the conversion of Cornelius (Acts 10), which forces the Jerusalem church to confront whether Gentiles can be included without adopting full Jewish observance. The Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15) codifies a compromise and marks the Church’s official move toward a mission that embraces Gentiles.

The second half of Acts is dominated by Paul’s conversion and missionary activity. Paul’s dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus (Acts 9) and his subsequent three missionary journeys form the backbone of the narrative in Acts 13–28. These journeys, with episodes such as the speech at Pisidian Antioch (Acts 13), the Areopagus address at Athens (Acts 17), the Philippian jail episode (Acts 16), and the shipwreck on the way to Rome (Acts 27–28), are designed to show both the practical difficulties of mission and its inexorable advance toward Rome, the imperial centre. Acts concludes with Paul under house arrest in Rome, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 28:30–31).

## Key characters and their roles
While Acts is full of named individuals, certain figures carry particular theological and narrative weight. Peter functions as the apostolic leader in the Jerusalem phase, acting as preacher, miracle-worker and interpreter of God’s will (for example in his speech at Pentecost and in the Cornelius episode). Stephen and Philip represent transitional agents: Stephen’s role as a Hellenist figure and his long speech before the Sanhedrin make a theological critique of Israel’s history, while his martyrdom propels missionary expansion. Philip models evangelistic adaptability by preaching in Samaria and baptising the Ethiopian eunuch, showing that the gospel crosses ethnoreligious boundaries.

Paul emerges as the principal missionary and theologian for the Gentile mission. His conversion reshapes his identity from persecutor to apostle and frames much of Acts’ theology of repentance, calling and witness. Acts highlights Paul’s roles as itinerant preacher, founder of congregations, apologist before civic authorities, and interpreter of the Gospel for non-Jewish audiences. The varying speeches given by Peter and Paul are used by Luke to present developing theological emphases: Peter’s ministry stresses continuity with Israel and the place of the Spirit; Paul’s addresses emphasise God’s promise, the resurrection, and the call to repentance for all peoples.

## Theology and major themes
Acts is theological history: its dominant theological theme is the activity of the Holy Spirit as the engine of mission and transformation. The Spirit empowers preaching, enables miraculous signs, guides decisions (for example, the commissioning of missionaries), and breaks down barriers between Jew and Gentile. Closely linked with pneumatology is the theme of mission and witness (martyria): the apostles are witnesses to the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, called to take that testimony beyond the Jewish sphere.

Inclusion and the redefinition of the people of God are central themes. Acts wrestles with questions about the place of Gentiles, Jewish law, and the identity markers of the Christian community. The Cornelius episode and the Council of Jerusalem exemplify how early Christians negotiated these issues. Ecclesiology—what the church is and how it should be organised—appears repeatedly through descriptions of communal life, the selection of leaders, and the ministry of teaching and sacrament. Miracles and healings function as signs that validate the message and attract converts, yet Acts also encourages theological reflection about the nature and purpose of such signs. Finally, Acts frames the church’s story within a narrative of salvation history: the events unfold as a fulfilment of God’s promises and scriptures, underlining continuity with Israel even as the community expands.

## Historical reliability and scholarly debates
Scholars debate numerous historical and literary aspects of Acts. The traditional attribution to Luke, a physician and companion of Paul, is supported by the “we” passages (Acts 16:10–17; 20:5–15; 21:1–18; 27:1–28:16), which some read as evidence of the author’s presence on certain travels. Others argue the “we” sections may be a stylistic device or draw on travel diaries. Dating ranges from the early second century down to the late first century, with many favouring a date in the 80s–90s CE, though earlier dates are also defended. Questions about historical accuracy arise when Acts’ account is compared with Paul’s own letters: there are differences in chronology, emphasis and detail between Acts and Pauline epistles that have led to debates about Luke’s theological shaping of events. Historiographical genre is another point of discussion; Acts is not pure modern history but a theological narrative shaped to argue for a particular interpretation of events. Teaching and assessment require that students be able to describe Acts’ historical claims while evaluating the theological aims and recognising both the strengths and limitations of using Acts as a source for first-century Christianity.

## Acts and other aspects of human experience
Acts connects vividly with wider cultural and social questions. Its portrait of communal life—sharing possessions, worshipping together and caring for the marginalised (Acts 2:42–47; 4:32–35)—raises enduring ethical questions about wealth, community and social responsibility. The themes of persecution, witness and apologetics in Acts resonate with modern discussions about religious freedom and the costs of dissent. The way Luke presents miracles and charismatic phenomena has particular relevance for the study of modern charismatic and Pentecostal movements, which often draw on Acts as a theological and liturgical model. Acts also prompts reflection on evangelism in a multi-religious and multicultural world: its episodes show different missionary strategies, forms of dialogue and cultural negotiation that remain instructive for thinking about mission ethics today. Finally, the debate about the historical credibility of miracle stories invites students to weigh supernatural claims against historical-critical methods, the sociology of religion and contemporary approaches to testimony and evidence.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Acts, start by demonstrating clear, precise knowledge of the text: situate the passage or theme within Acts’ overall structure, and reference specific episodes or verses (for example Pentecost in Acts 2, Cornelius in Acts 10, the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, or Paul’s speech at Athens in Acts 17). For AO1 answers, show awareness of authorship, purpose and context, and explain key theological points such as the role of the Holy Spirit, the movement from Jewish to Gentile mission, and the development of ecclesial structures.

For AO2 and evaluative parts, balance description with critical analysis. Evaluate historical reliability by noting scholarly debates about dating, the “we” passages and discrepancies with Pauline letters, and assess Luke’s theological interests and apologetic aims. In synoptic or Section B style questions, make explicit links between Acts and at least one other unit of study (for example Luke’s Gospel, Paul’s letters, or early Christian writers) and to ‘other aspects of human experience’ such as modern missionary practice, charismatic Christianity, or issues around religious pluralism. Use a mix of textual evidence, reasoned argument and, where appropriate, brief reference to scholarly perspectives to support your view.

Structure each essay clearly: an introduction that defines terms and outlines your approach; a main body that alternates focused textual explanation with evaluative comment; and a conclusion that directly answers the question and summarizes your judgement. Time management is crucial: allocate time to planning, writing and checking quality of written communication including clarity, grammar and the correct use of technical vocabulary. When quoting or paraphrasing scripture in the exam remember that published questions use the Revised Standard Version, but always ensure any quotation supports your argument rather than substitutes for analysis. Aim for a balanced response that shows both confident knowledge of Acts and thoughtful critical engagement with its historical and theological complexities.
