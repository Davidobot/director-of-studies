# Philosophy of Religion: Existence & Theodicy (A-level Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Introduction
Philosophy of religion investigates the rational foundations and implications of religious belief. At A-level this topic brings together classic arguments for God’s existence, the problem of evil and suffering, and related issues such as miracles, religious experience, and the nature of religious language. These questions are not only abstract: they shape how believers understand God and how critics challenge those claims. For revision, it helps to treat each argument as a position with internal structure, supporting reasons, and well-known objections; being able to explain, evaluate and apply these to examples is the core of exam success.

## Arguments for the existence of God
Classical theistic arguments aim to show that belief in God is intellectually defensible. The ontological argument begins from the concept of God as a maximally great or perfect being and argues that existence is a necessary attribute of such a being. Anselm formulated this idea as a thought-experiment: if God is "that than which nothing greater can be conceived," then God must exist in reality because existing in reality is greater than existing only in the understanding. Descartes gave a rationalist version that treats existence as contained in the idea of a supremely perfect being. Critics respond by challenging the move from concept to reality; Kant famously argued that existence is not a predicate that adds to the concept of a thing, while Gaunilo used a parody (the perfect island) to show the form of the argument can be applied absurdly.

Cosmological arguments rely on causal or explanatory principles. Aquinas provided versions that argue from motion, causation and contingency to the need for an unmoved mover or necessary being. The basic idea is that an infinite regress of causes is unsatisfactory, so there must be a first cause or necessary foundation—God. The Kalam cosmological argument, which has been influential in contemporary debate, asserts that whatever begins to exist has a cause, the universe began to exist, therefore the universe has a cause. Objections include the challenge to the necessity of rejecting an infinite regress and problems with applying causal reasoning beyond the universe, as well as the question of why the first cause should have the attributes classical theism assigns to God.

Teleological or design arguments point to order, regularity or fine-tuning in the universe as evidence for design. While not the central focus here, design arguments often link to cosmological claims about the suitability of the cosmos for life. Responses range from naturalistic accounts such as evolution to the suggestion that apparent design does not require a personal designer.

When studying these arguments, it is important to set out premises clearly, explain supporting examples and show contemporary reformulations and criticisms so you can evaluate their overall force for believers and non-believers alike.

## The problem of evil and theodicies
The problem of evil is perhaps the most powerful challenge to belief in an omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent God. It is usually presented in two forms. The logical problem of evil claims that the existence of gratuitous suffering is inconsistent with such a God. The evidential problem of evil argues that the amount and distribution of suffering make belief improbable. Responses fall into the category of theodicy and defence. The free will defence argues that moral evil is a consequence of God giving free creatures genuine choice; the possibility of moral good requires risk. Augustine developed a theodicy that traces evil to the abuse of human free will and understands evil as privation rather than a created substance. Irenaeus offered a different approach, suggesting that suffering can be formative: the world is a 'soul-making' environment in which humans develop morally and spiritually through struggle.

In modern discussion John Hick reworked the Irenaean view into a universal soul-making theodicy which treats the world as epistemically challenging so that genuine moral growth is possible. Process theodicies, drawing on process philosophy, propose that God is not omnipotent in the classical sense; God works persuasively rather than coercively and so cannot unilaterally prevent all suffering. Swinburne offers a probabilistic response, arguing that certain kinds of suffering are necessary for greater goods such as the development of virtues, and that it is part of a wider design that makes belief reasonable.

Contestations include the scope of gratuitous evil, natural evil which seems unrelated to moral agency, and literary and philosophical critiques such as those found in the works of Dostoevsky and Camus, who explore the existential challenge suffering poses to faith. When evaluating theodicies, consider internal coherence, plausibility, and whether the proposed goods plausibly justify the evils described.

## Miracles: definition and debate
Miracles are typically understood as events that involve divine intervention that contravene natural regularities. Aquinas viewed miracles as acts by which God demonstrates power beyond created nature, while Hume provided a famous critique: Hume argued that reports of miracles are always less probable than natural explanations and that wise persons proportion their belief to the evidence. Hume’s method invites a strict weighing of testimonial evidence and historical reliability.

Contemporary philosophers offer more nuanced accounts. Swinburne develops a probabilistic framework that allows testimony of miracles to be assessed against the likelihood of natural explanations and the reliability of witnesses. Others, like Holland, treat some miraculous narratives as "signs" within a context that invites meaning rather than literal scientific verification. Challenges to miracle claims also come from the advance of natural science and psychological explanations for experiences deemed miraculous, such as coincidence, placebo effects, or misperception.

In exams, distinguish between the epistemic standards Hume demands and the kind of theological or experiential claims believers make. You should be able to explain Hume’s argument about human testimony and miracles, present replies, and apply these to particular cases that might appear in questions.

## Religious experience and its credentials
Religious experience covers a wide range of phenomena from conversion and visions to mystical union and numinous encounters. Rudolf Otto described the numinous as an encounter with the wholly other, a mixture of awe and fascination, while mystical writers such as Teresa of Avila report experiences of union with the divine. William James analysed religious experience as having qualities of ineffability, noetic quality, transiency and passivity, and argued that such experiences can be genuine sources of religious knowledge.

Arguments that religious experiences provide evidence for God emphasize their phenomenological immediacy and transformative effects on subjects’ lives. Critics offer psychological, neurological and sociological explanations, ranging from altered brain states to cultural conditioning. Verification is a central problem: how can private experience provide objective evidence? Hick responds with a pluralist interpretation suggesting experiences are shaped by cultural lenses and point to the same ultimate reality under different descriptions.

For examination answers, show awareness of different types of experiences, clarify what proponents claim they prove, and present strong skeptical responses. Demonstrate an understanding of the epistemological limits of first-person reports and how philosophers like James seek criteria for assessing credibility.

## Religious language and the limits of verification
Philosophical analysis of religious language asks what it is to make claims about God and whether such claims are meaningful. Medieval thinkers offered distinctions between equivocal, univocal and analogical language to account for how we speak meaningfully about God while avoiding category errors. The via negativa argues that God is best described by what God is not, pointing to the limits of positive predication.

In the twentieth century logical positivists proposed the verification principle, according to which a statement is meaningful only if it is empirically verifiable; on this account many religious claims seemed nonsensical. Wittgenstein later introduced the idea of language games to suggest that religious language functions within its own form of life and has meaning by internal standards rather than by external verification. These debates matter because they affect whether religious discourse can make truth-claims, express moral demands, or function as metaphor and symbol in communal life.

When revising, compare different theories of meaning and consider implications for how believers defend doctrine and how critics seek to undermine it.

## Afterlife, body, soul and personal identity
Questions about life after death concern whether personal identity can persist after bodily death. Dualist accounts, with roots in Plato, argue for an immaterial soul that survives the body. Materialist theories deny an immaterial soul and hold that consciousness depends on brain states; under this view personal survival after death is problematic. Philosophical positions such as the identity theory, epiphenomenalism and psychological continuity theories offer different ways to understand persons.

In religious contexts the resurrection of the body is a central claim in Christian theology, while some traditions accept reincarnation. John Hick proposed a replica theory of resurrection, suggesting God could create a perfect duplicate of a person in another realm; this raises questions about whether numerical identity is preserved. Near-death experiences are often cited as empirical data for survival, but explanations range from neurological causes to genuine glimpses of another reality.

For essays, articulate carefully what is meant by personal identity, explain competing theories and test their implications for religious beliefs about immortality.

## Faith, atheism and existential responses
Philosophy of religion also addresses broader existential questions about faith and the place of religion in a secular world. Existentialist writers wrestle with the meaning of existence without appealing to traditional theistic certainties. Kierkegaard argued that faith is a passionate, personal commitment that may involve a "leap" beyond reason, while atheistic existentialists like Sartre stress human freedom and responsibility in an indifferent universe. Contemporary atheism often combines empirical criticism with ethical claims about the role of religion in public life.

When engaging this material, balance the strengths and insights of existential critiques—such as the emphasis on authenticity and moral responsibility—against the theistic responses that seek to preserve meaning and moral grounding. A-level answers benefit from showing how philosophical positions interact with lived human concerns and other aspects of human experience, such as social and political consequences.

## Exam technique
In answers, aim to demonstrate both AO1 and AO2: clear knowledge and understanding, and careful analysis and evaluation. Begin by defining key terms and outlining the argument or theory you will discuss. For AO1, explain the structure of arguments (premises and conclusion), show familiarity with main proponents and variants, and use examples to clarify points. For AO2, assess strengths and weaknesses, consider plausible counter-arguments, and respond to those objections where appropriate. Where questions invite synoptic thinking, connect themes across units—for example, use material on religious experience when evaluating miracle claims, or employ ethical considerations when discussing theodicies.

Write with clarity and organisation: each paragraph should develop a single point, and signpost where your critique is leading. Use scholars and philosophers by name when relevant to show depth, but focus on philosophical content rather than biography. When asked to “evaluate,” spend roughly half of your answer setting up the view and half weighing it against alternatives, concluding with a reasoned judgement that explains which considerations you find most persuasive and why. Finally, practice past-style questions under timed conditions, plan essays briefly before writing, and annotate answers with brief signposts to help examiners follow your argument.
