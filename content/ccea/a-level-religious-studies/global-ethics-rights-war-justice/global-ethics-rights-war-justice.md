# Global Ethics: Rights, War & Justice (A-level Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: what “global ethics” asks and why it matters
Global ethics examines moral questions that cross national boundaries and affect entire communities of people. It asks how we should treat other human beings when their lives are shaped by global forces such as migration, war, trade, climate change and international law. At A‑level the topic invites you to move between abstract moral theory and concrete moral problems: you must understand theories that justify rights and obligations, and you must also apply them to issues such as sexual identity and gender justice, the ethics of warfare, the aims and limits of punishment, and the demand to tolerate difference. A well-rounded answer will show knowledge of philosophical and religious resources for thinking about rights and justice, awareness of historical development (for example of modern human rights), and sensitivity to contemporary dilemmas where values clash.

## Moral theory and the foundations of judgement
Moral theory provides the tools we use to justify ethical claims. Virtue ethics, revived in modern philosophy after Aristotle, asks not “What rule should I follow?” but “What sort of person should I become?” Modern proponents emphasise character and flourishing and include writers who have argued for virtues as central to moral life. Ethical relativism, by contrast, holds that moral truth varies with culture or community, a position that raises immediate difficulties for global standards such as human rights. Debates about free will and determinism are also important because they affect moral responsibility. Hard determinists deny genuine free choice and so challenge traditional ideas of praise and blame; compatibilists argue that freedom can coexist with causal explanation; libertarians insist on indeterministic freedom. The practical upshot is that your view about free will changes how you interpret punishment, responsibility and moral praise. When you answer exam questions, be ready to explain how each theoretical stance leads to different responses to global problems, and to show the strengths and weaknesses of each.

## Human rights and global justice: origins, nature and critiques
The modern language of human rights grew out of philosophical developments and historical crises. Early thinkers who shaped rights discourse argued from natural law or subjectivity: the idea that individuals have claims against rulers. The later emergence of universal declarations and international law set out rights as claims that belong to every person simply as a human being. There are competing philosophical accounts: some see rights as grounded in human dignity or autonomy, others as instruments for securing wellbeing. Bentham’s classic critique described “natural rights” as nonsense, arguing instead for legal protections judged by their social utility.

In applying rights to global justice you must distinguish between the conceptual question (“What is a right?”) and the practical one (“How are rights enforced across borders?”). Cultural and religious critiques argue that universal human rights can be a form of western imperialism if they ignore local traditions. Feminist and postcolonial critics point out that rights language can mask unequal power relations unless it attends to economic, social and gendered injustices. The topic of animal rights introduces another axis: what counts as moral subjecthood and which beings have claims upon us? When you write about rights, balance historical explanation with contemporary examples such as refugee protection, labour rights in global supply chains, and international mechanisms for enforcing rights. Show awareness that rights language is powerful but contested.

## Sexual identity, gender justice and contested rights
Issues of sexual identity and gender justice are central to global ethics because they expose conflicts between religious traditions, cultural norms and evolving legal frameworks. Questions you will face include the moral status of same‑sex relationships, the rights to marry and parent, access to contraception and reproductive health services, and the protection of women from practices such as female genital cutting or honour‑based violence. Different ethical frameworks lead to different conclusions: a rights‑based liberal approach stresses autonomy and equal protection under law; some religious moralities appeal to doctrines about the nature of marriage or human flourishing; feminist ethics prioritises power, oppression and the lived experience of women.

In assessing these controversies you should bring evidence to bear: consider how laws have changed in different countries, how religious communities have responded, and how human rights instruments attempt to protect vulnerable people. Be prepared to weigh the claims of cultural relativism against principles of universal justice, and to show how concepts such as dignity, equality and harm are used by both advocates and critics.

## War, peace and the ethics of armed conflict
Global ethics takes an especial interest in the morality of war because armed conflict crosses borders and affects civilian populations, refugees and future generations. The Just War tradition is the main systematic framework used to judge the morality of warfare. It is usually divided into criteria for going to war (Jus ad Bellum), criteria for conduct during war (Jus in Bello), and criteria for the aftermath (Jus post Bellum). Key issues include legitimate authority to declare war, a just cause, right intention, proportionality, reasonable chance of success, the protection of non‑combatants, and the limits on permissible means.

Contemporary questions complicate traditional frameworks: asymmetric warfare, terrorism, drone strikes, cyber war and weapons of mass destruction raise hard problems about discrimination and proportionality. Pacifist traditions reject war altogether and emphasise non‑violence; consequentialist perspectives may allow some actions denied by deontological or virtue‑ethical accounts. Use historical or recent examples such as humanitarian interventions, debates over the Iraq war, or controversy around nuclear deterrence to show how theory meets practice. A strong answer will consider the moral weight of civilian suffering, the responsibilities of long‑powerful states toward weaker ones, and the moral complexity of decisions taken under uncertainty.

## Justice, law and punishment: aims and dilemmas
The purposes we assign to punishment shape criminal justice systems and influence debates about capital punishment, rehabilitation, and diminished responsibility. Traditional aims include protection of society, retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation and vindication of moral order. Religious perspectives may emphasise restorative processes and the possibility of repentance; utilitarian accounts stress consequences such as deterrence or prevention; retributive theories focus on moral desert.

Difficulties arise when these aims conflict. Retribution and rehabilitation can pull in opposite directions: how do we balance the demand for justice with the need to restore offenders where possible? Capital punishment forces the ethical debate to intensify: defenders argue for retribution or deterrence, critics appeal to the risk of miscarriage of justice, the sanctity of life, and disproportionate application against marginalised groups. The concept of diminished responsibility recognises that psychological, social or neurological factors can reduce blameworthiness, raising practical questions about punishment and treatment. When dealing with justice in a global context, also consider transitional justice after mass atrocity, the role of international criminal tribunals, and restorative models that prioritize reconciliation and repair over pure retribution.

## Conscience, freedom and tolerance in plural societies
Conscience is central to many claims about moral duty. Religious individuals often appeal to conscience as a guide to right action; secular moralities may locate conscience in reasoned moral judgment. The state must balance protection of conscience against the protection of others’ rights. This produces recurring dilemmas: should a doctor be allowed a conscience clause to refuse to perform procedures such as abortion? Should businesses be permitted to refuse services to same‑sex couples on religious grounds? The concept of freedom of belief is legally protected in many societies, but freedom to act on belief can be restricted where it harms others.

Tolerance is often presented as the civic virtue that allows plural societies to coexist, but tolerance has limits. When beliefs or practices violate basic human rights, tolerance becomes contested. Fundamentalism and rigid orthodoxy can close off dialogue, but so too can illiberal public policies that exclude minority voices. Use examples such as asylum seekers punished for conscience‑based political action, or the status of prisoners of conscience, to show the uneven effects of state power. In your answers aim to show how protecting the common good and individual liberty sometimes pull in different directions, and argue for principled ways to resolve those tensions.

## Exam technique
To do well in A‑level questions on Global Ethics you must demonstrate both AO1 (knowledge and understanding) and AO2 (analysis and evaluation). Start by identifying exactly what the question asks, then plan a clear line of argument: define key terms, state the relevant ethical framework(s), and map the essay’s sequence. Use theory to illuminate practice: when discussing rights, set out the philosophical basis before applying it to an issue such as refugees or gender justice. When tackling war, outline Just War criteria and then evaluate them against a concrete case. Be synoptic where appropriate: connect ideas from other units (for example, link virtue ethics or religious teachings from earlier study to global questions).

In analysis, show awareness of strengths and weaknesses. Always give at least one strong counter‑argument and respond to it; examiners reward balanced evaluation and independent thought. Use well‑chosen examples to make abstract points concrete, but do not let narrative overwhelm analysis. Manage your time so you can draft a concise introduction, two or three developed analytical paragraphs, and a short conclusion that answers the question directly. Write clearly and precisely, using specialist vocabulary correctly and ensuring good grammar and spelling. Finally, practice past questions under timed conditions, and in revision rehearsals make sure you can bring in relevant scholars, scriptural or philosophical material, and up‑to‑date examples that demonstrate the real‑world significance of ethical theory.
