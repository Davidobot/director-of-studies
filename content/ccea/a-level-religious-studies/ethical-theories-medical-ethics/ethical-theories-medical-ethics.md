# Ethical Theories & Medical Ethics (A-level Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview
This topic brings together two connected strands of the specification: the foundations of ethical theory and their application to contemporary issues in medical ethics. At A-level you are expected to understand core ethical approaches, explain their development and key features, and then apply those theories to problems such as abortion, euthanasia, assisted reproduction and embryo research. Answers should move beyond description: you will need to analyse strengths and weaknesses, relate religious and secular positions, and where appropriate connect your discussion to other areas of the course such as biblical ethics, the role of conscience, or philosophical challenges to moral reasoning.

## Major ethical frameworks
Ethical theory is often introduced by distinguishing broad families of approaches. Deontological ethics judges actions by appeal to rules, duties or rights; teleological ethics judges actions by their consequences; virtue ethics emphasises moral character; and situation ethics offers a context-sensitive, person-centred alternative. On deontological lines, Christian Scripture and traditions of natural moral law have been influential in shaping rule-based responses. Teleological approaches are most clearly represented by utilitarianism, which assesses right action by reference to overall happiness or wellbeing. Virtue ethics looks back to Aristotle and has been revived in modern Christian thinking through writers who emphasise formation of character and community virtues. Situation ethics, developed in the twentieth century by thinkers influenced by the moral teaching of Jesus, places love (agape) at the centre and argues that moral decision making must attend to the concrete circumstances of a situation rather than to fixed rules alone. Understanding how these families of thought prioritize different moral goods — duty, consequence, character or love — is the starting point for applying ethics to medical dilemmas.

## Natural moral law and biblical ethics
Natural moral law is a classical deontological approach largely associated with Aquinas in the Christian tradition. It distinguishes between primary precepts, fundamental goods that flow from human nature (such as life, reproduction, education and living in society), and secondary precepts, particular moral rules derived from reflection on those goods. Christian approaches that draw on Scripture place emphasis on the Decalogue and the moral teaching found in the Sermon on the Mount as authoritative guides. In exams you should be able to explain how natural moral law claims a rational order to human life that ethics can discern, and how this underpins conservative responses in medical ethics: for example, arguments that intentionally ending innocent human life is always wrong because it violates the primary good of life. Modern refinements such as proportionalism acknowledge that moral rules may admit exceptions when precepts conflict, and this opens space for more nuanced reasoning. When discussing biblical ethics, link textual teachings to practical implications: consider how different Christian traditions interpret key texts and how those readings influence positions on abortion, euthanasia and reproductive technology.

## Utilitarianism and situation ethics
Utilitarianism is a teleological theory that measures moral rightness by reference to the outcome most likely to maximise overall happiness or welfare. Classical utilitarians argued for a quantitative calculus of pleasure and pain, while later thinkers introduced qualitative distinctions and broader notions of wellbeing. Contemporary utilitarian thought also informs secular bioethical debates, especially where public policy, resource allocation and consequences for society are at stake. Situation ethics, by contrast, resists rigid calculations or fixed rules and asks whether an action exemplifies agapeic love in the particular context. It can sometimes lead to similar practical conclusions as consequentialist reasoning — for instance, when giving priority to the best outcome for a patient — but it roots the decision in relational and moral concern rather than in an abstract utility function. When comparing these approaches, pay attention to common criticisms: utilitarianism can be accused of sacrificing individual rights for aggregate benefits, while situation ethics may be criticised for lack of clear guidance and potential subjectivity. Use these tensions to evaluate specific medical cases: which approach best respects patients’ dignity, which makes for just public policy, and how do religious commitments alter the balance of reasons?

## Life and death issues: abortion, euthanasia and personhood
Life-and-death questions are central to medical ethics because they bring into relief competing values: sanctity of life, autonomy, compassion, and considerations of suffering and dignity. Debates about abortion turn on questions of moral status and personhood — when does the fetus acquire rights, and how should those rights be balanced against the pregnant woman’s bodily autonomy, health and social circumstances? Religious positions often appeal to sanctity and the inviolability of human life from conception, while many secular positions emphasise bodily autonomy, women’s rights and varying accounts of gradualist personhood. The doctrine of double effect, familiar from natural law reasoning, is an important tool: it distinguishes intended outcomes from foreseeable but unintended side effects and is used in some ethical defences of difficult clinical acts.

Euthanasia and assisted dying raise distinct but related questions. Defenders appeal to autonomy and compassion, arguing that intractable suffering can make assisted death a humane option; opponents stress intrinsic human worth, the risks of abuse and the integrity of the doctor–patient relationship. The slippery slope argument is commonly invoked on both sides: proponents worry that denying choice can lead to avoidable cruelty, opponents worry that permitting killing in some cases will erode safeguards and devalue vulnerable lives. Philosophical debates about personhood and the nature of suffering, and theological questions about the meaning of life and death, are therefore integral to reasoned positions on these issues.

## Reproduction, embryos and biotechnology
Advances in reproductive medicine and genetics have created morally complex choices. Assisted conception techniques such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and surrogacy pose ethical questions about the status and disposal of embryos, parental responsibility, commodification of reproduction and the welfare of children. Embryo research, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and mitochondrial donation (so-called three-parent babies) intensify debates about the moral status of the embryo, the permissibility of manipulating human life, and the social consequences of selecting for or against particular traits. Ethical responses draw on many resources: natural moral law claims respect for embryonic life; utilitarian approaches may endorse interventions that reduce suffering and disease; situation ethics may focus on the wellbeing of the family and future child.

Legal and regulatory frameworks matter here. In the UK context, the role of a statutory body such as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority is central: it mediates between scientific possibility, public values and legal constraints. When writing about bioethics, always situate your evaluation in the practical landscape — consider the cultural, legal and institutional mechanisms that shape what is permissible and how ethical principles are operationalised. This helps you to move from abstract moral claims to realistic assessments of policy and practice.

## Conscience, rights and the role of religion
Two recurring themes run through applied ethical debates: the role of conscience and freedom of belief, and the interplay between religious and secular moral claims in plural societies. Conscience can be presented as a guide to personal moral responsibility, but it must be balanced against professional duties, the rights of others and legal obligations. Human rights frameworks introduce another layer: arguments about equality, non-discrimination and access to healthcare sometimes conflict with religious-based exemptions. In every answer, consider how competing goods can be negotiated: what counts as a reasonable limitation on conscience claims, how should public policy protect minority beliefs while ensuring social justice, and how do different ethical systems prioritise competing values? These questions invite synoptic thinking, drawing on philosophy of religion, textual studies and social ethics to produce a well-rounded discussion.

## Exam technique
In essays and shorter answers you must show both AO1 (knowledge and understanding) and AO2 (analysis and evaluation). Begin with a clear definition of the theory or ethical issue you are addressing, and outline its key features using precise terminology. When applying theory to medical cases, state the factual background briefly and then explain how the theory leads to particular moral judgements. To reach higher bands, do not stop at description: weigh strengths and weaknesses, consider rival perspectives and anticipate counter-arguments. Use examples — real cases, hypothetical scenarios or legal frameworks such as the role of a regulatory body — to illustrate abstract points. Where the question invites synoptic thinking, make explicit connections to other units: for instance, bring in scriptural sources when assessing Christian ethical responses, or refer to philosophical problems about personhood from the philosophy of religion. Keep your writing organised with clear paragraphs, signpost your argument, and ensure accuracy in spelling, grammar and specialist vocabulary. Time your exam to allow planning, a well-structured middle section and a concluding evaluation that answers the question directly.
