# Gospel of Luke (A-level Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview and purpose of Luke’s Gospel
The Gospel of Luke presents a carefully constructed account of the life, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus with particular theological aims. Luke and Acts form a two-volume work in which the evangelist traces the story of God’s saving action from the birth of John the Baptist to the spread of the gospel across the Mediterranean world. Luke sets out to show that the Christian message is for Jews and Gentiles alike and to explain how the Jesus movement developed into a community with a mission to the whole world. The writing is both narrative and apologetic: Luke shapes events to communicate convictions about Jesus as the fulfilment of God’s promise, the nature of God’s kingdom, and the proper response of disciples. For revision it is helpful to hold these twin purposes in mind—Luke as historian-narrator and Luke as theologian-apologist—because they explain many of his emphases and editorial choices.

## Authorship, date and sources
Traditionally the author is identified as Luke, a Gentile physician and companion of Paul, and the prologue to Luke/Acts suggests an author who had access to eyewitness testimony and earlier written sources. Modern scholarship generally accepts Luke’s literary dependence on Mark for much of his narrative material, on a hypothetical sayings source (Q) for shared material with Matthew, and on unique material often labelled "L" for Luke’s own material. The dating of Luke is commonly placed in the late first century, though scholars propose a range from the 60s to the 90s CE; the later date fits the shaped theology and the perspective on the church’s mission. Luke’s overt concern with historical order and his polished Greek style mark the work as addressed to readers who value reasoned argument as well as devotional narrative.

## Historical and religious context
Understanding Luke requires attention to the religious and political setting of first‑century Palestine and the wider Roman world. Jewish life was shaped by sects and movements such as the Pharisees and Sadducees, which Luke portrays in narrative encounters that often lead to controversy. Roman rule and its institutions form the political backdrop: scenes such as the census, the presence of centurions and the trial before Pilate locate the story in imperial reality. Equally important is the social context. Luke repeatedly highlights the poor, outcasts, women and foreigners, showing Jesus’ ministry as one that subverts social expectations and extends God’s mercy beyond Israel’s boundaries. This attention to marginalised groups connects the narrative to broader questions about justice, ritual, and community in any age.

## Key narratives: infancy, baptism and early ministry
Luke opens with an extended infancy narrative that is distinctive in its focus on Mary, the angelic annunciations, the songs of praise, and the theme of reversal—God exalting the lowly and humbling the proud. These opening chapters set the tone for Luke’s theological concerns: a God who acts in history and who brings salvation to the unexpected. The narrative of Jesus’ baptism and temptation then marks the public beginning of his ministry and frames his identity and vocation. Luke’s early ministry scenes include the rejection at Nazareth and clashes with religious authorities; these passages establish both the prophetic nature of Jesus’ mission and the pattern of opposition that will culminate in his passion. When revising these narratives, pay attention to how Luke arranges episodes to underline themes such as continuity with Israel, prophetic fulfilment and the inauguration of God’s kingdom.

## Parables, miracles and the Kingdom of God
Luke’s parables and miracles illuminate the Kingdom of God from complementary angles. The parables often emphasise mercy, forgiveness and inclusion: the Good Samaritan redefines neighbourliness across ethnic and religious boundaries, the Forgiving Father (the Prodigal Son) explores repentance and divine mercy, and the Rich Man and Lazarus warns about the consequences of indifference to the poor. Luke also collects parables that explain growth and invitation—such as the Sower and the Great Banquet—showing the kingdom as both present and future. Miracles in Luke function as signs of that kingdom: healings, raisings and nature miracles demonstrate restoration and God’s breaking into creation. Students should learn to explain both the narrative role of these stories and the theological claims they make. When considering the historicity or credibility of miracles, distinguish between their literary function within Luke’s theology and debates about empirical verification.

## Discipleship, mission and Salvation History
Luke develops a sustained portrait of what it means to be a disciple. Calls to follow, teachings on the demands of discipleship, instructions for mission, and portrayals of failure and restoration (such as Peter’s denial and restoration) all explore the cost and character of following Jesus. Luke’s mission passages, including the sending of the seventy and instructions on travel and witness, show a community shaped for outreach. Underpinning this is Luke’s concept of Salvation History: an interpretative framework that reads the life of Jesus as the climax of God’s saving purposes, rooted in Israel’s narrative and now extended to the gentile world. Revision should track how Luke connects particular episodes—infancy scenes, temple motifs, passion narrative—to a grand theological storyline that moves from promise to fulfilment and from Jerusalem to the nations.

## Luke and human experience: social concern, ritual and the role of the sacred text
Luke invites readers to reflect on timeless human questions. His concern for the marginalised challenges students to think about the social ethics of the text: poverty, charity, hospitality and reversal of fortunes are constant themes with contemporary resonance. Luke also engages with ritual and initiation: the prominence of prayer, table fellowship, baptismal language and the eucharistic-like meal scenes all suggest the continuing role of ritual in forming community identity. Finally, Luke’s use of scripture—his frequent citation and reworking of Old Testament themes—raises questions about the authority and interpretation of sacred texts. For learners, it is useful to consider how Luke’s re-presentation of scripture functions both to root Jesus in Israel’s story and to reshape that tradition for a new, inclusive community.

## Critical approaches and interpretative challenges
Approaching Luke critically means combining literary, historical and theological methods. Source criticism helps explain differences and agreements between the Synoptic Gospels; narrative criticism highlights Luke’s editorial art in ordering episodes and shaping character; social-scientific readings illuminate the gospel’s social concerns; and canonical approaches situate Luke within the wider sweep of New Testament theology. Challenging questions include the historical reliability of infancy narratives, the extent to which Luke idealises the early church, and how Luke’s theological goals shaped his handling of history. Students should practice weighing evidence and recognising how different interpretive frameworks illuminate different aspects of the text. Learning to discuss strengths and weaknesses of scholarly positions—while relating them back to the text itself—will strengthen both knowledge and evaluation.

## Exam technique
In preparing for exam questions on Luke, aim for clear, balanced essays that combine accurate knowledge of the text with critical evaluation. Start answers by defining key terms and signalling the line of argument. Use precise narrative detail to support AO1: refer to specific episodes, parables or sayings and explain their theological significance. For AO2, assess alternative readings, noting scholarly debates where appropriate but always linking interpretation back to the text and to wider human experience. When asked about themes such as the Kingdom of God, mercy, discipleship or Luke’s historical reliability, show how these themes develop across the gospel and, for A2 synoptic questions, link them to Acts or another unit. Structure responses so that each paragraph makes a clear point, supports it with evidence, and then evaluates it. Time management is crucial: for longer synoptic essays plan with a brief outline, spend the middle sections developing argument and evidence, and reserve time to conclude by weighing up competing perspectives. Quality of written communication matters; aim for clarity, accurate grammar and appropriate theological vocabulary. Finally, practice past questions under timed conditions and seek feedback on how well you balance description and critical analysis—this combination is what examiners look for.
