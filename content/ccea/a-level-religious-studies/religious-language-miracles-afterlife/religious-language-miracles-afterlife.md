# Religious Language, Miracles & Afterlife (A-level Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview
This topic brings together central issues in philosophy of religion and theology that are frequently examined at A-level: how religious language works, whether miracles can be defended or explained, and what claims can be made about life after death. Students are expected to understand classical positions, key thinkers and critical responses, and to make connections between philosophical argument, religious belief and wider human experience. The exam expects both accurate knowledge (AO1) and thoughtful analysis and evaluation (AO2), so revision should combine precise definitions and textual detail with reasoned criticism and real‑world examples.

## Religious language: forms, functions and challenges
Religious language raises the question of whether and how statements about God and ultimate reality can be meaningful. Medieval philosophy introduced distinctions between equivocal, univocal and analogical language. Equivocal language uses the same word with completely different meanings; univocal language uses the same meaning in different contexts; analogical language allows qualified similarity, so that when we call God “good” we do not mean the same kind of goodness as in humans but something truly related. This idea was important for maintaining both the transcendence of God and the possibility of speaking about God intelligibly.

The twentieth century brought new challenges. Logical Positivism and the Verification Principle claimed that only statements verifiable by empirical observation or analytic truth are meaningful, which casts doubt on religious assertions. In reaction, philosophers developed alternative accounts. Wittgenstein’s later work suggested that religious language functions within its own "language game": within a faith community words have meaning through use, practice and form of life rather than scientific verification. This route shifts attention from propositional truth to the role religious language plays in believers’ lives.

When studying religious language, it helps to contrast the aims of literal and non‑literal interpretation. Literalism treats sacred texts as factual reports; liberal or symbolic readings treat some passages as metaphor, myth or moral teaching. Consider practical classroom examples such as the difference between reading “God is love” as a metaphysical claim and reading it as an ethical summons. Strong answers will show awareness of how the scientific worldview challenges religious claims and how believers and philosophers respond by reinterpreting meaning and truth.

## Miracles: definition, arguments and the critique
A clear starting point is to define a miracle. Classical definitions see miracles as events brought about by God that break or suspend natural laws; others allow broader senses such as extraordinary coincidences or events with religious significance. Aquinas saw miracles as acts beyond created nature, serving God’s purposes. By contrast, David Hume famously argued that miracles are violations of the laws of nature and that the evidence for them is never strong enough to outweigh the uniform experience that such laws hold. His argument rests on the idea that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence; testimony is often unreliable and subject to error, deceit or misunderstanding.

Contemporary responses refine both sides. Some philosophers treat miracles as events that are best explained as signs interpreted within a religious framework rather than as literal law‑breaking. Others argue for a probabilistic approach: if the background probability of a natural law being breached is extremely low, then even good testimony may not establish a miracle, but cumulative testimony and corroborating evidence can raise the plausibility. Philosophers such as Swinburne have argued that, on theism, miracles are not only possible but to be expected as purposeful divine actions, and that testimony should be weighed in a framework of background knowledge about God’s existence.

When teaching miracles, it is effective to address different senses of the term: miracles as supernatural interventions, miracles as signs that point to a divine purpose, and miracles as events that are simply not yet explained. Use case studies such as healing accounts, claimed resuscitations and natural disasters interpreted religiously, and ask students to weigh naturalistic explanations (coincidence, psychosomatic recovery, misperception) against testimonial and communal religious contexts.

## Religious experience: types, credentials and critique
Religious experience is often offered as a source of knowledge about God. Experiences fall into types: visions, mystical union, conversion experiences, and numinous encounters. Rudolf Otto described the numinous as a non‑rational, awe‑filled encounter with the "wholly other" characterised by both fascination and dread. Mystics such as Teresa of Avila wrote of profound inward experiences of union with God; existentialist accounts stress the personal transformation that follows genuine encounters with ultimate reality.

Assessing the credentials of religious experience requires questions about verification and explanation. Supporters claim that personal experience can provide direct evidence of the divine in the same way perceptual experiences provide evidence of the external world. Critics argue that religious experiences are susceptible to natural explanations: psychological or neurological conditions, hallucination, cultural conditioning, or non‑religious cognitive states. Near‑death experiences are a good classroom example: they can be read as supportive of an afterlife, but they may also be explained by brain activity during trauma. Philosophically, the challenge is to show how an individual report can be moved from subjective conviction to public justification. Hick’s pluralist approach invites students to consider whether different religious experiences point to one reality interpreted through cultural lenses.

Teaching religious experience benefits from primary extracts and from encouraging students to evaluate both descriptive content and epistemic weight. Encourage them to ask whether a pattern of independent, cross‑cultural reports strengthens the case, and whether communal validation within a faith tradition counts as a form of corroboration.

## Afterlife, body, soul and personal identity
Debates about life after death connect metaphysics, anthropology and religious doctrine. Dualist traditions, which find roots in Plato and continue in many Christian theologies, hold that a non‑physical soul survives bodily death. Materialist positions deny any ontologically distinct soul and claim that personal identity is tied to the brain and body; once brain function irreversibly ceases, the person ceases. Intermediate positions explore emergent properties, epiphenomenalism or the identity theory which identifies mental states with physical brain states.

Philosophical problems arise when one asks what it would mean for a person to survive death and still be the same person. Is continuity psychological, physical, or both? Views such as Hick’s replica theory imagine resurrection as God creating a numerically identical body that houses the same person, but this raises questions about duplication and identity. Reincarnation claims face similar puzzles: if memories and personality traits persist, in what sense is the person the same?

Near‑death experiences, reported recollections of an afterlife, and religious doctrines of resurrection or immortality are common reference points in exams. Students should be able to describe different theories and highlight strengths and weaknesses: dualism can accommodate intuitions about personal survival but struggles to explain interaction; materialism fits scientific frameworks but struggles with common religious claims; resurrection doctrines claim continuity through divine action, which raises metaphysical and evidential questions.

## The problem of evil and theodicies
The existence of suffering and evil is the central challenge to theism. Distinguishing moral evil, caused by free agents, from natural evil, such as earthquakes, sharpens the analysis. Theodicies are attempts to show the compatibility of evil with an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God. The Augustinian theodicy locates evil in human free will and privation of good; the Irenaean theodicy sees suffering as soul‑making, a necessary environment for moral and spiritual growth. Process theodicies reconceptualise God’s power as persuasive rather than coercive, so God cannot unilaterally prevent all evil without overriding creaturely freedom.

Critics offer powerful replies. The logical problem of evil asks whether the traditional attributes of God are logically consistent with the extent and distribution of suffering. Evidential arguments contend that the amount and kinds of apparently pointless suffering make God’s existence unlikely. Writers such as Dostoyevsky and Camus pose existential challenges: the experience of suffering sometimes makes faith appear morally intolerable. Responses include appeals to greater goods, the unknowability of God’s purposes, and the value of free will for authentic moral agency. Good answers balance empathy with philosophical rigour: acknowledge the moral force of the problem and show why certain theodicies remain philosophically contentious.

## Making connections and classroom application
This cluster of topics rewards synoptic thinking. Religious language problems feed into debates about miracles and religious experience: if religious statements are understood as non‑cognitive, then miracle claims function primarily as expressions of faith. The problem of evil affects how believers interpret reports of divine action. Questions about the afterlife link to ethics and personal identity: what would survival mean for moral responsibility and justice? In teaching, use cross‑cutting case studies to show how a single example can be read through multiple frameworks: a reported healing invites linguistic, epistemic, ethical and metaphysical analysis. Encourage students to practise moving from a clear statement of a theory to its application, criticism and a considered conclusion that weighs the strengths and limits of available responses.

## Exam technique
In exams, answers should combine accurate AO1 material with sustained AO2 evaluation. Start answers by defining key terms and outlining the main position you will explain. For AO1 make sure you present thinkers and theories fairly and with relevant detail. For AO2 move beyond description: identify strengths, expose weaknesses, compare alternatives and, where appropriate, bring in other aspects of human experience such as historical context, scientific perspectives or ethical implications. For longer A2 questions, plan a clear structure with an introduction, distinct paragraphs for argument and counter‑argument, and a conclusion that answers the question directly. Use examples to illustrate abstract points, and where synoptic themes are required show explicit links to at least one other unit of study, for example connecting miracle testimony to religious experience or connecting theodicies to ethical consequences for believers. Manage your time so that you leave a few minutes to proofread and ensure your writing is clear, accurate and uses appropriate terminology. Quality of written communication is assessed, so precise vocabulary and coherent expression earn marks as well as philosophical insight.
