# Islam: Beliefs, Qur’an & Practice (A-level Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## The life of Muhammad and the historical context
Understanding Islam’s beliefs and practices begins with the life of Muhammad, who was born in Mecca around 570 CE into the Quraysh tribe. The turning point of his life is the first revelation on Mount Hira, experienced during what Muslims call Laylat al‑Qadr (the Night of Power), when he began to receive the messages that make up the Qur’an. Early preaching in Mecca, focused on the oneness of God, social justice and the rejection of idolatry, met resistance and persecution. The migration (Hijra) to Medina in 622 CE marks the start of the Muslim community (ummah) as a polity and is used to reckon the Islamic calendar. In Medina Muhammad became not only a prophet and teacher but also a community and military leader, negotiating treaties, administering disputes and leading campaigns that eventually resulted in the peaceful return to Mecca. His Farewell Sermon and death in 632 CE are important milestones; his life is central for Muslims as the model (uswa hasana) of conduct. For exam answers, treat the biography as a window into how religious leadership, revelation and community formation interact: Muhammad’s roles as prophet, lawgiver and exemplar shape Muslim belief and practice.

## The Qur’an: revelation, compilation and structure
The Qur’an is the formative text of Islam and is understood by Muslims as God’s final revelation to humanity, conveyed through Muhammad. Revelation began in the early Meccan period and continued into the Medinan years; these phases often produce contrasts in tone and subject: Meccan surahs tend to stress creed, the afterlife and monotheism, while Medinan surahs address community organisation, law and inter‑communal relations. After Muhammad’s death, the text of the Qur’an was memorised and transmitted orally as well as written on various materials. The early compilations under the first Caliphs led to the standardised codex associated with Uthman; variant readings were reduced to a standard text in order to preserve unity of recitation. Classical Islamic scholarship emphasises Arabic as the language of the Qur’an and regards its linguistic features as integral to its authority.

Students should be able to explain how the Qur’an functions for believers: as scripture, lawgiver, moral guide and focus of worship. Its relationship with the Sunnah (the Prophet’s ways) and Hadith literature (reports of sayings and actions) is essential for deriving law and practice. The role of the Qur’an in devotional life—memorisation, recitation (tajwid) and use in liturgy—also shows why questions about compilation, preservation and contemporary interpretation are central to A‑level study.

## Sources of authority and the development of Sharia
Muslim religious authority is not reducible to the Qur’an alone. The Sunnah and Hadith collections provide context, exemplification and detail for Qur’anic injunctions. Different communities place differing emphasis on particular collections and chains of transmission, and this is one reason for diversity within Islam. From these textual sources emerged Sharia—broadly understood as the body of law and ethical guidance for communal life. The classical legal schools (madhhabs) such as Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi‘i and Hanbali in Sunni Islam, and the Ja‘fari school in Shi‘ism, developed methods of interpretation (usul al‑fiqh), principles of analogy, consensus and reasoning to apply scripture to new circumstances. Explain in essays how source hierarchy and interpretative method shape differing legal and ethical outcomes. In contemporary contexts, debates about the role of Sharia in the state, the compatibility of Sharia with human rights, and the place of ijtihad (independent reasoning) versus taqlid (legal imitation) are crucial for understanding how authority functions today.

## The Five Pillars and the forms of worship
Islamic belief is expressed through committed practice, famously summarised in the Five Pillars. The declaration of faith (Shahada) encapsulates Tawhid—the uncompromising oneness of God—and marks conversion. The five daily prayers (Salat), preceded by ritual ablution (wudu), structure a Muslim’s day and demonstrate communal and personal orientation to God; the Friday congregation (Jumu‘ah) has particular communal significance. Zakat, the mandated almsgiving, institutionalises social responsibility and redistributive justice; while rates and bases vary historically and legally, the principle of caring for the needy is constant. Sawm during Ramadan cultivates discipline, empathy and spiritual reflection, culminating in the festival of Eid al‑Fitr. Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, involves specified rites (tawaf around the Ka‘ba, sa‘i between Safa and Marwa, standing at Arafat) and symbolises unity and submission before God; Eid al‑Adha commemorates Abrahamic sacrifice. When describing these practices, emphasise both their ritual details and their theological meanings: they enact identity, ethics and community, and they provide frequent opportunities to reflect on doctrine in lived form.

## Worship spaces, the mosque and communal life
The mosque (masjid) functions as place of prayer, education and community organisation. Architectural features—the prayer hall oriented to the qibla, the minaret, the mihrab indicating direction of prayer, and facilities for ritual washing—serve liturgical needs, while imams and community leaders perform religious and social roles. The mosque’s role often extends into welfare, dispute mediation and civic engagement, especially in minority contexts where it can be a hub for cultural as well as religious identity. Discussing the mosque helps students connect ritual form to social function: how architecture and practice support theology and how local needs shape mosque life. Consider too debates about women’s participation in worship spaces, leadership roles and gendered spaces within religious buildings: these are often contested and reflect a spectrum of interpretations.

## Sunni and Shi’a: origins, beliefs and contemporary significance
The split between Sunni and Shi’a Islam has roots in the crisis of leadership after Muhammad’s death: differing views about legitimate succession developed into distinct theological and ritual traditions. Sunni Islam emphasises the community’s choice of caliph and developed the four major legal schools. Shi’a Islam emphasises the family of the Prophet and the special spiritual authority of the Imams; within Shi‘ism there are groups such as the Twelvers and the Ismailis, differing on the number and role of Imams and on messianic expectations like the Mahdi. Ashura, the commemoration of Husayn’s martyrdom at Karbala, highlights martyrdom and suffering in Shi‘a identity and practices of mourning and public ritual. While the doctrinal differences are important, contemporary significance often lies in political and social expressions of identity, especially where communal memory and historical grievances intersect with modern geopolitics. Be ready to explain both the theological distinctions and how the Sunni‑Shi‘a divide affects contemporary religious and political life.

## Contemporary issues: women, family life and ethical debates
Modern contexts raise a range of questions about how traditional texts and juristic reasoning apply to family law, gender equality and bioethical dilemmas. Surah 4 (An‑Nisa) addresses some aspects of family relations, inheritance and women’s rights, and it is often central to debates about gender justice. Interpretations vary widely: some Muslims argue for reformist readings that emphasise equality and the Qur’an’s egalitarian principles, while others rely on classical jurisprudence and social norms to support differentiated roles. In bioethics, principles such as the preservation of life and the objectives of Sharia (maqasid) guide Islamic responses to abortion, euthanasia, assisted conception and organ donation. There is no single view; rulings are shaped by schools of law, medical necessity, intention and societal context. Contemporary legal and ethical controversies also touch on freedom of belief, human rights, the role of religion in state law, and the challenge of maintaining religious identity in secular, multicultural societies. For examinations, present a balanced account that recognises diversity of opinion, illustrates reasoning with examples (such as differing rulings on assisted reproductive technologies), and evaluates how ethical principles are applied in practice.

## Exam technique
When answering A‑level questions on Islam, begin by setting precise definitions and contextualising your answer: explain terms like Tawhid, Sunnah, Hadith, Hijra or Sharia where relevant. For AO1 responses, show knowledge of core facts and develop explanation: for example, when asked about the Qur’an’s compilation, outline the process from revelation to standardisation and contrast Meccan and Medinan material. For AO2 and synoptic questions, move beyond description to analysis and evaluation. Compare differing interpretations and schools, weigh strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and draw on other aspects of human experience such as social, political or ethical implications. Use textual examples and named practices to support claims, but avoid overreliance on unsupported generalisations. For synoptic questions, explicitly link the required theme to at least one other unit of study or to wider contemporary issues; this could mean comparing Islamic authority structures with Christian models of authority, or relating ideas about conscience to global ethics debates. Structure essays with a clear introduction that outlines your approach, logical paragraphs that develop a line of argument, and a concise conclusion that judges the issue in balance. Write clearly, use appropriate technical vocabulary, and keep an eye on timing: practice writing full answers under timed conditions to ensure you can develop analysis without sacrificing depth.
