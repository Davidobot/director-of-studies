# Cold War flashpoints and proxy wars (Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Afghanistan) (GCSE History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Introduction: why these flashpoints matter
The Cold War was not a single, continuous fight between the United States and the Soviet Union on a single battlefield; it was a global struggle of influence and ideology. Flashpoints and proxy wars were the most dangerous and visible expressions of this struggle. Rather than fighting each other directly, the superpowers supported local governments, insurgents, armies and movements that reflected their rival visions of the post‑war world. Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and Afghanistan are four of the most important cases to study because each shows different features of Cold War conflict: the change from conventional war to guerrilla warfare, the risks of escalation between the superpowers, the role of regional powers, and the long-term human and political consequences of intervention. Understanding these cases helps explain how local conflicts shaped global relations, how ideology, strategy and domestic politics combined to produce prolonged violence, and how the Cold War ended up remaking the world map.

## What is a proxy war?
A proxy war is a conflict in which the main external powers do not confront each other directly but provide material support, weapons, training, money, political backing or even advisors to local actors who fight on their behalf. Proxy wars allowed the United States and the Soviet Union to pursue strategic objectives while avoiding direct nuclear confrontation. They also reflected a competition for influence: winning a government or movement could shift the balance of power and send a message to allies and neutrals. Proxy wars ranged from open conventional battles to long-term insurgencies. The style of fighting often depended on local conditions: terrain, popular support, the strength of governments and the organisational capacity of insurgent groups. For historians and students, proxy wars are useful for examining cause and consequence, continuity and change, and the limits of superpower control over events on the ground.

## Korea, 1950–1953: conventional war on a divided peninsula
The Korean War began in June 1950 when North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel and invaded the South. Korea had been divided after World War II into Soviet-backed North Korea and American-backed South Korea. The invasion triggered a swift response from the United Nations, led by the United States, which saw the attack as part of Soviet expansionism. Early North Korean successes were reversed after a daring amphibious landing at Inchon, but when UN forces approached the Chinese border, China intervened with large numbers of troops. The result was a brutal, conventional war that settled into a bloody stalemate. Armistice negotiations eventually produced a ceasefire in July 1953, restoring the division near the 38th parallel but leaving Korea technically still at war because no peace treaty was signed.

Korea matters because it was the first major armed conflict of the Cold War and because it demonstrated how local actors, regional powers and the superpowers became entangled. The involvement of China showed that the Soviet Union could provoke allied responses without firing its own troops, while the United States learned that limited objectives could still result in massive and costly commitments. The war also influenced domestic politics in the United States, contributing to a hardening of Cold War policies and increased defence spending.

## Vietnam, 1950s–1975: guerrilla war, escalation and limits of superpower power
Vietnam’s conflict stretches from anti-colonial struggle to a Cold War proxy war. After Japanese occupation in World War II, Vietnamese nationalists under Ho Chi Minh fought the French and won at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. The Geneva Accords divided Vietnam into a communist North and a non-communist South, but that division set the stage for renewed conflict as the North supported a communist insurgency, the Viet Cong, in the South. American involvement grew from financial and advisory support in the 1950s to large-scale military deployment from 1965. The United States committed to preventing the spread of communism in Southeast Asia and pursued a strategy of attrition, using superior firepower, bombing campaigns and large ground forces.

Vietnam exposed the limits of conventional military power against guerrilla warfare, the importance of political legitimacy, and the domestic political constraints on intervention. Key moments such as the Tet Offensive in 1968 undermined American confidence and public support despite being a military setback for North Vietnam; the offensive showed that the insurgency could strike widely and persist. Negotiations and the gradual US withdrawal culminated in the Paris Peace Accords of 1973, but the fall of Saigon in 1975 completed the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule. The war left deep human, social and political scars, reshaped US foreign policy debates about intervention and highlights how local resilience and asymmetric tactics can defeat larger powers.

## Cuba and the Missile Crisis, 1959–1962: how close to nuclear war?
Cuba provides a dramatic example of how a small state could become a major Cold War flashpoint. Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution transformed Cuba into an anti‑American, revolutionary state that welcomed Soviet support. Tensions rose after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, when US-backed exiles attempted to overthrow Castro and the US government’s involvement became apparent. The most dangerous episode was the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev secretly placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. Discovery of those missiles by US reconnaissance led to the closest the world ever came to nuclear war: President Kennedy imposed a naval “quarantine” and demanded the missiles’ removal.

The crisis was resolved by a combination of firm public pressure and secret negotiation. The Soviets agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a US public pledge not to invade Cuba and a secret commitment to remove US missiles from Turkey at a later date. The Cuban Missile Crisis had several lasting consequences: it demonstrated the value of careful, controlled diplomacy in a nuclear age; it led to new communications channels between Washington and Moscow, including the hotline; and it influenced future Cold War confrontations by underscoring the risks of direct superpower escalation. For students, Cuba is a clear case of brinkmanship and the role of leadership, miscalculation and bargaining in international crises.

## Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, 1979–1989: a long, costly occupation and its aftermath
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, aimed at supporting a faltering communist government against Islamist and tribal insurgents, turned into a decade-long quagmire. The Soviet Union expected a quick stabilisation, but the geography, local resistance and international reaction made the war protracted and costly. The Afghan mujahideen received substantial support from the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which supplied weapons, training and funds. The conflict drained Soviet resources, generated heavy casualties, displaced millions of civilians and increased international isolation for Moscow.

The Soviet–Afghan War is often seen as a factor in the weakening of the Soviet Union and the changing international balance that led to the end of the Cold War. It also had unintended longer-term consequences for the region. The networks and weapons used in the resistance, together with the radicalising effects of prolonged conflict, contributed to the rise of militant Islamist groups, eventually including the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and reshaped regional politics. For the Cold War, Afghanistan showed that superpower intervention could produce long-term instability beyond the immediate strategic objective, and it illustrated the limits of military power in hostile terrain against popular resistance.

## Comparisons and wider consequences: reading the patterns
Looking across these four cases reveals common themes and important differences. All four show the centrality of ideology and security concerns in superpower decision-making, but the local context often determined outcomes. Korea and Cuba involved direct military crises in which decisions by leaders and alliances mattered most; Vietnam and Afghanistan were prolonged insurgencies where guerrilla tactics, local support and external funding determined endurance. The role of other regional actors was crucial: China’s entry into Korea, North Vietnamese resilience and Hanoi’s links with both China and the Soviet Union, Cuba’s strategic position in the Caribbean, and Pakistan’s role in supporting anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan each shaped the course of events. In terms of consequences, these flashpoints influenced global diplomacy, defence policy and domestic politics in the superpowers and in the countries where wars were fought. They also changed the moral and political language of the era, feeding debates about intervention, national self-determination and human cost. For exam study, these patterns help with comparisons, judgements about significance and tracing cause-and-effect over time.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Cold War flashpoints and proxy wars, show clear knowledge of dates, key events and main actors, but always connect facts to the question. For “describe” and “explain” questions, structure answers so that each paragraph focuses on one clear point supported by specific evidence; for example, when explaining US escalation in Vietnam, link domestic politics, the domino theory and military events such as Gulf of Tonkin. For “how far” or “assess” questions, set out the strongest supporting point, a counter‑argument and then a judgement that weighs both perspectives; use phrases that signal evaluation, such as “this was important because,” and “however.” When sources are provided, consider provenance: who produced the source, when and why, and how that affects usefulness or reliability; use the source as evidence but bring in your own knowledge to judge its value. For essay questions worth many marks, plan a clear introduction that outlines your argument, develop balanced paragraphs with evidence and explanation, and conclude decisively, linking back to the question. Practice timing by doing past questions under timed conditions and annotate assessments to identify where you can add more precise facts or clearer analysis. Above all, aim to combine accurate factual recall with explanation that makes the significance of those facts explicit, using second‑order concepts like cause, consequence, continuity, change and significance to organise your response.
