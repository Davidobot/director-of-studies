# Northern Ireland: The Troubles and peace process (1965–98) (GCSE History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Background and the O’Neill years: reform, response and rising tensions
By the mid-1960s Northern Ireland was shaped by deep economic, social and political divisions between a Protestant, unionist majority and a Catholic, nationalist minority. Terence O’Neill became Prime Minister of Northern Ireland in 1963 and attempted to modernise the economy and to open a political dialogue with the Republic of Ireland. His policies aimed at attracting investment, improving housing and reducing sectarian barriers, and he even reached out to the Republic’s leaders in meetings that shocked many unionists. These initiatives had significance because they showed an official willingness to change how Northern Ireland was governed and to recognise that relations with the Republic mattered for the North’s future. However, O’Neill’s reforms produced mixed consequences: while some welcomed economic modernisation, hardline unionists and conservative figures such as Ian Paisley viewed his concessions as a threat. Understanding O’Neill’s period helps explain continuity and change in Northern Ireland: it was a time when existing practices were questioned but where entrenched identities and fears meant that reform produced resistance as often as consensus.

## The civil rights movement and the escalation of protest
Inspired in part by civil rights movements elsewhere and motivated by local grievances over housing, voting and policing, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) formed in the late 1960s to seek reforms through marches, petitions and demonstrations. The civil rights campaign highlighted real inequalities: gerrymandering in local government, discrimination in public housing allocation and complaints about the Royal Ulster Constabulary’s (RUC) treatment of Catholics. Early marches met with hostility and sometimes violence from loyalist counter-demonstrators and unsympathetic authorities. The development of more radical groups such as the student-led People’s Democracy reflected frustration at the slow pace of change. These protests mattered because they provoked strong and often heavy-handed security responses, which in turn increased communal tensions and created the conditions in which both republican and loyalist paramilitary activity expanded. In short, a movement that began as a non-violent demand for civil reform became a spark in a volatile political and social environment.

## 1969–72: breakdown, deployment, internment and the introduction of direct rule
The summer of 1969 saw a dramatic worsening of communal violence. Clashes between communities, large-scale rioting and intimidation led to the deployment of British troops to Northern Ireland, initially welcomed by some Catholic communities who felt unprotected. The index of escalation included the re-emergence of the Irish Republican Army in a more militant form and the growth of loyalist paramilitary groups such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and later the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). The introduction of internment without trial in 1971, intended to control the IRA, had the effect of detaining many nationalists while failing to capture key militant leaders; it fuelled anger and increased support for armed resistance. The events of Bloody Sunday in Derry on 30 January 1972, when a British Army operation resulted in civilians being shot during a protest march, had immediate and long-term consequences. The killings deepened nationalist distrust of the security forces, provoked international condemnation, and helped boost IRA recruitment. By March 1972 Stormont was suspended and direct rule from Westminster was introduced, a watershed moment with significant consequences for Northern Ireland’s governance and its relationship with Britain.

## Paramilitaries, strategy and the politics of violence: hunger strikes and electoralism
The Troubles involved a range of paramilitary organisations on both sides, each with different aims and tactics. The Provisional IRA conducted a sustained armed campaign aimed at ending British rule, while Republican strategy evolved over time from purely military action to a combination of political engagement. A crucial turning point was the hunger strikes of 1980 and 1981, the latter including the death of Bobby Sands, who was elected to the British Parliament while on strike. Sands’s election revealed how political and symbolic action could be linked to armed struggle and shifted thinking within republicans about the utility of electoral politics. Sinn Féin gradually adopted a dual strategy—continuing to support republican aims while contesting elections and winning seats—so that by the late 1980s and 1990s it had become a significant political actor. Loyalist paramilitaries, although often less centrally organised, used violence to resist perceived threats to the union and sometimes sought to influence politics through intimidation and strikes. Recognising these changing strategies is vital for understanding how armed conflict and political negotiation became intertwined.

## Attempts at political settlement: Sunningdale, the Ulster Workers’ Council and the limits of compromise (1973–74)
The early 1970s saw the first major attempt to restore devolved government: the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973 proposed a power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland alongside a cross-border Council of Ireland intended to improve north–south relations. This arrangement attempted to reconcile unionist and nationalist demands by sharing government and recognising links with the Republic. The significance of Sunningdale lay in its framing of a political solution that included both communities and neighbours. However, unionist opponents claimed the Council of Ireland endangered Northern Ireland’s constitutional position. The Ulster Workers’ Council strike of May 1974, supported by loyalist groups and many unionist workers, paralysed electricity, transport and everyday life and forced the collapse of the power-sharing Executive. The failure of this settlement illustrates the consequence of political action when it lacks broad community consent and shows how extra-parliamentary pressure can undermine formal agreements.

## From Anglo-Irish Agreement to the Downing Street Declaration: building international and cross-community momentum (1985–93)
The long 1980s were shaped by a combination of continuing violence and political realignments. The 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed by Margaret Thatcher and Garret FitzGerald, recognised that the Republic of Ireland had a consultative role in Northern Irish affairs and created structures for cooperation. For nationalists this was a step towards acknowledging their concerns; for many unionists it was seen as a betrayal. The 1980s also saw the increasing importance of political dialogue across community lines. The Hume–Adams contacts in the late 1980s and early 1990s—between John Hume of the SDLP and Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin—helped create channels for negotiation and prepared the ground for more formal talks. The Downing Street Declaration of December 1993, agreed by John Major and Albert Reynolds, was significant because it affirmed the principle of consent—Northern Ireland’s status could only change with the majority’s agreement—while recognising the legitimacy of both nationalist aspirations and unionist attachments. It opened a pathway for republicans to engage in talks and helped pave the way for the ceasefires of the 1990s.

## The Good Friday Agreement, 1998: terms, referendums and lasting consequences
The peace process culminated in the Good Friday Agreement (also called the Belfast Agreement) of April 1998, following inclusive talks involving the British and Irish governments and the main Northern Irish parties. The Agreement established a framework for devolved, power-sharing government, created the North–South Ministerial Council to foster cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and set out principles for human rights, policing reform and decommissioning of weapons. It also included provisions on prisoner release and recognised both British and Irish identities, making consent the cornerstone of any constitutional change. The Agreement was endorsed by referendums held in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in May 1998, which gave it democratic legitimacy. International actors played important roles: the United States, notably through Senator George Mitchell as chair, provided mediation and credibility. The Agreement’s significance is profound: it transformed political structures, reduced large-scale violence and opened political space for previously excluded actors. Its consequences included complex and often difficult implementation processes, tensions over decommissioning and policing, and the ongoing task of reconciliation. Yet its success is measured by the fact that it created a durable framework within which political disputes are increasingly resolved by negotiation rather than violence.

## Interpreting the Troubles: causes, consequences and contested memories
Studying the Troubles requires attention to multiple causes and to how different communities remember events. Causes included socio-economic inequalities, discriminatory practices in housing and voting, the legacy of partition and identity politics, and immediate triggers such as policing methods and controversial policies like internment. Consequences were severe and wide-ranging: thousands killed and injured, deep social trauma, economic costs, patterns of segregation and prolonged distrust between communities. Interpretations vary. Unionist narratives often stress the need for security and the defence of the union, while nationalist accounts emphasise discrimination and the right to self-determination. Historians and participants differ on the relative weight of structural causes versus individual agency, or on whether British policy was reactive or at times counter-productive. For classroom study, analysing contemporary sources—newspaper reports, government statements, personal testimonies—and later interpretations helps students practise AO3 and AO4 skills by evaluating provenance, purpose and perspective. Comparing and contrasting sources encourages an understanding of how history is constructed and why debates continue about responsibility and commemoration.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on the Troubles and the peace process, begin by making a clear plan that sets out the argument and the main points you will use as evidence. For shorter questions, ensure your answer directly addresses the focus—use dates, names and events to show knowledge and relevance. For source-based questions, identify the source’s origin, purpose and tone before using it as evidence; ask what the source tells you and what it leaves out, and cross-check it against your contextual knowledge. In essays, structure your response into paragraphs that each make a clear point, support that point with specific factual detail (for example, reference Sunningdale, Bloody Sunday, the hunger strikes or the Good Friday Agreement), and explain how the evidence supports your overall judgement. Make use of second-order historical concepts such as cause, consequence, continuity and change, and significance: for instance, explain not only what internment was but why it mattered for support for the IRA and for community relations. When evaluating interpretations, consider who produced them and why, and balance different viewpoints before reaching a reasoned conclusion. Manage your time so that you leave a few minutes at the end to check spelling, clarity and the coherence of your argument; a short concluding paragraph that sums up your main judgement will strengthen your answer. Finally, practice with past papers and mark schemes to become familiar with the style of questions and the level of detail required for higher grades.
