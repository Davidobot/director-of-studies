# The Cold War: origins and end (1945–91) (GCSE History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## The collapse of the wartime alliance and the origins of tension, 1945
The Second World War had forced the Soviet Union and the United States to cooperate against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, but by 1945 deep differences were already apparent. At Yalta and Potsdam the leaders agreed on the broad shape of post‑war Europe but disagreed about details such as how much freedom Poland and other liberated states should have. The Soviet Union insisted on secure borders and friendly governments as a buffer against future invasion; the United States and Britain emphasised free elections and liberal democracies. The replacement of Roosevelt by Truman, the revelation that the USA had developed the atomic bomb, and growing mutual suspicion hardened attitudes. Where wartime cooperation had been based on a shared enemy, the post‑war world revealed conflicting visions: Soviet communism and American capitalism and liberal democracy. These ideological differences, combined with security concerns and competition for influence, provide the clearest explanation for the Cold War’s origins.

## Superpower rivalry and early measures, 1945–49
Between 1945 and 1949 the rivalry became structured. The Soviet Union consolidated control over Eastern Europe by supporting Communist parties, controlling governments through political pressure and rigged elections, and creating institutions such as Cominform and Comecon to bind the region economically and politically. Western leaders responded to perceived Soviet expansionism with new policies. Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech in 1946 captured the sense of division. The Truman Doctrine of 1947 committed the United States to resist Soviet influence, first in Greece and Turkey and then more broadly; it introduced the idea of containment. The Marshall Plan, also 1947–48, used economic aid to rebuild Western European economies and tie them to the West. Tensions over Germany culminated in the Berlin Blockade of 1948–49, when the Soviet Union cut land access to West Berlin; the Western airlift supplied the city and the crisis helped to cement the division of Germany. By 1949 the Cold War had become institutionalised with the creation of NATO and the Soviet development of an atomic bomb, which ended America’s nuclear monopoly and intensified the arms race.

## Flashpoints in Europe: crisis, uprising and suppression
Europe produced recurring crises that shaped the Cold War’s character. In 1956 Hungary attempted to break from Soviet dominance; a popular uprising hoped for political reform and neutrality but was crushed when Soviet tanks entered Budapest. The invasion demonstrated that the USSR would use force to maintain its sphere of influence and showed the limits of Western power. Berlin remained a focal point of East–West tension through the 1950s and into 1961. The flow of refugees from East to West embarrassed the Eastern bloc and in 1961 the East German government, backed by Moscow, built the Berlin Wall, symbolising the Cold War’s human and ideological division. In 1968 the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia, an attempt to create “socialism with a human face,” ended with a Warsaw Pact invasion. The Brezhnev Doctrine that followed asserted the right of the Soviet Union to intervene when socialism was threatened in the Eastern bloc. Each of these episodes illustrates the interplay of local demands for reform with superpower strategy; they are important for understanding how the Cold War was experienced by ordinary people in Europe and why détente was always fragile.

## Cold War confrontations beyond Europe: Korea, Cuba and Vietnam
The Cold War was not confined to Europe. In Korea in 1950 a civil war became a major international conflict when North Korea, supported by the USSR and later China, invaded the South. The United States led a UN force to repel the invasion, turning Korea into the first “hot war” of the Cold War. The fighting ended in stalemate in 1953, leaving a divided peninsula and a militarised border that remains significant today. In 1962 the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world perilously close to nuclear war when Soviet missiles were placed in Cuba in response to American missiles in Turkey and to attempts to remove Fidel Castro. The tense thirteen days of negotiation ended with a Soviet withdrawal and secret US concessions, but the crisis highlighted the dangers of superpower confrontation and led to later efforts at arms control. In Southeast Asia, American involvement in Vietnam increased throughout the 1950s and 1960s as leaders feared the “domino” effect of communist expansion. Vietnam became a long, costly war that exposed limits to US power, provoked domestic opposition in the United States, and shaped the global perception of the Cold War’s human cost.

## Détente, the arms race and renewed confrontation, 1969–79
From the late 1960s to the mid‑1970s a phase known as détente reduced tensions through diplomacy, arms control agreements and increased contact. Summits and treaties such as SALT I aimed to slow the nuclear arms race and stabilise relations. The Helsinki Accords of 1975 recognised post‑war frontiers in Europe while also promoting human rights, a duality that would later support dissent inside the communist bloc. Yet détente did not eliminate rivalry. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 ended the era of thaw and triggered a period of renewed confrontation in the 1980s. The arms race intensified with new American strategic initiatives and a renewed emphasis on military strength on both sides. The 1970s and 1980s show how diplomatic progress could be fragile when strategic interests clashed.

## The end of the Cold War, 1985–91
The Cold War unwound in the late 1980s for reasons that combine Soviet internal reform, economic weakness, and changing international leadership. Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and introduced policies of perestroika (economic restructuring) and glasnost (openness). These reforms were intended to revive Soviet socialism but had the unintended effect of unleashing political forces that challenged single‑party rule. Gorbachev also signalled a willingness to reduce confrontation with the West and to limit the use of force in Eastern Europe. The United States under President Reagan first opposed Soviet power strongly but later engaged in negotiation; both leaders played roles in reaching arms control agreements and in reducing nuclear tensions. As communist regimes in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Romania collapsed during 1989, Gorbachev refused orders to intervene militarily. The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 became the defining image of the end of the Cold War. German reunification in 1990, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and the formal end of the Soviet Union in 1991 completed the transformation from a bipolar confrontation to a new international order. The end of the Cold War had vast consequences: it removed the immediate threat of superpower nuclear confrontation, reshaped alliances, and opened the way for political and economic change in Eastern Europe and beyond.

## Interpreting causes and consequences: key concepts for understanding the Cold War
To make sense of the Cold War it helps to use second‑order historical concepts such as cause, consequence, continuity and change, and significance. The immediate causes include wartime disagreements and security dilemmas; the long‑term causes involve ideological conflict and competing visions of post‑war order. Consequences were global and mixed: the division of Europe, the arms race and the spread of proxy wars had human, political and economic costs. Continuities include persistent rivalry between great powers and the centrality of military power; changes include the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the end of Soviet influence. When studying events such as the Berlin Blockade or the Cuban Missile Crisis, consider local details (leaders, dates, actions) together with broader patterns (escalation, diplomacy, deterrence). Using examples — for instance how the Marshall Plan linked economic aid to political aims, or how the Prague Spring revealed limits to Soviet tolerance of reform — helps to link specific events to these broader themes and to produce clear analytical answers.

## Exam technique
Answer examinations by combining accurate factual knowledge with clear analysis and evaluation. For questions that test AO1, make sure your answers recall key facts and explain who did what, where and when. For AO2, move beyond description: explain causes, effects and the importance of events, using terms such as continuity, change, cause and consequence. For source‑based questions (AO3), read the source carefully, use it as evidence but do not take it at face value; consider what the source shows, what it overlooks, who wrote it and why, and compare it with your own knowledge. For questions on interpretations (AO4), explain how and why historians or contemporaries might disagree, use specific evidence to support or challenge the interpretation, and reach a reasoned judgement. Always plan longer answers: start with a clear thesis or line of argument, organise paragraphs around single points with evidence and explanation, and finish with a conclusion that answers the question directly. Use dates and names to anchor your points, but avoid overloading with unconnected facts. Manage your time by allocating minutes according to mark values, leave time to check spelling and clarity, and practise writing under timed conditions. Finally, remember that quality of written communication is assessed: write legibly, use correct grammar and specialist vocabulary (for example containment, détente, satellite states, arms race), and make your arguments easy to follow. Regular revision of key events and practising past questions will build both confidence and the skills examiners look for.
