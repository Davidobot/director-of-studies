# The 'War on Terror': 9/11, Afghanistan and Iraq (2001–2003) (GCSE History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview and context
The period from September 2001 to 2003 marks a dramatic shift in international relations. The terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 brought the threat of transnational Islamist terrorism into the heart of the United States and prompted a sustained military and political response often described as the "War on Terror." This phrase covered a range of policies, from international military interventions to domestic security measures and intelligence operations. For students, it is important to see this era both as a set of immediate reactions to the 9/11 attacks and as the continuation of longer trends in geopolitics: the post-Cold War insecurity in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia, the proliferation of non-state violent actors, and the complicated relationships between regional powers, superpowers and local communities. Understanding the causes, the choices made by political leaders, and the short- and long-term consequences helps explain why the events of 2001–2003 had such lasting significance.

## Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and the Taliban
Al-Qaeda was a transnational network formed in the late 1980s by Osama bin Laden and others who had been involved in the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. Bin Laden’s group combined extremist ideology with a capability to plan and carry out attacks across borders. Its hostility to American military presence in the Middle East, to regimes it saw as corrupt or insufficiently Islamic, and to what it termed Western aggression, framed a campaign of attacks during the 1990s culminating in 9/11. At the same time, the Taliban, an Islamic militia movement that emerged in the chaotic aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, controlled much of Afghanistan by the late 1990s. The Taliban established strict social rules and provided sanctuary to Al-Qaeda leaders. This relationship was central to American policy after 9/11: the US demanded that the Taliban hand over bin Laden and close terrorist bases. The Taliban’s refusal, and the conviction among US policymakers that Al-Qaeda posed an imminent threat, became one of the key causes cited for military action in Afghanistan.

## The 9/11 attacks and the immediate US response
On 11 September 2001, hijacked airliners were used as weapons in coordinated attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, while a fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted. Nearly 3,000 people died and the scale of the violence shocked the world. The attacks reshaped US political priorities. President George W. Bush declared a campaign against terrorism and framed the response as a matter of national defence and moral clarity. Domestically, the United States passed measures to enhance security and intelligence-gathering, while internationally it sought to build a coalition to pursue Al-Qaeda and its supporters. NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time in its history, treating the attacks as an attack on the whole alliance. The decision to respond militarily was influenced by intelligence assessments, public pressure for decisive action, and the belief that removing Al-Qaeda’s safe havens would reduce the likelihood of further attacks.

## Invasion of Afghanistan, 2001
The invasion of Afghanistan, launched in October 2001 as Operation Enduring Freedom, had clear immediate objectives: to destroy Al-Qaeda’s infrastructure, capture or kill its leaders, and remove the Taliban from power so that it could no longer provide sanctuary. The campaign combined US air power, special forces, and support for the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. Within a few months major Taliban strongholds fell and a new interim Afghan administration under Hamid Karzai was established at the Bonn Conference in December 2001. Initially, these outcomes seemed to meet the aims of the coalition. However, the reality was more complicated. Many Al-Qaeda operatives, including senior figures, evaded capture and dispersed across the region. The Taliban was not entirely defeated; it regrouped and eventually re-emerged as an insurgency. The international community faced the difficult tasks of state-building, establishing security, and reconstructing institutions in a deeply divided society. For students it is useful to distinguish between the immediate military success of dislodging the Taliban from Kabul and the longer-term challenges of stabilising Afghanistan and preventing a return to extremist control.

## The invasion of Iraq, 2003
The decision to invade Iraq in March 2003 was one of the most controversial actions in this period. The governments of the United States and the United Kingdom led a coalition that argued Iraq posed a threat because of its alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes, claimed links to terrorist groups, and the need to remove Saddam Hussein’s regime. These claims were presented to international audiences, most notably in a high-profile address to the United Nations. In the opening phase, the campaign—often described as "shock and awe" because of its intense aerial bombardment—rapidly toppled Saddam Hussein’s government. Baghdad fell in April 2003 and Saddam was captured by US forces in December of that year. But the justification for the invasion soon came under intense scrutiny. UN inspectors and later inquiries found that Iraq did not possess active WMD programmes at the time of the invasion. The asserted operational links between Saddam’s regime and Al-Qaeda also proved to be far less clear and much more limited than had been suggested by some policymakers. These revelations fuelled debates about the legality and wisdom of the invasion, and they shaped public opinion about the reliability of intelligence and the motives of coalition governments.

## Consequences and controversies
The consequences of the interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq were wide-ranging and often unexpected. In Afghanistan, initial military success did not translate into long-term stability; the Taliban persisted and the country became the site of a protracted insurgency that would last for many years. In Iraq, the removal of Saddam created a power vacuum that contributed to sectarian violence, the rise of an organised insurgency and the spread of extremist groups. The failure to find WMDs undermined the credibility of intelligence services and governments, and prompted inquiries and political fallout in the US and UK. Legal scholars, diplomats and many members of the international community debated whether the Iraq invasion complied with international law, given that the UN Security Council did not explicitly authorise the use of force in 2003. The human cost was enormous: thousands of military personnel and large numbers of civilians were killed or wounded, and millions were displaced, producing refugee and humanitarian crises. These outcomes also had financial and political costs, shaping domestic politics, contributing to public scepticism about intervention, and influencing the foreign policies of many states.

## Wider effects on international relations and society
Beyond military campaigns, the "War on Terror" changed how states thought about security, intelligence and civil liberties. The United States and other governments introduced stronger counter-terrorism legislation, new intelligence-sharing arrangements, and expanded surveillance capabilities. Facilities such as the detention centre at Guantánamo Bay, extraordinary rendition and enhanced interrogation techniques sparked controversy over human rights and the rule of law. NATO’s invocation of Article 5 after 9/11 marked a significant moment in alliance politics, bringing allies into Afghanistan and reshaping the nature of collective defence. The campaigns also affected perceptions of the United States and its allies in many parts of the world, sometimes increasing anti-Western sentiment and complicating diplomatic relationships. Over the longer term, the instability unleashed in Iraq contributed to wider regional turmoil and helped create conditions in which new extremist groups could grow. For classroom discussion, it is important to balance the stated aims of counter-terrorism—protecting populations and dismantling terrorist networks—against the unintended consequences, such as civilian suffering, state failure and the erosion of trust in institutions.

## Teaching and interpretation: sources, causes and significance
When studying this period it helps to approach evidence and interpretations with care. Contemporary sources, such as government statements, UN reports and media coverage, reveal how events were presented at the time, but they often reflect political objectives and limited information. Later interpretations, including official inquiries and scholarly research, provide more critical evaluations, for example on the quality of intelligence about Iraq’s WMDs or the effectiveness of nation-building in Afghanistan. Use sources to test cause-and-effect claims: compare government justifications with the findings of independent inquiries and think about why interpretations differ. Consider short-term causes, such as the Taliban’s refusal to hand over bin Laden, alongside longer-term causes, such as regional instability, which created the conditions in which extremist groups could operate. Assess the significance of events by asking what changed as a result of them: did policies reduce the terrorist threat, alter international norms, or transform domestic politics? These questions link directly to the second-order historical concepts you will be assessed on: cause and consequence, continuity and change, and significance.

## Exam technique
To do well in exam questions on the "War on Terror" you should combine clear factual knowledge with analysis and evaluation. For short answer questions, be precise and give dates, names and concise explanations. For source questions, start by identifying what the source shows and whose perspective it represents, then use your own knowledge to confirm, challenge or widen the source’s view. When asked to explain causes or consequences, structure your answer with an introduction that sets out the main points, followed by paragraphs that examine each reason in turn and explain its impact, and finish with a brief conclusion that judges which factor was most important. For essays, plan before you write: decide your overall argument, order your points logically, and use specific evidence—events, dates, quotations from speeches, outcomes of inquiries—to support each claim. When evaluating interpretations, consider the author’s purpose, the time at which the interpretation was written and the evidence available to them. Time management is crucial: spend the first few minutes reading the question and planning, allocate time in proportion to the marks available, and leave a few minutes to check your work. Finally, link your answers to the assessment objectives by demonstrating accurate knowledge (AO1), analysing causes and consequences (AO2), using sources where required (AO3), and considering differing interpretations or the value of evidence when asked (AO4).
