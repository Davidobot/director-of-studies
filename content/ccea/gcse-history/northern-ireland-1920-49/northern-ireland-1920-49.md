# Northern Ireland and neighbours, 1920–49 (GCSE History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: themes and timeframe
This topic covers the changing political, social and diplomatic relationships between Northern Ireland, the Irish state(s) and Britain in the period from the partition of Ireland after the First World War to the early post‑Second World War settlement. Key themes are state‑building and identity after 1920, the breakdown and repair of relations between Dublin and London during the 1920s and 1930s, the pressures of war and neutrality in the 1940s, and the reshaping of relationships after 1945 as welfare, constitutional change and the declaration of a republic all affected how the neighbours related to one another. Throughout, keep in mind the changing priorities of governments (security, sovereignty, economy) and public opinion in different communities, because these explain why policies changed and why tensions rose or fell.

## Partition and the immediate aftermath, 1920–25
The Government of Ireland Act 1920 created Northern Ireland as a separate jurisdiction with its own parliament at Stormont while providing for two self‑governing entities on the island. Unionists in the north generally welcomed partition because it preserved their majority rule locally and their link with Britain. Nationalists and republicans in the south rejected it; the Anglo‑Irish Treaty of 1921 then established the Irish Free State as a dominion, a compromise that led to civil war in Ireland and lingering resentment in the north. The Boundary Commission of 1924–25, intended to redraw the border, produced little change and was effectively shelved, leaving partition intact. The immediate decades after 1920 were therefore about consolidating new states: building Stormont’s institutions and public services in Northern Ireland, and creating the Free State’s government while dealing with the political and economic costs of separation.

Understanding significance here means recognising continuity and change: partition was a decisive and long‑lasting change in island governance, but many social and economic links continued across the border and with Britain. Reactions to partition were not uniform: Unionists tended to emphasise security and loyalty to Britain, while many nationalists continued to seek reunification by political or extra‑legal means.

## From Irish Free State to Éire and the Economic War, 1932–38
Éamon de Valera’s rise to power in the 1930s marked an assertive constitutional shift. De Valera worked to dismantle aspects of the Anglo‑Irish Treaty that he and his supporters saw as compromising sovereignty. The 1937 Constitution created the new name Éire for the state and set out an increasingly independent Irish polity. A sharp dispute over land annuities and other financial issues led to the Economic War with Britain (roughly 1932–38), during which tariffs and counter‑tariffs damaged trade and hurt farmers and exporters in both the Free State and Britain. The dispute mattered for relations with Northern Ireland because it interrupted economic ties and highlighted competing claims about responsibility and authority on the island.

The Economic War ended in 1938 with the Anglo‑Irish Agreements, negotiated in a context of growing international tension. One important element of the 1938 settlement was the return to Britain of the “Treaty ports” that had remained under British control since 1922; this compromise improved defence cooperation and signalled a pragmatic rapprochement. For students, it’s useful to link cause and consequence: economic pressure and diplomatic negotiation produced a settlement that altered military geography and eased one source of friction, but did not resolve constitutional disagreement about partition.

## Northern Ireland and society between the wars
While much attention is rightly paid to high politics and Anglo‑Irish diplomacy, it helps to consider how people in Northern Ireland experienced these years. Stormont governments were dominated by unionist parties, which shaped social policy, housing and education in ways that reinforced communal divisions. Economic life in the north relied heavily on industry—shipyards, linen, and engineering—and this produced both growth and vulnerability when world markets shifted. The social consequences of poverty and poor housing were significant, and these weaknesses were exposed during the wartime bombing of Belfast. Understanding local perspectives—how ordinary Protestant and Catholic communities saw Stormont’s legitimacy, how economic hardship could intensify political resentment—deepens explanations about why relations across the border and with London remained fraught.

## World War II: war, contribution and the Belfast Blitz
The outbreak of the Second World War tested relations between Northern Ireland, Éire, and Britain. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, mobilised for war. Its shipyards, aircraft repair facilities and ports had strategic importance, and many Northern Irish men served in the British forces. The question of conscription was politically explosive; Stormont resisted full imposition of conscription in Northern Ireland because of fears it would inflame nationalist opinion and reduce support for the unionist government. Economically, wartime demand brought jobs, but also shortages and the strains of rationing.

Belfast suffered severe Luftwaffe raids in April and May 1941, known as the Belfast Blitz. The raids caused large numbers of civilian casualties, widespread damage and highlighted deficiencies in housing and civil defence. The Blitz had social as well as political effects: it exposed underlying poverty and made wartime hardship visible to politicians and the public.

In contrast, Éire pursued a policy of neutrality under de Valera. The north’s active role in the war and the south’s neutrality created diplomatic friction but also zones of covert cooperation. For example, shared concerns about German activity and geography brought practical communications and intelligence discussions behind the scenes. The Belfast raids and the strategic activities in the Atlantic and airspace underlined that the island’s security could not be neatly separated into north and south.

## Éire’s neutrality: reasons, practice and reactions
Éire’s neutrality had multiple roots: the legacy of British rule and civil war made many Irish leaders wary of entangling alliances; strategic concerns and a desire for full sovereignty shaped policy; and domestic opinion often supported staying out of another European conflict. De Valera’s policy of “benevolent neutrality” meant that while the state formally stayed neutral, there were practical concessions to the Allies at times—weather reports, limited intelligence sharing, and humanitarian gestures.

Neutrality affected relations in several ways. Britain and Northern Ireland sometimes resented what they viewed as unequal treatment, especially early in the war when access to ports and bases mattered. At the same time, attempts by Britain to persuade Éire to enter the war were met with public caution in the south and suspicion in the north. The Irish government’s emergency measures, including banning the IRA during wartime and controlling civil liberties, showed that neutrality did not mean passivity. Public reactions across communities varied: some in Éire were proud of neutrality as independence, others feared the risks; in Northern Ireland, many felt exposed by the south’s stance and wanted stronger cooperation in defence.

When discussing the impact of neutrality, consider both immediate consequences—diplomatic friction, military positioning—and longer‑term political symbolism: Éire’s neutrality reinforced its separate identity from Britain and shaped post‑war constitutional debates.

## Post‑war changes and the road to the Republic, 1945–49
The end of the war brought new political dynamics. The election of a Labour government in Britain in 1945 led to the creation of the modern Welfare State: family allowances, national insurance, national assistance and, crucially, the National Health Service in 1948. Northern Ireland adopted some welfare measures at Stormont but did so unevenly, because of differing political priorities and local controversies. The 1947 (Northern Ireland) Education Act addressed schooling and had social consequences too, affecting community relations and opportunities.

Meanwhile in Éire, post‑war governments consolidated international position and argued for full republican status. The Declaration of the Republic in 1949 removed the last vestiges of connection with the British Crown. This change was formalised by the Republic of Ireland Act coming into force in 1949, and Britain responded with the Ireland Act 1949, which guaranteed that Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom unless Stormont's parliament decided otherwise and which recognised the new Irish state. The years around 1949 also saw political agitation such as the Anti‑Partition League and the so‑called “chapel‑gate” election campaigning that highlighted the continued salience of partition in communal politics.

The declaration of the Republic and the British legal response had both symbolic and practical effects: they ended ambiguity about the south’s constitutional position, reassured unionists about Northern Ireland’s status, and hardened positions in some nationalist circles. For relations between the neighbours, the period closed one chapter of negotiation and opened another, in which the political arrangements of the 1920s were now being accepted legally by all sides even as dissatisfaction and identity questions remained unresolved.

## Interpreting significance: continuity and change
Across the 1920–49 period, there are clear continuities—partition survived, and the north remained committed politically to the UK—alongside important changes, such as Éire’s gradual assertion of constitutional independence, wartime pressures that tested loyalties and infrastructures, and post‑war social reform that reshaped expectations about state responsibilities. When explaining cause and consequence, relate specific events (for example, the Economic War, the 1938 agreements, the Belfast Blitz, the Republic declaration) to wider trends: economic vulnerability, the politics of identity, and the impact of international crises. Use examples—trade figures, port transfers, descriptions of the Blitz, the text and consequences of the Ireland Act—to show how decisions had practical effects for people’s lives.

## Exam technique
When answering source questions, first summarise what the source says in your own words, then comment on its origin, purpose and tone. Ask who produced it, when and why: provenance helps you explain what the source might emphasise or omit. Use the source as evidence but corroborate it with contextual knowledge: link details to events such as the Economic War, the Belfast Blitz, or the declaration of the Republic. For usefulness questions, discuss both content and limitations—does the source give direct facts, or is it an opinion piece, propaganda or a private letter? For evaluating multiple sources, compare what they agree on and where they differ, and consider different perspectives (British, Northern Irish Unionist, southern nationalist).

For longer essays, begin with a clear line of argument that directly answers the question and signals the second‑order concepts you will use (cause, consequence, continuity, change, significance). Structure paragraphs around distinct points: start with a topic sentence, provide specific evidence (dates, names, policies), explain how the evidence supports your argument, and link back to the question. Use short, accurate factual detail to support claims—mention the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the Anglo‑Irish Treaty, the 1938 agreements, the Belfast Blitz, the Republic declaration and the Ireland Act when relevant. Remember to weigh competing factors rather than listing events: explain why one cause or consequence was more important than another.

Manage your time: read the paper carefully, allocate time according to marks, and leave a few minutes to check spelling and clarity. In source‑based answers, integrate knowledge smoothly with the source rather than treating them as separate sections. Finally, practise past‑style questions under timed conditions and get feedback so you can refine how you plan essays, use evidence and reach balanced conclusions.
