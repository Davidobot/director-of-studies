# Life in the USA, 1920–33 (GCSE History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: a decade of contrast
The period 1920–33 in the United States is often described in contrasting terms: the “Roaring Twenties” evokes images of economic prosperity, new consumer lifestyles and bold cultural change, while the decade ends with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that exposed deep economic weaknesses and caused widespread hardship. Politically, the decade was dominated by Republican administrations that favoured business-friendly policies, low taxes and limited federal intervention. Socially, the era saw both modernising trends—mass entertainment, the new visibility of women in public life and a flourishing of African American culture in the North—and reactionary forces, such as the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, the tightening of immigration laws and the persistence of Jim Crow segregation in the South. Understanding this period means tracing how technological change, economic policy and cultural shifts combined to reshape American life, and how long-standing inequalities and structural problems left the economy vulnerable to collapse.

## Politics and economic policy: Republican dominance and laissez-faire
From Warren G. Harding through Calvin Coolidge to Herbert Hoover, Republican presidents set the tone of national policy. They promoted pro-business policies, believing that a minimal role for government would encourage growth. Tax cuts for the wealthy, protective tariffs to shelter domestic industry and credit expansion were core features of the decade. The administrations encouraged technological innovation and mass production, especially in industry and in automobile manufacturing, which in turn supported other sectors such as oil, rubber and road construction. At the same time, federal regulation was limited: antitrust enforcement weakened, and aid to struggling sectors was generally left to local governments, private charity or voluntary business schemes. This political approach helped fuel rapid growth for some, but left farmers, industrial workers in declining sectors and many minority communities exposed to market fluctuations and regional downturns. The long-term effect was an economy that looked robust on the surface but depended on credit, speculative investment and unequal income distribution.

## The Roaring Twenties: mass production, consumerism and new culture
Technological advances and new production methods transformed everyday life. Henry Ford’s refinement of the assembly line greatly reduced the cost of cars, making them affordable to millions and reshaping the landscape of American living with suburbanisation, new patterns of work and leisure, and growth in associated industries. Mass marketing and hire-purchase credit spread consumer goods—radios, household appliances and clothing—creating a culture of consumption. Entertainment changed profoundly. Jazz music, born from African American communities, became a national phenomenon, radio connected listeners across the country, and Hollywood films created celebrity culture and a common set of references for Americans of different regions. Sport became a mass spectacle, symbolised by figures like boxers and baseball stars who attracted national attention. For many urban middle-class Americans these developments signalled freedom, modernity and opportunity; for others, especially in rural areas, they represented moral decline and threatened traditional values.

## Social change and persistent inequalities: women, African Americans, immigrants and Native Americans
Women made important advances in the 1920s. Political emancipation through the 19th Amendment gave women the vote, and the image of the “flapper” symbolised new attitudes to fashion, leisure and independence for some middle-class women. Increasing numbers of women entered the workforce, though many remained concentrated in low-paid, gender-segregated jobs and many rural or religious communities continued to expect traditional roles. For African Americans the decade offered both hope and continued oppression. The Great Migration moved large numbers of Black Americans from the rural South to northern cities in search of work and greater social freedom, stimulating a cultural renaissance especially in Harlem, where literature, music and intellectual life thrived. Yet Jim Crow segregation remained entrenched in the South, lynching and racial violence persisted, and discrimination in housing, employment and the legal system limited opportunities. Immigrants faced growing hostility after the First World War. The Red Scare, the Palmer Raids and high-profile cases such as Sacco and Vanzetti heightened fears of radicalism and foreign influence, while successive immigration laws in the early 1920s imposed strict national quotas that sharply reduced entries from southern and eastern Europe. Native Americans continued to suffer the effects of allotment policies and forced assimilation through boarding schools, which undermined traditional societies and cultures. In short, the social map of the 1920s combined striking cultural innovation with deep and often violent social divisions.

## Prohibition, organised crime and cultural conflict
Prohibition, introduced nationwide with the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act, aimed to eliminate alcohol-related social problems but had many unintended consequences. While support for Prohibition came from temperance movements and religious groups, enforcement proved difficult across a large and diverse nation. Illegal production and distribution of alcohol became a lucrative business for organised crime networks. Figures such as Al Capone and violent incidents like the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre became publicised examples of how Prohibition fuelled gang activity, corruption and lawlessness. Prohibition also heightened the cultural divide between modern, urban lifestyles that often rejected the ban and more conservative, rural regions that sought to preserve it. By the end of the 1920s the difficulties of enforcement, rising organised crime and shifting public opinion made Prohibition increasingly controversial.

## The Wall Street Crash and the economic collapse
Beneath the surface prosperity of the 1920s sat a number of structural problems: an unequal distribution of wealth left a large portion of the population with limited purchasing power; many industries produced more goods than consumers could buy; agriculture had faced a long period of decline with falling prices and mounting debts; and speculative investment became widespread. Stock market speculation, fuelled by buying on margin and an overconfident belief in endless growth, inflated asset prices. When confidence faltered in late 1929, a wave of selling caused stock prices to collapse in October, culminating in the Wall Street Crash. The Crash did not by itself cause every aspect of the subsequent depression, but it destroyed paper wealth, undermined banks and investor confidence, and triggered a chain of events that led to business failures, mass unemployment and a collapse in global trade. International factors such as war debts and protectionist tariffs also deepened the downturn, reducing demand for American exports and prompting retaliatory measures abroad.

## The Great Depression, Hoover’s response and political consequences
The economic crisis of 1929 rapidly developed into the Great Depression. Factories closed, unemployment soared, and many families lost their savings and homes. Farmers faced catastrophic price falls and, in some regions like the Great Plains, ecological disaster compounded economic woes. The Dust Bowl—a combination of drought, poor farming practices and high winds—devastated crops and forced thousands of families to migrate west in search of work, famously forming the “Okie” migration to California. President Herbert Hoover, shaped by beliefs in voluntarism, individualism and limited government intervention, initially resisted large-scale federal relief. His policies emphasised voluntary cooperation by businesses, local relief efforts and measures such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation which lent to banks and businesses in 1932. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, intended to protect industry, worsened international trade relations and deepened the global slump. High-profile events such as the Bonus Army march of 1932, when protesting veterans were forcibly removed from encampments in Washington, damaged Hoover’s reputation and highlighted the human cost of the crisis. By the 1932 presidential election, public demand for more active government solutions helped elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, who promised a New Deal of federal programmes and reforms. Historians debate the effectiveness of Hoover’s measures: some argue he lacked the political mandate and constitutional tools for more radical action, while others criticise his reliance on local relief and fiscal conservatism as inadequate in the face of a systemic collapse.

## Cultural responses and legacy
Despite the economic collapse, the 1920s and early 1930s left lasting cultural legacies. Jazz, cinema and radio reshaped American identity and created shared cultural experiences. The Harlem Renaissance produced writers and artists whose work questioned racial inequality and influenced later civil rights movements. The decade’s technological transformations, particularly the automobile and radio, permanently altered daily life and social relations. Politically and economically, the failure to prevent or quickly reverse the Depression convinced many Americans that government must play a more active role in managing the economy, setting the stage for the New Deal reforms of the 1930s and a shift in expectations about federal responsibility for welfare, employment and economic stability. The period therefore acts as a hinge between the laissez-faire confidence of the 1920s and the interventionist politics that followed.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on this topic, always start from the specific command word. For describe or explain questions, structure your answer chronologically or thematically and use clear examples: for instance, when explaining why the Wall Street Crash happened, link speculation and buying on margin to falling demand and weak banking regulation. For causation questions, try to show short-term triggers and long-term structural causes and make clear how they interacted. When a question asks about impact or significance, focus on concrete effects—unemployment, Hoovervilles, the Dust Bowl migration—and weigh those impacts against other developments to reach a balanced judgement. Source questions demand careful reading: assess the origin, purpose and content of the source, consider what it reveals and what it omits, and support your evaluation with your own knowledge. For essay questions, plan a clear argument with an introduction that outlines your line of reasoning, several paragraphs that develop evidence and analysis, and a conclusion which judges the relative importance of the factors you have discussed. Use historical concepts such as continuity and change, cause and consequence, and similarity and difference to structure your analysis and show depth of understanding. Always include precise examples and dates where appropriate, avoid broad unsupported assertions, and manage your time so that longer answers receive proportionally more attention. Finally, practise writing under timed conditions and review past exam questions to become familiar with the style of questioning and the level of detail expected at GCSE.
