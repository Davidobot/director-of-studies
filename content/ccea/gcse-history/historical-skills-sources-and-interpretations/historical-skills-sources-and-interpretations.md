# Historical skills: using sources and interpretations (GCSE History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## What this skill area covers and why it matters
Using sources and interpretations is at the heart of GCSE History because it trains you to think like a historian. The examination expects you not only to know facts about the past (AO1) but also to explain and analyse those facts (AO2), to evaluate contemporary sources (AO3), and to weigh later interpretations and historians’ explanations (AO4). In practice this means learning how to read documents, images and other contemporary material critically, placing them in context, comparing them with other evidence, and recognising how and why later writers might interpret the same events differently. These skills help you make reasoned judgements about what happened and why, and they are useful both for writing balanced answers in exams and for carrying out independent enquiries in the classroom.

## Understanding the assessment objectives in everyday terms
AO1 asks you to demonstrate accurate factual knowledge and to use that knowledge precisely to support answers. AO2 requires you to explain causes, consequences, continuity and change, significance, similarity and difference; it is about argument and explanation rather than simple description. AO3 focuses on contemporary sources: you must show you can extract information, evaluate its usefulness, and use it to reach substantiated judgments. AO4 asks you to engage with interpretations: you must explain what an interpretation claims, consider the reasons behind it, compare it with other views or with your own knowledge, and judge how convincing it is. In the exam, all four objectives can appear together. For example, when studying Nazi Germany, AO1 might require accurate dates and facts about the Enabling Act, AO2 would ask why the Act mattered and what changed because of it, AO3 could present a Nazi propaganda poster for you to evaluate, and AO4 might give a historian’s argument about the extent of popular support for the regime.

## Working with contemporary sources: reading, inferring and using evidence
A contemporary source is any piece of evidence produced at the time you are studying: a newspaper article, government report, speech, photograph, private letter, propaganda poster, or a statistical table. The first step is close reading: summarise in your head or in one sentence what the source is saying or showing. Then move to inference: what does the source imply that it does not state explicitly? For example, a photograph of a Hooverville during the Great Depression tells you about visible poverty and homelessness, but it also invites questions about government response, public attitudes and regional differences. Next, use the source as evidence, linking it directly to the question. If the task asks about the impact of the Wall Street Crash, explain how the image, document or statistic supports a particular point about unemployment, decline in demand or social consequences. Always combine the source with your own knowledge: a source is rarely enough on its own to answer an AO2-style question. Contemporary sources are strongest when they are corroborated by other evidence and when you can explain both what they reveal and what they hide.

## Evaluating provenance and assessing usefulness
Provenance is simply the background to a source: who produced it, when, why and for whom. Considering provenance helps you judge reliability and bias. A speech made by a political leader during wartime, for example, will have a different purpose and tone from a private diary entry written the same week. When you evaluate usefulness, you should explain both what the source is good for and its limitations. A Ministry of Propaganda leaflet from 1936 is useful for showing official Nazi aims and the messages the regime wanted to give to its people, but it is limited as evidence of private attitudes because it was produced to persuade. Always link provenance to usefulness: the purpose and audience influence what the source can and cannot tell us. Students often forget to mention date and place; these are vital because a source written in 1939 might show quite different priorities from one written in 1944, and the same image may mean different things in Berlin or in rural Germany.

## Corroboration, contradiction and context
No single source gives the whole story, so good historical practice is to place sources into a conversation with each other. Corroboration strengthens a point when two or more sources from different authors, types or locations tell a similar story. Contradiction is just as important because it forces you to think about why accounts differ. For instance, a British government memo about the bombing of Northern Ireland may stress strategic necessity, while a local newspaper might highlight civilian suffering and poor housing revealed by the raids. The historian’s task is to explain both perspectives and to use outside knowledge to decide which is more convincing in the context of the question. Contextual knowledge—what you know about political, social and economic conditions at the time—helps you judge which sources are most likely to be accurate on particular matters and why different voices present events differently.

## Using interpretations: comparing views and making judgments
Interpretations are later explanations or arguments about the past, offered by historians or commentators. When an interpretation is provided in an exam, treat it as another piece of evidence but one that is explicitly an argument. Start by summarising the main claim of the interpretation in clear language. Then explain why the author might have taken that view by considering their context, purpose and possible sources. For example, an interpretation that argues the Cold War was primarily caused by Soviet expansion reflects an emphasis on Soviet actions and may rely heavily on events such as the takeover of Eastern Europe and the Berlin blockade. Another interpretation might stress American policies, such as the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan, and therefore reach a different conclusion. Use your own knowledge to test the interpretation: what evidence supports it, and what evidence challenges it? You should compare the interpretation with other plausible explanations and assess its limitations. In reaching a final judgement, be explicit about which interpretation you find more convincing and explain why, referring both to the interpretation itself and to specific historical evidence.

## Applying second-order concepts in source and interpretation work
Second-order concepts—continuity and change, cause and consequence, significance, similarity and difference—are the organising tools for stronger answers. Use continuity and change to explain how a source fits into a longer story: does the source show a brief change, the start of a long-term trend, or continuity? When focusing on cause and consequence, distinguish between short-term triggers and deeper structural causes. For instance, the Wall Street Crash was a short-term trigger for the Great Depression, but unequal wealth distribution and weaknesses in farming were longer-term causes. Significance helps you prioritise: not every detail in a source is equally important, so explain why a particular feature mattered historically. Similarity and difference are useful when comparing sources or interpretations: two contemporary accounts might both describe violence during the Troubles, but they may differ in whom they blame or in their description of events. Always show how these concepts help you answer the question rather than simply naming them.

## Exam technique
In source questions, begin by paraphrasing the source to show you understand it, then use the source directly as evidence, making inferences and linking those inferences to the question. Next include provenance: identify the author, date, type and purpose, and explain how these factors affect the source’s reliability and usefulness. Support your points with relevant outside knowledge and, where appropriate, compare the source with other information you know. Keep answers focused and avoid long narrative that does not use the source.

In interpretation questions, start by summarising the interpretation’s main claim in your own words. Explain the strengths of the interpretation by showing what evidence supports it. Then challenge it: give reasons why the interpretation might be limited or partial, using specific facts or alternative interpretations from your studies. Conclude with a balanced judgement that states clearly which aspects of the interpretation you accept and which you reject, and why.

Quality of written communication matters. Plan your answer briefly, write clearly and accurately, and use historical terms appropriately. Longer questions reward structured paragraphs that make a clear point, support it with evidence and analysis, and link back to the question. Time management is crucial: spend proportionately more time on the questions that carry the most marks, and leave a few minutes to check spelling, grammar and whether your answer answers the question asked.

Finally, practise under timed conditions using past question styles from topics you know, such as Nazi Germany, the Great Depression, Northern Ireland or the Cold War, and ask yourself at the end of each practice whether your answer used the source, addressed provenance, compared interpretations where required, and applied second-order concepts. Regular, focused practice will build the confidence and habits you need for strong performance in the exam.
