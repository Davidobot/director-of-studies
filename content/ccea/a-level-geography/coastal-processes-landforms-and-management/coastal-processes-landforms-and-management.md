# Coastal processes, landforms and coastal management (A-level Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview of coastal systems
Coasts are dynamic zones where the land meets the sea; they are shaped by the interplay of waves, tides, currents, sediment supply and human activity. Thinking of a coast as a system helps: there are inputs (sediment from rivers, cliff erosion, offshore deposits), transfers (waves, longshore drift, tidal flows) and outputs (sediment exported offshore or alongshore). Energy delivered by the wind, over an area called the fetch, determines wave size and hence the erosive or depositional character of a stretch of coastline. At A level you should be confident in linking energy inputs to the dominant processes and to the landforms produced, and in recognising that human interventions alter both sediment budgets and coastal resilience.

## Processes: waves, erosion, transport and deposition
Waves are the primary agent of coastal change. Wind blowing over water generates waves whose size depends on wind strength, duration and fetch. Constructive waves are low, long and have a strong swash that transports and builds up sediment on the beach; destructive waves are steep, higher frequency and have a strong backwash that removes sediment and erodes the coast. Wave refraction, the bending of waves as they approach shallow water, concentrates wave energy on headlands and disperses it in adjoining bays, producing contrasting landforms.

Erosion at the coast involves a set of processes that operate together. Hydraulic action occurs when the force of breaking waves compresses air in joints and cracks, weakening rock. Abrasion (or corrasion) is the grinding action of rock fragments hurled against cliffs. Attrition reduces rock fragments in size as they collide. Solution or corrosion dissolves soluble rock such as limestone. Transportation of sediment occurs in several modes: in suspension fine material is carried within the water column, in solution dissolved minerals are transported, saltation describes particles bouncing along the seabed, and traction moves the largest clasts by rolling or sliding. Longshore drift is the net movement of sediment along a shore when waves approach at an angle: it is central to the formation of many depositional features. The Hjulström curve is a useful conceptual model to explain why certain particle sizes are eroded, transported or deposited at different flow velocities; understanding it will help when you explain the behaviour of sand versus pebbles during storms.

## Coastal landforms: high-energy and low-energy shores
High-energy coasts, where wave energy is concentrated, characteristically develop erosional features. Cliffs and wave-cut platforms form where cliffs are undercut by erosion and collapse. Headlands, often made of resistant rock, protrude into the sea and are subject to intense erosion; differential erosion on headlands produces caves, arches, stacks and stumps as weaknesses widen and collapse in sequence. Bays form in softer rock where wave energy is dissipated and deposition commonly occurs.

Low-energy coasts are dominated by deposition and are typified by beaches, dunes, spits, tombolos and bars. Beaches may be composed of sand or shingle according to local sediment supply and wave energy; their form alters seasonally and in response to storms. Dunes develop where dry sand is available and vegetation traps and stabilises the growing ridges. Spits form where longshore drift transports sediment across a change in coastline alignment into open water; their distal ends may curve landward under wave or tidal influence, producing recurved spits. Tombolos join an island to the mainland when sediment deposits in the lee of the island, and bars are formed when a spit continues to grow across a bay, closing it off and creating a lagoon.

Many coasts are also influenced by tidal currents and estuarine processes. Tidal range affects the extent of intertidal zones, the width of beaches and the nature of sedimentation in estuaries, so always consider the tidal regime when explaining a coastal landscape.

## Emergent and submergent coastlines, and sea level change
Coastlines are shaped not only by present-day processes but by changes in sea level. Eustatic sea-level change refers to global changes in sea level caused by variations in the volume of water in the oceans (for example, global warming and melting ice). Isostatic change is local or regional uplift or subsidence of land due to tectonic or glacial processes; after the last glaciation, areas previously depressed by ice have risen (isostatic rebound), producing raised beaches. Submergent coastlines have been drowned by rising sea levels and commonly produce rias (drowned river valleys) and fjords (deep, glaciated inlets). Emergent coastlines, where relative sea level has fallen or land has risen, reveal former shorelines as raised beaches and relict cliffs.

Understanding the causes and evidence of past sea-level change is important: pollen records, raised beaches and relict landforms allow reconstruction of palaeoenvironments; these reconstructions help explain present coastal vulnerabilities and the human legacy of past climates. Today, anthropogenic climate change is causing eustatic rise and increasing storminess, creating both gradual and episodic threats to coasts worldwide.

## Coastal management: principles, techniques and trade-offs
Coastal management seeks to reduce risk to people and property while balancing environmental sustainability. Planning tools and appraisal techniques are central to decision making. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) identifies potential effects of proposed interventions on habitats and communities. Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA) attempts to weigh monetary costs against benefits but can struggle to value ecosystem services and non-market goods. The sediment cell concept recognises that shorelines function within discrete units of sediment exchange; Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) in the UK use these principles to set policies for stretches of coast, ranging from no active intervention to managed realignment.

Hard engineering options such as sea walls, revetments, rip-rap (rock armour), gabions and groynes provide immediate protection by resisting wave action or interrupting longshore drift. These structures can protect infrastructure but often have high capital and maintenance costs, may be visually intrusive, and can transfer erosion down-drift by interrupting sediment supply. Soft engineering solutions aim to work with natural processes and include beach nourishment (adding sand or shingle), dune restoration and managed realignment, where defences are realigned inland to allow the shoreline to migrate naturally. Soft approaches can be more sustainable and enhance habitats, but they may require frequent replenishment and long-term monitoring.

Integrated coastal zone management and ecosystem-based approaches emphasise multifunctional outcomes: protection, habitat creation, recreation and carbon sequestration. Decision-making must account for the local social and economic context, the timescale of benefits, likely future sea-level rise and the distribution of costs and benefits among stakeholders.

## Case studies and applications
Concrete examples are essential when explaining and evaluating coastal management. The South Devon and Dorset coastline illustrates a mix of hard and soft approaches: locations such as Lyme Regis have used sea walls, rock armour and beach nourishment alongside community-led initiatives; the region also benefits from coordinated SMP guidance because of its internationally important geology. The Medmerry scheme in West Sussex is a strong example of managed realignment in England: an engineered breach and the creation of new intertidal habitat reduced flood risk, provided recreational space and delivered long-term sustainability where protecting low-lying hinterland by hard defences would have been costly and environmentally damaging.

On a global scale, Low-Elevation Coastal Zones in small island states such as Kiribati illustrate the acute vulnerability of LEDCs to sea-level rise. Here, options are limited by financial and technical constraints; adaptation strategies include raising land, building seawalls where feasible, and, in some cases, considering migration. These contrasting contexts show why management must be tailored: what is feasible and desirable in a wealthy tourist coastline with high property values may be impractical or unjust in a low-lying island nation.

Fieldwork and data analysis are central to coastal study. Techniques include beach profiling to record cross-sectional shape, sediment grain-size analysis to infer energy conditions, and mapping of depositional forms using GPS and GIS. Remote sensing and aerial photography help monitor change along long stretches of coastline and provide evidence for SMPs and EIAs.

## Linking theory to practice in answers
When you explain or evaluate coastal topics, connect process, form and management. For example, explain why wave refraction leads to headland erosion and bay deposition, then show how that physical pattern drives management choices such as the placement of groynes or nourishment. Always consider temporal scales: short-term storm events can produce dramatic erosion, while longer-term sea-level rise will alter sediment budgets and may make current defences unsustainable. In evaluations, balance economic, social and environmental criteria and discuss uncertainty in future conditions and data limitations.

## Exam technique
Examiners expect clear, structured answers that integrate knowledge of processes, landforms and management with place-specific examples. Start longer answers with a brief definition or framing sentence that sets out your approach. Use annotated diagrams to explain processes; a well-labelled cross-section or sequence diagram (for arches to stumps, or spit development) can secure marks quickly and clarify your reasoning. In "describe" questions focus on features and patterns; in "explain" questions link causes to effects and use process vocabulary (for example hydraulic action, longshore drift, wave refraction). For "evaluate" and synoptic questions, explicitly weigh advantages and disadvantages, consider short- and long-term consequences, discuss who bears costs and gains, and conclude with a justified judgement. Always include at least one place-based example when asked for case study evidence; be specific about location and management measures, and quantify effects where possible. Time management is crucial: allocate time according to marks, leave a few minutes to proofread, and ensure your final paragraph synthesises the key points into a clear conclusion.
