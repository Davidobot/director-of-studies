# Decision‑making case studies and synoptic skills (A2) (A-level Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview and purpose of the decision‑making unit
The Decision‑making in Geography unit at A2 is designed to test your ability to think like a practising geographer faced with a real‑world problem. Rather than simply recalling facts, you will be given a resource booklet that sets out a case study: maps, statistics, reports, photographs, diagrams and infographics may all be included. The task is to adopt a role, interrogate the materials, process quantitative information where required, weigh up competing values and interests, and reach a justified recommendation that maximises overall benefits. This synoptic exercise reflects the course aim to build higher order thinking, to draw together physical and human geography knowledge, and to apply that learning to unsettled, complex scenarios that mirror decisions made by planners, emergency managers, conservationists or local communities.

## What the examination requires and how it is assessed
The examination is one hour and thirty minutes in length and the decision‑making exercise is worth 60 marks. The paper is presented as a single compulsory case study and you will be provided with a resource booklet. The examination is written as a report using the headings and subheadings supplied in the paper. You will be expected to review, analyse and interpret the resources, present quantitative material appropriately, examine conflicting values, consider alternative choices and make and justify recommendations that you argue produce the greater overall benefit. The assessment is synoptic: it explicitly requires you to draw on material studied at AS and A2 across physical and human options. The exercise tests the assessment objectives by requiring sound factual knowledge (AO1), application and analysis in context (AO2), and the use of techniques, data handling and evaluative judgement (AO3). You are advised to spend around thirty minutes reading and annotating the resources before you begin writing.

## The synoptic nature: connecting AS and A2 knowledge
A key purpose of the decision‑making task is to reward the ability to connect threads across the whole course. You may need to combine understanding of physical processes — for example flood dynamics, coastal erosion, or climate change impacts — with ideas from human geography such as land‑use planning, sustainable development, migration, or tourism management. Synoptic answers will move beyond isolated examples and instead integrate evidence and concepts: a recommendation for managed retreat on an eroding coastline should refer to coastal processes and sediment budgets as well as to social and economic consequences, environmental impact assessment and local stakeholder interests. Drawing on familiar case studies from the specification — for instance the Somerset Levels flood response, coastal management strategies in South Devon and Dorset, or climate threats to low‑lying islands such as Kiribati — shows that you can connect classroom learning to the new, unseen scenario in the resource booklet.

## Skills that you must demonstrate
During the exercise you will be expected to deploy a range of practical and analytical skills. You must be able to extract and synthesise information from a variety of sources, perform routine quantitative tasks such as calculating rates, percentages or simple indices, and present numerical evidence clearly in the body of your argument (for example describing trends in a table or sketching a quick labelled diagram). You should also show evaluative skills: consider uncertainty and limitations of the evidence, identify trade‑offs between short‑term economic gains and long‑term sustainability, and articulate how particular stakeholder groups might value different outcomes. Being able to adopt and maintain a role is important; a recommendation justified as a community representative will differ in emphasis from one written as a national planner or a conservation NGO. Quality of written communication matters: clarity, accurate use of specialist vocabulary and logically structured argument are all part of the assessment.

## Typical topics and how to bring wider case study knowledge
Decision‑making booklets commonly draw on themes that appear across the specification. Coastal management, flood risk and river management, urban development and planning, tourism pressure and ecotourism, and responses to climate change are frequent contexts. For each possible theme you should prepare a bank of transferable knowledge and exemplar case studies. For coastal issues you might draw on the South Devon and Dorset shoreline management debate and the distinctions between hard and soft engineering, sediment cells and managed retreat. For floods you should be ready to discuss channelisation, washlands, afforestation and case studies such as the Somerset Levels or major river floods in Pakistan. For tourism, ideas about capacity, honeypot sites, local economic leakage and regulatory tools used in Mallorca or Costa Rica give useful contrasts. For climate change scenarios, be prepared to discuss mitigation and adaptation strategies internationally, the implications for small island states, and the role of international agreements. When using wider case study knowledge, make explicit links between the evidence in the resource booklet and the broader example: use it as a comparator or to illustrate likely outcomes and effectiveness of management options.

## A practical approach to analysing the resource booklet
Begin by reading the entire resource booklet to form an overall impression, then annotate actively: underline key figures, note dates, label maps with directions or key features, and flag statements of uncertainty or bias. Identify who produced each resource since the source will often suggest a perspective or vested interest. Establish the spatial and temporal scale of the problem and note which stakeholders are affected. When quantitative data are supplied, perform any required calculations carefully and show workings where space permits; converting raw numbers into rates, percentages, or per capita values often clarifies trade‑offs. Where the examination asks you to process and present quantitative data, use simple, well labelled diagrams or summary sentences to communicate the pattern succinctly. Throughout this analysis you should keep your adopted role in mind and think about which priorities that role would emphasise: economic growth, social equity, environmental protection, or disaster resilience.

## Making balanced recommendations and demonstrating judgement
A good decision‑making answer balances competing values rather than offering an unqualified preference. Explicitly set out the options, evaluate their consequences across environmental, economic and social dimensions, and use criteria to compare them. Discuss feasibility, costs and benefits, likely timeframes, and risks or uncertainties. Where appropriate, recommend a combination of measures — for example immediate hard defence to protect critical infrastructure coupled with medium‑term managed realignment and long‑term monitoring and community‑led adaptation. Justify your choice by demonstrating how it provides greater overall benefits relative to alternatives, and show awareness of possible negative outcomes and how they could be mitigated. Implementation is an important part of decision‑making: outline who would be responsible for action, what timeframe and funding mechanisms might be needed, and how outcomes would be monitored and reviewed. The capacity to evaluate trade‑offs and present a clear, evidence‑based justification is what distinguishes the highest scoring responses.

## Exam technique
Effective time management, clarity of structure and evidence‑based argument are the foundations of success. Allocate the recommended reading time at the start to ensure you have a comprehensive picture of the case study; use that time to identify the most important data and any contradictions between sources. Structure your report clearly under the headings provided by the examination: an introductory paragraph setting out the role you have adopted and the scope of your report helps the examiner understand your perspective, followed by a concise background and description of the problem using data from the resource booklet. When presenting options, organise each option into its likely environmental, social and economic impacts and include the quantitative evidence that supports your assessment. Use paragraphs that flow logically from analysis to evaluation; link each evaluative point back to the resources and to relevant geographical theory or case study experience from your course. When you make your recommendation, be explicit about why it offers the greater overall benefit and set out a realistic implementation plan with monitoring and contingency measures. Keep language precise, avoid vague assertions, and make sure spelling, punctuation and specialist terminology are accurate to satisfy quality of written communication requirements. Finally, leave a few minutes to proofread, check that any calculations are correct and that your argument remains coherent from introduction to conclusion.
