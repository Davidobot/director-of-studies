# Plate tectonics, volcanoes and seismic hazards (A-level Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Introduction: why plate tectonics matters in geography
Plate tectonics is the unifying theory that explains the large-scale movement of Earth’s lithosphere and the distribution of many physical hazards. For A-level Geography you need to move beyond memorising plate names and be able to explain processes, link those processes to the landforms they create, and evaluate the resulting social, economic and environmental impacts. Tectonic activity shapes landscapes from ocean ridges and rift valleys to fold mountain belts and island arcs, and it produces hazards — volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis and associated secondary effects such as landslides and liquefaction. At the same time, volcanic and seismic regions can bring benefits: fertile soils, geothermal energy, mineral resources and tourism. Explanations that balance physical cause with human consequence, illustrated with well-chosen case studies, are central to examination answers.

## Plate boundaries and the processes that operate there
Understanding the four broad types of plate margin is essential. Constructive margins (divergent) are where plates move apart: mantle upwelling forms new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges and continental rifting can create rift valleys. Destructive margins (convergent) occur where an oceanic plate subducts beneath another plate; this produces deep-sea trenches, volcanic arcs and powerful earthquakes. Collision margins develop where two continental plates meet, producing large fold mountain belts such as the Himalayas. Conservative margins (transform) involve lateral sliding between plates and are typified by strike-slip faults like the San Andreas; they generate shallow, often strong earthquakes. The physical processes at these margins include faulting, folding, magmatism, crustal deformation and heat transfer from the mantle. Landforms are a direct expression of these processes: ocean ridges and rift valleys at constructive margins, deep trenches and island arcs at destructive margins, and extensive folding and fault-blocking at collision zones. Being able to describe how forces and movements produce these landforms, illustrated with named examples, demonstrates strong AO1 knowledge and sets you up for applied analysis questions.

## Volcanic activity: types, products and landforms
Volcanism varies with tectonic setting and magma chemistry. At constructive margins and hotspots magmas tend to be basaltic, relatively low in silica, mobile and capable of producing effusive eruptions and shield volcanoes. At destructive margins, magmas are frequently more andesitic or rhyolitic, often more viscous and gas-rich, producing explosive eruptions, pyroclastic flows and composite cone volcanoes. Hotspot volcanism, exemplified by the Hawaiian chain, results when a plume generates volcanism within a plate, producing linear island chains as the plate moves. Key volcanic products include lava flows, tephra, ash, pyroclastic flows and volcanic gases; these create landforms such as lava plateaux, stratovolcanoes, calderas and volcanic necks. Volcanic hazards are diverse: ashfall affects air travel and agriculture, pyroclastic flows and lahars are lethal and fast-moving, and large eruptions can inject sulphur aerosols into the stratosphere altering global climate for a few years. Case studies that link the physical event to impacts and responses — for example Pinatubo 1991 where widespread ash and atmospheric cooling followed a major eruption, and Montserrat 1995 onwards where long-term evacuation and exclusion zones transformed local society — show depth of understanding.

## Seismic activity: faulting, waves and secondary effects
Earthquakes are sudden releases of strain accumulated in the crust. Elastic rebound on faults generates body waves (primary P-waves and secondary S-waves) that travel through the Earth, and surface waves that travel along its exterior; understanding these wave types helps explain damage patterns. Magnitude (a measure of energy release) and intensity (the local effects felt and recorded) are distinct but both crucial when explaining impacts. Seismic shaking can cause building collapse, trigger landslides on steep slopes and generate soil liquefaction where water-saturated sediments temporarily behave like a liquid, devastating foundations. Subduction earthquakes can displace the seafloor and produce tsunamis, as demonstrated by the 2011 Tohoku event: a very large megathrust earthquake generated a destructive tsunami that caused widespread coastal damage and, indirectly, a nuclear emergency. In answers, link the physical mechanics (fault type, focal depth, wave propagation) to observed consequences, and use named events to illustrate differences in outcomes between contexts and preparedness levels.

## Impacts and the human response: vulnerability, resilience and management
The severity of tectonic hazards for people depends on exposure, vulnerability and capacity to respond. MEDCs and LEDCs often experience similar tectonic forces but show very different outcomes because of building standards, emergency planning, infrastructure quality and governance. For example, a shallow earthquake beneath a densely populated city with weak construction often causes many more casualties than a deeper, similarly energetic event in a region with strict building codes. Management strategies operate at pre-event, event and post-event stages. Before events, hazard mapping, land-use zoning, stringent building regulations and public education reduce vulnerability. During events, early warning systems, evacuation routes and well-rehearsed response plans save lives; tsunami warning systems and siren/evacuation protocols are particularly important in subduction zone settings. After events, rapid search-and-rescue, disaster relief, long-term housing solutions and economic recovery programmes are vital. Evaluation in essays should weigh the effectiveness of these strategies and discuss trade-offs: hard engineering and relocation can be costly and socially disruptive, while softer approaches such as community preparedness and retrofitting may be more sustainable but require sustained investment and political will.

## Monitoring, prediction and the limits of forecasting
Monitoring uses seismic networks, GPS and InSAR measurements of ground deformation, gas emissions, thermal changes and historical records. These techniques improve our understanding of tectonic processes and provide some lead indicators of volcanic unrest or unusual seismicity. Predicting the exact time, place and magnitude of earthquakes remains extremely difficult; probabilistic forecasting, seismic gap theory and strain accumulation models offer general assessments of hazard but are limited in specificity. Volcanic prediction is more advanced in some cases: rising seismicity, ground inflation, increased gas emissions and thermal anomalies can signal magma movement and raise the likelihood of eruption, allowing authorities to implement staged evacuations. However, false alarms and the social, economic and political costs of evacuations complicate decision-making. When answering exam questions, discuss both the strengths of monitoring technologies and the scientific and social challenges of issuing warnings and enforcing protective measures, using examples such as evacuation procedures on Montserrat, successful early warnings minimizing losses in some volcanic crises, and the catastrophic cascading failures after Tohoku where tsunami defences were overtopped.

## Case study synthesis: choosing and using examples effectively
A strong A-level answer uses well-chosen, detailed case studies to illustrate the link between process and impact and to support evaluation. Select a volcanic case study that allows you to discuss physical causes, impacts and management — Pinatubo 1991 and Montserrat 1995–present are both useful: Pinatubo demonstrates global atmospheric effects and successful international-scale responses, while Montserrat highlights long-term social displacement and exclusion zones. For seismic hazards choose contrasting earthquake case studies so you can evaluate differences in vulnerability and response; pairing Tohoku 2011 (MEDC, tsunami, nuclear issues, complex infrastructure impacts) with a high-casualty LEDC earthquake such as Haiti 2010 (weak construction, governance challenges) allows you to analyse how socio-economic context alters outcomes. Always name locations, provide dates, quantify impacts where possible (fatalities, economic losses, displaced populations) and link these specifics to wider concepts such as resilience, mitigation and sustainable planning. Where possible, refer back to physical causes (plate margin type, fault mechanism, volcanic magma type) to show synoptic understanding across the course.

## Exam technique
Start answers by identifying the command word: define, describe, explain, evaluate or assess require different approaches. For definitions and descriptions focus on clear, precise language and specific examples. For explain questions, structure answers so the physical process is described first and then linked to outcomes; use words such as “therefore” and “as a result” to show causal chains. For evaluate and assess tasks balance strengths and weaknesses, give criteria for judgment, and reach a reasoned conclusion. Always integrate named case studies rather than generic examples; a short paragraph that anchors your answer to a specific eruption or earthquake scores highly. Use simple labelled diagrams where appropriate: a cross-section of a subduction zone, a diagram of wave types, or a sketch of a composite volcano can earn marks, but ensure labels are clear and that the diagram is referenced in your text. Manage time by allocating minutes to parts of the paper in proportion to their marks; for example, in A2 papers allow longer for extended evaluations and the decision-making paper allocate reading time before writing. For data- or resource-based questions, practice interpreting graphs, maps and tables quickly and linking them to theory. When assessing management, judge both physical effectiveness and social consequences; mention costs, equity, feasibility and long-term sustainability. Finally, write legibly, use specialist vocabulary correctly, and check your answer for clarity: examiners reward precise, well-structured responses that demonstrate integrated knowledge, applied analysis and balanced evaluation.
