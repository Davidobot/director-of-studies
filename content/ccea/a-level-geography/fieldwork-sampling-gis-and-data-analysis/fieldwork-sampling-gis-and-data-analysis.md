# Fieldwork, sampling, GIS and data analysis skills (A-level Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview and purpose of fieldwork in A‑level Geography
Fieldwork is not an optional extra in A‑level Geography; it is central to how geographers investigate real places, test hypotheses and bring classroom theory to life. At AS level you will be expected to design and carry out a focused investigation, collect first‑hand data, and present a short summary and a table of raw data. At A2 you extend these skills by handling larger or more complex datasets, making connections between topics, and using a wider range of analytical methods. Good fieldwork links aims and hypotheses to a clear sampling strategy and measurement techniques, and it uses both primary observations and relevant secondary sources such as Ordnance Survey maps, aerial photographs, satellite imagery and synoptic charts. A successful investigation will demonstrate knowledge (AO1), apply that knowledge to analyse and interpret information (AO2), and use appropriate methods to investigate and evaluate findings (AO3).

## Planning fieldwork and managing safety, ethics and logistics
Effective fieldwork begins long before you reach the study site. You must write a concise statement that sets out the location, aims and hypotheses of the study; for AS Unit 3 this is presented as a word‑processed summary of about 100 words and accompanies the raw data table. Planning should include a clear rationale for your chosen sampling method, the equipment required, the roles of team members, timing and the temporal scope of data collection. Safety planning is essential: a simple risk assessment should identify hazards, control measures and contingency plans for accidents or severe weather. Ethical considerations include obtaining permission to survey private land, gaining informed consent where people are involved, and protecting personal data and anonymity. Practical logistics such as transport, access to facilities, battery and equipment checks, and alternative plans for poor weather are all part of the planning process and improve reliability by reducing the number of unplanned interruptions.

## Sampling strategies: design, bias and sample size
Choosing an appropriate sampling strategy is one of the most important decisions in fieldwork because it determines how representative and trustworthy your results will be. Random sampling gives every unit an equal chance of selection and is ideal where you want to avoid systematic bias; in practice, random samples can be chosen using random numbers or GIS point generation. Systematic sampling measures every nth unit along a transect or grid and is efficient for studies along a linear gradient, such as a river channel or an urban transect, but it can be biased if a periodic pattern coincides with the sampling interval. Stratified sampling divides the study area into meaningful subgroups and samples proportionally from each stratum, which is useful when different zones (for example urban core, inner suburbs and rural fringe) are known to differ. Pragmatic sampling recognises real constraints and adapts the design: it is acceptable when time, access or safety prohibit ideal methods, but you must justify the compromises and discuss limitations. Point, line and quadrat sampling are methods for recording biotic and abiotic features in ecological or coastal studies: point sampling records observations at fixed points, line sampling records occurrences along transects, and quadrats sample a defined area to estimate abundance, frequency and percentage cover. Sample size should be sufficient to detect patterns but balanced against practicalities; small samples reduce statistical power and increase the influence of outliers, so explain and justify your chosen sample size in your planning.

## Data collection techniques and instruments
Data collection must be appropriate to your hypothesis. In physical geography you might measure river velocity using float and stopwatch or a current meter, estimate pebble size using a calliper or pebble chart and record channel cross‑sections with a tape and clinometer. In human geography you might use pedestrian counts or timed observations to measure footfall, structured questionnaires to collect attitudes, or land use surveys using field sketches and GPS waypoints. For ecological work, soil pH meters, light meters, and quadrat sampling for vegetation provide quantitative measures; photographic records and unstructured interviews provide qualitative context. Accurate recording is vital: raw data should be entered directly into a table or spreadsheet using clear column headings, units, and normal conventions. Where possible use digital devices to timestamp and geolocate observations. Remember that qualitative evidence—field notes, photographs and short interview extracts—adds depth to numerical results and helps interpret patterns revealed by quantitative analysis.

## Data processing, GIS and statistical analysis
Once collected, data must be processed and analysed to extract meaning. Spreadsheets are the primary tool for organising raw data, calculating basic statistics and producing graphs. Basic descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode and range summarise central tendency and spread; the choice between mean and median depends on whether data contain outliers. Spearman’s rank correlation is a non‑parametric test used to assess monotonic relationships between ranked variables and is appropriate when data are not normally distributed. Nearest neighbour analysis tests for the spatial clustering or dispersion of points and is useful for mapping settlement patterns or features such as trees or collision sites. At A2 you may also encounter chi‑squared tests for association between categorical variables and location quotients to assess concentration of industry or activity. It is vital to explain assumptions and to state whether a statistical test is appropriate; correlation does not prove causation, and p‑values or significance statements should be interpreted cautiously.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are powerful for managing, analysing and presenting spatial data. GIS lets you combine vector layers (points, lines, polygons) with raster layers (imagery, elevation), perform spatial joins to link attributes to locations, create buffers to model influence zones, and interpolate continuous surfaces from point data using techniques such as inverse distance weighting. Cartographic outputs might include choropleth maps to show density or rates, isoline maps to show gradients such as temperature or elevation, dot maps to indicate counts, flow maps to represent movement, and proportional symbol maps to show magnitude. When constructing maps and graphs, follow geographical conventions: include a clear title, labelled axes with units, a legend/key, scale bar or ratio, frame and a north arrow where appropriate. Annotate outputs to highlight key patterns and to link visual evidence to your argument.

## Presenting, interpreting and evaluating findings
Presentation should combine clear graphics with succinct written interpretation. Choose graph types that match your data: scatter graphs to explore relationships and correlation, line graphs for change through space or time, bar charts for categorical comparisons, pie charts for proportional breakdowns (used sparingly), and triangular graphs where three components sum to a whole such as sediment composition. Annotated sketch maps are valuable in the exam when you cannot produce full cartography; a well‑labelled sketch that shows relief, land use and sampling locations is often sufficient if accompanied by explanation.

Interpretation moves from description to explanation: link observed patterns to physical processes, human decisions or spatial interactions, and use secondary data or theory to support explanations. A good evaluation critiques the methods and the evidence: discuss reliability (repeatability and instrument precision), validity (how well methods measured the intended variable), sampling bias, spatial and temporal limitations, and the effect of anomalous data. Suggest concrete improvements such as increasing sample size, stratifying differently, repeating measurements at different times to account for temporal variation, or using more precise instruments. When making recommendations, be specific about feasibility and expected benefit.

## Practical examples and common fieldwork investigations
Common AS investigations include measuring channel velocity and bedload to test relationships between discharge and transport, comparing pebble roundness and size along a river to demonstrate downstream changes, surveying urban land use and pedestrian counts to test hypotheses about retail hierarchy, and using quadrats to study plant succession on dune systems. Each example illustrates how sampling, measurement and analysis combine: a river study might use systematic transects across cross‑sections, record raw velocity and pebble diameter data in spreadsheets, produce scatter plots and Spearman’s rank to test relationships, and map sampling locations in GIS to look for spatial trends. In human geography, pedestrian counts timed in fixed intervals might be combined with land use mapping and plotted as a flow map to show movement towards transport hubs. Drawing on examples helps exam answers to be concrete and demonstrates the practical relevance of theoretical material.

## Exam technique
When you enter an exam, manage your time and evidence your fieldwork experience explicitly. For AS Unit 3 you will attach your 100‑word summary and raw data table to the script; these are not marked directly but questions will require you to use them, so make sure the table contains raw numerical data and clear variable labels with units. Read the paper carefully and plan answers: for multipart compulsory questions allocate time proportionally to marks, and for A2 decision‑making papers spend the advised 30 minutes reading the resource booklet to identify key stakeholders, constraints and data. In your answers demonstrate all three assessment objectives: show relevant factual knowledge (AO1), apply and interpret this knowledge to explain patterns and link to theory or secondary evidence (AO2), and describe methods, carry out appropriate calculations, present graphs or maps and evaluate strengths and weaknesses (AO3). Always state your sampling strategy and justify it, show calculations with units and clear working, label and annotate graphs and maps following cartographic conventions, and be precise when giving recommendations or improvements. For evaluative and synoptic questions, compare alternative explanations and reach a reasoned judgement—because examiners reward reasoned, evidence‑based conclusions and clear written communication. Finally, keep your writing legible and well structured, use specialist vocabulary where suitable, and remember that a short, well‑supported conclusion and a critical evaluation often separate higher‑band answers from average ones.
