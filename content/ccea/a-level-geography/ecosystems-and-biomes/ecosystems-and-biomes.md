# Ecosystems and biomes (tropical, tundra, succession) (A-level Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## An overview of biomes and ecosystem functioning
Biomes are the large-scale, recognisable ecological zones of the Earth, each shaped by climate, soils, vegetation and the interactions between living organisms and their physical environment. Tropical rainforests, tropical grasslands (savannas), deserts, temperate grasslands and tundra are examples of major biomes whose global distributions reflect the patterns of atmospheric circulation, ocean currents and latitude. At the level of ecosystems, it is useful to think in terms of biotic components (plants, animals, microbes) and abiotic components (climate, soil, hydrology and geology), together with the flows of energy and cycles of nutrients. Energy enters almost all ecosystems as sunlight that is captured by autotrophs (plants) and moves through food chains to herbivores, predators and decomposers; matter circulates locally in pools and fluxes, with litter, soil organic matter and nutrients forming critical stores. Understanding these flows and stores – and how they vary between, for example, a humid tropical forest and the Arctic tundra – is central to answering examination questions that demand explanation, comparison and evaluation.

## Tropical ecosystems: location, climate and internal structure
Tropical biomes are found primarily between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, where the Hadley cell and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) control large-scale patterns of rising and sinking air. Where warm, moist air rises near the equator it cools and releases heavy rainfall, creating the classic humid tropical rainforest. In subtropical latitudes, descending dry air produces deserts. Between these extremes, the seasonal movement of the ITCZ produces the wet and dry seasons characteristic of tropical grasslands or savannas. Tropical rainforests are structurally complex, with vertical stratification from emergent trees through canopy, understory and forest floor. This vertical structure supports very high biodiversity and high rates of productivity and decomposition. Despite the apparent fertility of a lush forest, the underlying soils are often heavily weathered and low in available nutrients; the rapid cycling of organic matter and nutrients in the litter and biomass keeps fertility tied to living plants rather than to the mineral soil.

## Nutrient cycling and contrasts between tropical rainforest and tundra
The rate at which nutrients are recycled distinguishes many biomes. In tropical rainforests warm temperatures and high moisture accelerate decomposition, producing a fast nutrient cycle where nutrients are quickly taken up by plants. Soils such as oxisols are highly weathered and can be poor in mineral nutrients; the ecosystem depends on recycling in biomass and litter. By contrast, tundra ecosystems operate under cold conditions that slow decomposition to a crawl. Permafrost and permanently or seasonally frozen ground prevent deep rooting and limit drainage. Organic matter accumulates as peat or organic-rich surface layers, and soils are shallow and often acidic, with low rates of nutrient turnover. Temperate grasslands present another contrast: deep, humus-rich soils (mollisols or chernozems) store high levels of organic matter and nutrients accumulated from long-term grass productivity and residue, making them among the world’s most fertile agricultural soils.

## The tundra biome: climate, soils and contemporary change
Tundra occurs at high latitudes and at high elevations where cold limits plant growth to low-stature vegetation: mosses, lichens, grasses, dwarf shrubs and occasional stunted trees. The climate is characterised by low mean annual temperatures, a short growing season and often low precipitation that may fall as snow. Soils commonly have permafrost within a metre or two of the surface; the active layer above it thawing each summer. These Gelisol-type soils are shallow and waterlogged in the active layer, which creates anaerobic conditions and slow decomposition. Contemporary warming poses a fundamental threat to tundra systems because rising temperatures deepen the active layer, accelerate decomposition, destabilise ground (thermokarst), alter hydrology and promote shrub encroachment. The release of previously frozen organic carbon as CO2 and methane represents a potential positive feedback to global warming. Regional studies from places such as Alaska and northern Siberia document earlier snowmelt, more frequent fire and expanding shrub vegetation; such changes have clear implications for indigenous livelihoods, wildlife and global carbon budgets.

## Succession: processes, seral stages and plagioclimax
Succession describes the orderly sequence of plant and animal communities replacing one another through time on newly exposed or disturbed ground. Primary succession occurs on previously uncolonised surfaces, such as new lava flows or bare sand, where there is no soil; pioneer species (lichens, mosses, hardy grasses) begin the process by stabilising the substrate and contributing organic matter that gradually builds soil. Secondary succession proceeds where soil remains after a disturbance (for example after a fire, abandonment of agricultural land or storm damage); recovery is typically faster. Seral stages are the intermediate stages between pioneers and the climatic climax, which is the vegetation type expected under the local climate if human interference were absent. Plagioclimax refers to a community arrested before the climatic climax because of continuing human activity such as grazing, mowing or burning; many cultural landscapes are maintained in plagioclimax states. Illustrative examples include sand dune succession where marram grass stabilises foredunes and is followed by grasses, then scrub and eventually maritime woodland if conditions allow, and woodland succession in places such as small managed sites where long-term monitoring (for example at a local wood like Breen Wood) shows increasing soil depth, higher biomass and greater species richness through time.

## Human impacts on tropical ecosystems and approaches to sustainability
Tropical ecosystems face multiple human pressures: conversion to agriculture and pasture, selective and clear-fell logging, road building, mining and urban expansion. These activities alter the trophic structure, disrupt nutrient cycles and expose soils to erosion. In tropical forest regions such as the Amazon Basin, large-scale deforestation reduces litter inputs and canopy cover, accelerates soil degradation and releases significant stores of carbon. Sustainable approaches aim to reconcile development needs with ecological integrity. Agroforestry is one such approach; in the Brazilian Amazon, agroforestry projects in places such as Tomé-Açu demonstrate how integrating trees with crops can maintain soil cover, recycle nutrients and provide livelihoods without wholesale forest clearance. Other strategies include selective logging, forest reserves and community-based management, payment for ecosystem services schemes and the promotion of certified sustainable timber and commodity supply chains. When evaluating these approaches it is important to balance environmental benefits with socio-economic realities: who gains, who loses, how costs are borne and whether long-term institutional support exists.

## Small-scale ecosystems and field examples for revision
For examination purposes it is valuable to retain a small-scale ecosystem case study that you can describe in some detail. A temperate woodland such as Breen Wood can be used to illustrate ecosystem components and nutrient cycling at a small scale: describe the abiotic setting, dominant species, energy inputs, trophic relationships and typical human uses. For succession, use a sand dune sequence as a clear, visual example: name the pioneer species, describe soil development, explain how microclimate and salt spray affect colonisation, and identify the climax or plagioclimax stages depending on human influence. For tropical forest examples, the Amazon Basin functions well as a regional case study because it combines discussions of biodiversity, carbon storage, nutrient cycling and large-scale drivers of change; for sustainable management at local scale, describe agroforestry at Tomé-Açu to show a positive alternative to clear-felling. For tundra, a regional example from Alaska or northern Siberia allows you to discuss permafrost, thermokarst, shrub expansion and the socio-economic impacts on indigenous communities.

## Exam technique
When answering examination questions on ecosystems and biomes, always begin by unpacking the command word: explain, evaluate, describe, assess and compare require different emphasis. For "describe" questions give clear factual detail; for "explain" questions link cause and effect; for "evaluate" and "assess" questions weigh evidence, give balanced judgements and consider uncertainties. Use named case studies—Amazon Basin, Tomé-Açu, Breen Wood, an Arctic tundra region—to ground your answers; brief, specific facts about these places lend credibility and allow you to make precise evaluative points. Diagrams are powerful: a labelled tropical rainforest profile, a nutrient cycle diagram contrasting rainforest and tundra, and a seral diagram for succession will score marks if neatly drawn and integrated into your explanation. Always link processes: when discussing tropical deforestation, explain how removal of canopy alters interception, increases runoff and erosion, disrupts nutrient recycling and releases carbon. When asked to evaluate management, consider environmental, social and economic dimensions and discuss feasibility, equity and evidence of effectiveness. In data-led questions or fieldwork-related tasks, be prepared to interpret graphs, maps or tables and to comment on sampling, limitations and reliability. Time management is vital: allocate time in proportion to marks, plan longer answers briefly before writing, and leave a few minutes to proofread extended responses to ensure clarity, accurate specialist vocabulary and well-structured paragraphs. Practise writing synoptic answers that draw connections across topics—climate, soils, vegetation and human activity—because A2 questions and higher-mark parts reward the ability to synthesise knowledge across the course.
