# Climate change — causes, impacts and responses (A-level Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: what we mean by climate change
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in average weather patterns and trends in temperature, precipitation, wind and sea level. These shifts can be natural, occurring over thousands to millions of years, but since the industrial revolution the dominant trend has been an unusually rapid warming of the planet driven by human activity. For A‑level Geography you need to distinguish between past natural variability and the recent pattern of change that is linked to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Understanding climate change means linking evidence, physical mechanisms and human systems: how the climate has changed before, what drives it, how changes affect environments and societies, and what practical responses are available at local, national and international scales.

## Evidence from the past and how climates have changed
Our knowledge of past climates comes from a range of proxies and direct records that vary in timescale. Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica preserve bubbles of ancient air and layers of snow that record past temperatures and atmospheric gas concentrations over hundreds of thousands of years. Pollen preserved in peat and lake sediments records past vegetation and therefore climate at regional scales. Ocean‑floor sediments accumulate shells and isotopes that reflect ocean temperatures and circulation. Together these records show cycles of glacial and interglacial periods driven by orbital variations, and they also show that current atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane concentrations are higher than at any time in the last several hundred thousand years. For revision, link the proxy evidence to interpretation: for example, more pollen from temperate species indicates warmer conditions, heavier oxygen isotopes in foraminifera indicate cooler sea surface temperatures, and trapped air bubbles in ice cores directly record greenhouse gas concentrations. Recognise too that the Holocene, the warm period since the end of the last glaciation, provided relative climatic stability that allowed complex human societies to develop; modern warming is superimposed on that background.

## Natural drivers of climate variability
Before considering human causes it is important to be clear about natural drivers. Long‑term factors include astronomical cycles (Milankovitch forcing) that change the distribution of sunlight across the Earth and drive glacial‑interglacial cycles. Volcanic eruptions inject aerosols into the stratosphere that reflect sunlight and can cause short‑term cooling for a few years after large eruptions. Solar output fluctuates slightly on decadal to centennial timescales and can influence climate regionally. Plate tectonics and continental drift affect ocean circulation and the long‑term distribution of land and sea, altering climate over millions of years. When you answer exam questions you should be able to distinguish these natural causes by timescale and mechanism, and explain why they cannot account for the rapid warming observed over the last century. For example, volcanic forcing causes brief cooling episodes but cannot explain the sustained rise in global mean temperature nor the concurrent rise in atmospheric CO2.

## Human causes: the enhanced greenhouse effect
The most important human driver of recent climate change is the enhanced greenhouse effect. Certain gases in the atmosphere—carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases—absorb outgoing longwave radiation and warm the lower atmosphere. Since the late 18th century the combustion of fossil fuels, industrial processes, deforestation and certain agricultural practices have increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. CO2 is the largest single contributor by mass because of fossil fuel burning and land‑use change, while methane from wetlands, ruminant livestock and fossil fuel extraction contributes significantly to near‑term warming. Land‑use change, particularly deforestation in tropical regions such as parts of the Amazon Basin, both releases carbon and reduces the capacity of ecosystems to sequester CO2. In exam answers you should explain the physical mechanism—how increased greenhouse gases change the planet’s energy balance—and then link this mechanism to observed changes such as global temperature rise, ocean warming, and the intensification of the hydrological cycle.

## Physical and socio‑economic impacts: winners and losers
Climate change has diverse impacts on natural systems and human societies, and these impacts vary by region and by level of development. Physically, the atmosphere and oceans have warmed, glaciers and ice sheets have retreated, permafrost in tundra regions is thawing, and sea levels are rising due to thermal expansion and ice melt. These changes affect ecosystems: tundra ecosystems are particularly sensitive because thawing permafrost alters soil structure, nutrient cycling and the availability of habitat for specialist species; mangrove and coral reef ecosystems are threatened by sea level rise and ocean warming. Economically and socially, impacts are uneven. Wealthier countries (MEDCs) often have greater capacity to adapt through infrastructure investment and insurance mechanisms, but they still face major costs from extreme events—storm surges, heatwaves and wildfire. Less developed countries (LEDCs) commonly bear disproportionate harm while having fewer resources to cope; small island states such as Kiribati and low‑lying delta regions face existential threats from sea level rise, and subsistence farmers in semi‑arid regions face increased drought risk. Illustrative case studies are useful: the flooding of Pakistan in 2010 affected millions and highlighted vulnerability in a lower‑income country, while the UK’s Somerset Levels flood event in 2014 showed how even well‑resourced countries can suffer widespread disruption when extreme rainfall overwhelms flood defences. When you discuss impacts, address both physical changes and their social consequences, considering exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity.

## Ecosystem responses and feedbacks
Ecosystems both experience the direct effects of climate change and feed back into the climate system. In tundra regions, thawing permafrost releases previously frozen organic carbon as CO2 and methane, creating a positive feedback that amplifies warming. Tropical forests are carbon reservoirs but are vulnerable to deforestation and drought; extensive forest loss in the Amazon could reduce carbon uptake and alter regional rainfall patterns, potentially leading to a shift from rainforest to savanna in some areas. Marine ecosystems respond to warming and acidification: coral reefs bleach when seawater temperatures rise, reducing biodiversity and the services reefs provide to coastal populations. These ecosystem feedbacks are central to understanding future trajectories because they can accelerate or dampen climate change. For exams, explain feedback mechanisms clearly and use specific examples to show how human actions (for example clearing forests or protecting wetlands) can influence those feedbacks.

## Responses: mitigation, adaptation and governance
Responses to climate change fall broadly into mitigation—reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissions—and adaptation—reducing vulnerability to unavoidable change. Mitigation includes transitioning energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable sources, improving energy efficiency, changing transport systems, protecting and restoring forests, and developing technological options such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). Adaptation comprises practical measures such as floodplain zoning, coastal defences or managed retreat, drought‑resilient agriculture, and modifying infrastructure to withstand higher temperatures and more intense storms. Importantly, effective responses often combine mitigation and adaptation and are planned at multiple scales from local community action to international treaties. International governance has evolved from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change through mechanisms such as the Kyoto Protocol to more recent agreements that emphasise nationally determined contributions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change plays a central scientific role by assessing evidence and setting out scenarios that inform policy. When answering questions about responses, evaluate the feasibility, equity and long‑term effectiveness of different strategies, and be ready to discuss barriers such as political will, economic costs, and issues of climate justice where countries that contributed least to the problem may suffer most.

## Linking climate change to other topics and case studies
A useful revision habit is to connect climate change to other parts of the syllabus. For example, coastal management links directly to sea level rise: shoreline management plans that balance hard engineering with managed retreat offer practical case material. River flood risk and land use change are closely connected: urbanisation and deforestation alter runoff and flood peaks. At the ecosystem scale, case studies such as agroforestry projects in Tomé‑Açu illustrate attempts to reconcile economic development with forest conservation in tropical regions. Small island states such as Kiribati provide stark examples of social and political challenges posed by sea level rise, while extreme weather events like Hurricane Katrina or Typhoon Haiyan can be used to discuss disaster risk, preparedness and recovery. When preparing for essays, assemble a small set of well‑learned case studies (covering MEDC and LEDC examples) and be ready to apply them to different questions; depth and application are more valuable than having many shallow examples.

## Exam technique
Approach questions by identifying the command words and aligning your response to the assessment objectives. For AO1, give clear definitions and accurate factual detail, showing you understand mechanisms and evidence. For AO2, apply that knowledge to the context in the question: analyse causes, interpret data or maps, compare places, and reach reasoned judgements. For AO3, demonstrate geographical skills by using evidence, constructing arguments and evaluating methods or policies. In extended answers, structure your response with an introduction that addresses the question directly, a development that uses case study evidence and explanation, and a conclusion that weighs up the arguments and reaches a clear judgement. Always integrate specific examples rather than only theoretical descriptions; a named case study used well can lift a response from generic to convincing. Where you are asked to evaluate, discuss strengths and limitations, and consider counterarguments rather than only listing positives. For decision‑making or synoptic tasks, adopt the required role, prioritise criteria, compare options using evidence and make justified recommendations, showing awareness of trade‑offs and uncertainties. Finally, use diagrams and annotated sketches where appropriate to support explanation, keep writing clear and concise, and allocate time so that longer, higher‑mark questions receive proportionately more attention.
