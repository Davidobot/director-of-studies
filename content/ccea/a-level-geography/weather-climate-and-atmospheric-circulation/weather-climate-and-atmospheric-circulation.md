# Weather, climate and atmospheric circulation (A-level Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Weather, climate and the global energy balance
Weather describes the short-term state of the atmosphere at a place and time, while climate is the long-term average of those conditions. Understanding the difference is essential: a storm is weather, a pattern of wetter winters and hotter summers over decades is climate. The ultimate driver of both weather and climate is the global energy balance. Incoming shortwave solar radiation is absorbed, reflected or scattered; the Earth and its atmosphere then emit longwave radiation back to space. The proportion of incoming energy reflected is governed by albedo, so bright surfaces such as ice reflect more energy than dark oceans. The atmosphere’s greenhouse gases retain part of the outgoing longwave radiation, keeping global temperatures higher than they would be without this natural greenhouse effect. Any change in the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation — from changes in solar output, volcanic aerosols, greenhouse gas concentrations or surface albedo — shifts climate.

Heat is redistributed from regions of net surplus (the tropics) to regions of net deficit (the poles) by both the atmosphere and the oceans. These two components work together: atmospheric circulation transfers heat as moving air, and ocean currents move heat as water masses. When you encounter explanations of global patterns of temperature, pressure and precipitation in the exam, always link them back to this energy balance and the large-scale transport of heat and moisture.

## The general circulation of the atmosphere: cells, pressure belts and winds
The atmosphere does not circulate uniformly; rather it operates in large-scale cells and pressure belts that explain broad climatic zones. The tri-cellular model divides each hemisphere into three dominant cells: the Hadley cell between the equator and roughly 30° latitude, the Ferrel cell across the mid-latitudes, and the Polar cell nearer the poles. At the equator, intense solar heating causes air to rise, creating a low-pressure zone and heavy convective rainfall associated with the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone. That rising air moves poleward aloft and descends around 30° to form the subtropical high-pressure belts where deserts are common. Around 60° the Ferrel and Polar cells interact to form subpolar low-pressure zones, while the poles tend to be areas of high pressure.

These pressure belts drive the major wind systems: trade winds blow toward the equator from the subtropical highs, westerlies dominate the mid-latitudes and polar easterlies affect higher latitudes. The Coriolis effect, caused by Earth’s rotation, deflects moving air to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, which gives winds their characteristic directions. The strength of the Coriolis force varies with latitude, being zero at the equator and strongest near the poles, so it has no appreciable effect on very small-scale motions.

Jet streams are fast-flowing, narrow air currents found near the tropopause at the boundary between troposphere and stratosphere. They form where there are strong temperature gradients, especially between the mid-latitude westerlies and polar easterlies. The Polar Front Jet Stream in particular plays a crucial role in steering mid-latitude depressions and controlling the track of weather systems that affect the British Isles. When the jet stream shifts north or south, the pattern of high- and low-pressure systems changes, leading to prolonged spells of wet or dry weather in affected regions.

## Heat transfer and the controls on air temperature
Air temperature at any location is controlled by a combination of factors that can be understood as local expressions of global processes. Latitude sets the broadest control because solar angle and day length vary with latitude; the tropics receive more concentrated sunlight than the poles, producing warmer climates. Continentality, or distance from the sea, produces marked differences: large land masses heat and cool faster than oceans, creating more extreme temperature ranges inland than at coasts. This is why places deep within Eurasia experience hot summers and very cold winters, while islands and maritime coasts, such as the western coasts of Britain and Ireland, have milder winters and cooler summers.

Altitude also matters because temperature falls with height in the troposphere. The environmental lapse rate is roughly 6.5°C per kilometre on average, so mountainous areas are significantly cooler than lowlands at the same latitude. Ocean currents further modify temperature by transporting heat horizontally. A classic example is the North Atlantic Drift, a continuation of the Gulf Stream, which carries relatively warm water toward north-west Europe and contributes to milder winters in the British Isles than would be expected for their latitude.

Seasonality arises from the tilt of the Earth’s axis. As the hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, it experiences summer: longer days and higher solar angle yield higher insolation and warmer temperatures. When present with other factors, such as ocean currents or altitude, seasonality produces the familiar patterns of temperate climates with distinct seasons and tropical climates with wet and dry seasons.

## Formation of precipitation and British weather systems
Precipitation occurs when air cools to its dew point and water vapor condenses into cloud droplets that grow into raindrops, snowflakes or other forms of precipitation. There are three principal mechanisms that produce precipitation relevant to the British Isles and many other regions: orographic (relief) rainfall, frontal rainfall and convectional rainfall. Orographic rainfall results when moist air is forced to rise over high ground; as it ascends it cools and drops precipitation on the windward slopes, producing the classic wet conditions in upland areas such as the Lake District and western Scotland. Frontal rainfall occurs where air masses of different temperatures meet; the warmer, lighter air is forced over the denser, colder air, producing extensive cloud and steady rain ahead of warm fronts and sharper, heavier rain along cold fronts. Convectional rainfall happens when the surface is heated strongly, causing localized rising thermals that produce cumuliform clouds and often intense thunderstorms in summer.

Mid-latitude depressions, or extratropical cyclones, are organised low-pressure systems that form along the polar front and are associated with converging air masses, fronts and a characteristic cloud and rain pattern. Anticyclones, by contrast, are high-pressure systems where air descends, warms and inhibits cloud formation, producing settled, dry conditions. In the British Isles, weather is commonly controlled by the passage and track of Atlantic depressions steered by the jet stream; when the jet stream lies to the south a series of depressions will bring unsettled, wet weather, while a strong, northerly anticyclone can bring prolonged dry and calm spells.

Interpreting synoptic charts and satellite imagery is an essential practical skill. Synoptic charts show isobars, areas of high and low pressure, and the positions of cold, warm and occluded fronts; tightly packed isobars indicate strong winds, and the orientation of fronts reveals the likely sequence of weather at a given location. Satellite images, especially visible and infrared bands, help identify cloud types and convection: towering cumulonimbus appears as bright, high cloud in visible imagery and very cold tops in infrared, while frontal cloud bands display a smoother, layered structure.

## Global weather phenomena: ENSO and tropical cyclones
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a coupled ocean–atmosphere phenomenon centred on the tropical Pacific that alters global weather patterns on timescales of months to years. During El Niño events, anomalously warm sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific weaken the normal east-to-west trade winds and shift convection eastward. This redistributes rainfall and can cause wetter conditions in parts of the eastern Pacific and drier conditions in the western Pacific and Australia. La Niña is the opposite phase, with strengthened trade winds and cooler central Pacific waters, often producing increased hurricane activity in the Atlantic and wetter conditions in parts of Australia and Southeast Asia. ENSO is a powerful example of teleconnection: a change in one region of the ocean–atmosphere system that produces climate effects thousands of kilometres away.

Tropical cyclones (called hurricanes in the North Atlantic and typhoons in the western Pacific) form over warm tropical oceans when sea surface temperatures exceed about 26.5°C and atmospheric conditions are favourable: abundant moisture, low vertical wind shear and some initial vorticity often provided by the trade wind disturbances. Warm, moist air rises and condenses, releasing latent heat that intensifies the system and causes further uplift; a clear eye surrounded by the most intense convection (the eyewall) can form in mature storms. Wind speed classification varies by basin, but intensity depends on ocean heat content and environmental shear. The impacts from high winds, intense rainfall and especially storm surge can be catastrophic. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 highlighted how physical hazards interact with social vulnerability: storm surge and levee failures led to severe flooding in New Orleans, with disproportionate effects on poorer communities and issues in evacuation planning and post-disaster recovery. Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 produced an enormous storm surge that devastated parts of the central Philippines, emphasising the importance of early warning systems, evacuation routes, appropriate shelter and long-term land-use planning.

Management strategies for tropical cyclones include improved forecasting and warning systems, enforced building codes, coastal defence infrastructure, land-use zoning to avoid high-risk locations, and community preparedness programmes. No single approach eliminates risk; effective management combines engineering, policy and social measures aimed at reducing vulnerability and speeding recovery.

## Linking scales, climate change and future patterns
Local weather and global climate are part of a connected system. Changes in the global energy balance affect atmospheric circulation, which in turn alters regional weather patterns. There is evidence that a warming climate can change the behaviour of jet streams, potentially leading to slower-moving weather systems and more persistent extremes such as heatwaves or prolonged rainfall events. Warming oceans also influence cyclone intensity by increasing the heat available to storms, even if changes in frequency are harder to predict regionally. When answering synoptic or essay questions, make explicit these links across scales: describe the local mechanism, then explain which larger-scale circulation features or energy balance changes are driving or modulating that mechanism.

A useful classroom or revision approach is to always move from process to pattern to impacts. Start with the physical process (for example orographic uplift), explain how it produces a pattern (wet western uplands, rain shadow to the east), and then link that pattern to human or ecological consequences (microclimates for agriculture, flood risk management). This structure makes answers coherent and shows the synoptic thinking that A-level examiners reward.

## Exam technique
When tackling questions on weather, climate and atmospheric circulation, start by identifying the command word and scale required. For "describe" or "explain" questions, open with a clear definition of key terms and then sequence your answer from cause to effect, using named examples where appropriate to show place knowledge. For synoptic or evaluative tasks, explicitly link local processes to global circulation features and the energy balance. When interpreting synoptic charts, mention isobars, pressure centers, front types and the expected sequence of weather; when using satellite imagery, refer to cloud type, cloud-top temperature (if infrared) and any visible frontal cloud bands. In essays, make sure each paragraph develops a single idea and finishes with a short linking sentence that connects back to the question. Use case studies such as Hurricane Katrina or Cyclone Haiyan to illustrate impacts and management, and always evaluate the effectiveness of management measures rather than simply listing them.

Finally, in data or decision-making questions, spend the recommended time planning. For fieldwork or practical questions, be precise about methods and sampling, justify choices briefly, and discuss limitations and how they affect the conclusions. Quality of written communication matters: write legibly, use correct geographical terms, and structure longer answers with clear paragraphing. This combination of clear process explanation, appropriate examples and careful presentation will maximise the marks you can achieve.
