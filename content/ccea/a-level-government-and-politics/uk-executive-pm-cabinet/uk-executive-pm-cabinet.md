# UK Executive: Prime Minister, Cabinet and executive–legislature relations (A-level Government and Politics Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: what the executive is and why it matters
The executive is the branch of government responsible for making and implementing policy, running the public services and representing the country internationally. In the UK this responsibility is concentrated in the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and ministers who run departments, supported by the civil service. Studying the executive is central to understanding how political decisions are taken in practice, who holds real power, and how those actors are held to account by Parliament, the courts, the media and public opinion. Key recurring questions are whether the Prime Minister dominates decision-making, whether the Cabinet still matters as a collective decision-making body, and how effectively Parliament and other institutions constrain the executive.

## The Prime Minister: roles, powers and sources of authority
The Prime Minister is the head of government and the most visible political leader in the UK. Their formal authority rests on constitutional conventions and political realities rather than a single written constitution. The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the party with the majority in the House of Commons and is invited by the monarch to form a government. That position gives the Prime Minister important powers: appointing and dismissing ministers, setting the overall policy agenda, chairing (or at least convening) the Cabinet, determining ministerial responsibilities and representing the UK at the highest diplomatic and political level.

Beyond these formal powers, the Prime Minister also wields substantial informal and party-based authority. As party leader they can command party loyalty through patronage of ministerial posts and party machinery, shape legislative timetables, and use the platform of Number 10 to set the news agenda. The Prime Minister’s influence is reinforced by offices around them: the Prime Minister’s Office, the Cabinet Office and a close team of political advisers and special advisers. Over recent decades different occupants of Number 10 have used these instruments to varying effect: some have relied on a small inner circle and Downing Street advisers to drive policy, while others have worked more through formal Cabinet processes.

However, the Prime Minister’s powers are not absolute. They depend on a parliamentary majority (or coalition arrangements), the discipline and unity of their party, public support, and the capacity of other institutions—Parliamentary committees, the judiciary, devolved governments and the media—to hold the government to account. Legal and constitutional developments, such as the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (in force from 2011 until its repeal in 2022), also altered the Prime Minister’s control over dissolution and the timing of elections, showing how statutory change can constrain political practice.

## The Cabinet and ministerial government: collective and individual responsibility
The Cabinet is the collective body of senior ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, which coordinates government policy. Traditionally the Cabinet is where collective decisions are agreed and where the major departments’ interests are balanced. The doctrine of collective responsibility requires Cabinet ministers to support decisions in public; if they cannot, conventionally they must resign. Individual ministerial responsibility requires ministers to account for the conduct of their departments and, in serious cases of failure, to step down.

In practice, the strength and role of the Cabinet vary with the Prime Minister’s style, the political context and the personality of ministers. Some Prime Ministers have strengthened the Cabinet by using formal Cabinet committees and ensuring inclusive deliberation; others have circumscribed its role, preferring small advisory groups or relying on special advisers. Cabinet committees now handle much of the detailed work, while the full Cabinet meets less frequently, which can reduce the opportunity for broad-based debate. Nevertheless, Cabinet government remains important as the mechanism that distributes responsibility across ministers and can act as a check on unilateral action by the Prime Minister.

Ministers are supported by the civil service, whose senior officials provide continuity, technical expertise and impartial advice. The relationship between ministers and the civil service helps translate political decisions into policy and administration; it also shapes the capacity of the executive to implement programmes.

## Executive–legislature relations: dominance, accountability and scrutiny
The relationship between the executive and Parliament is central to British political life. Two contrasting pictures often appear in analysis. One portrays strong executive dominance: a majority government with effective party discipline can usually secure the passage of its legislative programme and control parliamentary timetables. In this view, the Commons can be reduced at times to a forum for legitimating executive choices, especially when the governing party enjoys a solid majority and the whips maintain cohesion.

The other picture emphasises the checks on executive power. Parliament holds tools of scrutiny and accountability: Prime Minister’s Questions, ministerial questions, debates, select committees and the legislative process itself, including committee stages and votes. Select committees in recent decades have grown in confidence and expertise, using inquiries and public evidence sessions to probe ministers and officials. The House of Lords, while unelected and constrained, can delay and revise legislation, prompting government reconsideration. Backbench rebellions can undo or reshape government plans when the parliamentary arithmetic is tight. The effectiveness of these constraints depends on context: a small majority, coalition government or a polarising issue can increase the legislature’s leverage; a large majority and party unity decrease it.

Executive dominance also has constitutional implications. Parliamentary sovereignty means Parliament has ultimate legal authority, but the confidence convention gives the government the right to govern if it retains the confidence of the Commons. Votes of no confidence, meaningful votes on specific measures, and mechanisms for early general elections all interact to structure the balance between executive initiative and legislative control.

## Constraints on the Prime Minister and Cabinet
Although powerful, the Prime Minister and Cabinet face multiple formal and informal constraints. Electoral accountability is a primary limit: poor public support, electoral defeat or the threat of losing seats in mid-term elections can force policy changes. Party management is another constraint; leaders must hold together parliamentary parties and manage factions, or risk resignations, rebellions or leadership challenges.

Legal constraints include the judiciary’s role in testing ministerial decisions through judicial review, ensuring that ministers act lawfully and within delegated powers. While courts do not generally substitute policy judgments for ministers, they can require lawful procedures and protect individual rights. Devolved governments add another layer: decisions affecting Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland often require consultation or produce political pushback if ignored. International obligations and treaties also constrain choices, and the civil service’s expertise and implementation capacity can limit what is politically feasible.

Media scrutiny and public opinion can pressure ministers to change course or to resign. Interest groups and organised civil society influence policy through lobbying, campaigns, and public mobilisation. Finally, internal conventions such as collective responsibility and established constitutional practices place normative limits on behaviour, although these conventions can evolve.

## Illustrative examples
Contemporary and recent history provides clear examples of how executive power operates and is constrained. The 2010–2015 Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition under David Cameron and Nick Clegg shows how coalition agreement and a partnership between parties can curtail Prime Ministerial freedom: policy compromises, shared cabinet posts and a written agreement shaped government action. The early 2000s illustrate ministerial accountability and high-stakes collective decisions: the decision to join the 2003 Iraq intervention led to resignations and intense parliamentary scrutiny, demonstrating limits on Cabinet silence and the political costs of controversial choices. Tony Blair’s premiership is often cited for the use of a tight inner circle of advisers and a strong centre in Downing Street, a pattern sometimes described as diminishing the formal Cabinet’s role; by contrast, Margaret Thatcher is remembered for personal dominance but also for decisive use of the Cabinet to push through policy. More recent events, including the 2016 EU referendum and its political aftermath, highlight how sudden political shocks and intra-party divisions can rapidly alter the balance between leader, Cabinet and Parliament, and can force changes of leadership.

These examples underline that the form of executive power is not fixed: institutional structures, political circumstances and individual leadership styles interact to produce different patterns of government.

## How the study links to wider concepts and comparative questions
Understanding the UK executive also helps with broader comparative analysis. Concepts such as presidentialisation (increasing concentration of power in the leader’s hands), centralisation versus collective cabinet government, and the role of party systems in shaping executive power are useful when comparing systems. Comparing the UK with systems that have written constitutions, separation of powers or different accountability mechanisms highlights how constitutional arrangements shape the executive’s behaviour and constraints. For instance, the UK’s reliance on conventions and parliamentary confidence produces different dynamics from a presidential system where fixed terms and separation of powers change incentives and checks.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and executive–legislature relations you should begin by making the question’s focus explicit: identify whether the question asks about the “extent” of power, the “effectiveness” of constraints, causes of change, or to evaluate a specific convention. For short response or knowledge questions use precise definitions and brief, factual examples. For longer, evaluative essays structure your argument clearly: start with a concise introduction that defines key terms and states a judged position, then develop balanced paragraphs that combine explanation, evidence and evaluation. Use relevant examples—historical events, leadership styles and institutional mechanisms—to illustrate points, and where appropriate draw on comparative insights to strengthen evaluation. Always weigh competing interpretations: for example, if arguing that the Prime Minister dominates the executive, acknowledge the ways Cabinet, Parliament, the courts and public opinion can and do impose limits. Conclude by summarising the argument and making a reasoned judgement that answers the question directly. Throughout, demonstrate political vocabulary and ensure clear, accurate written communication; where the exam paper includes source material, integrate it into your argument by explaining its relevance and limitations rather than simply paraphrasing.
