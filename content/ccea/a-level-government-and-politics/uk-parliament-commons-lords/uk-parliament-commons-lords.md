# UK Parliament: House of Commons and House of Lords functions (A-level Government and Politics Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview of the two Houses and their constitutional place
The UK Parliament consists of two chambers, the elected House of Commons and the largely appointed House of Lords, together with the Crown. Their relationship is shaped by law, long-standing conventions and political practice. The House of Commons is the primary democratic chamber: it is composed of Members of Parliament (MPs) elected in single-member constituencies and has the final say on most public policy, especially on finance and confidence issues. The House of Lords is a revising chamber made up of life peers, a small number of hereditary peers (92), and the 26 Lords Spiritual; its strength lies in expertise, deliberation and detailed amendment rather than in democratic legitimacy. The balance of power between the two houses has been shaped by statute and convention, most notably the Parliament Acts (1911 and 1949), which limit the Lords’ ability to block legislation, and the Salisbury Convention, which constrains the Lords from obstructing government bills based on a governing party’s election manifesto.

## Legislative function: how a bill becomes law in each House
Both Houses participate in the legislative process through a clearly structured set of stages: first reading, second reading, committee stage, report stage, third reading and consideration of amendments. In the Commons the committee stage is usually conducted by a Public Bill Committee or by a Committee of the Whole House for important measures; in the Lords it is frequently a Committee of the Whole House or a Grand Committee. The Commons has special constitutional dominance over financial matters: money bills can only be delayed by the Lords for up to one month under the Parliament Acts and the Commons initiates supply. For non-money public bills the Lords can delay enactment but not ultimately veto a government bill in most circumstances; if the Lords persistently reject a Commons bill, the Commons can invoke the Parliament Acts to secure Royal Assent without the Lords’ consent. This legislative architecture means the Commons is the decisive legislative authority in a system where democratic accountability is privileged, while the Lords often acts as a chamber of revision, using its time and expertise to amend and refine legislation.

## Representation and legitimacy: elected MPs vs appointed peers
Representation in the Commons is straightforward and democratically grounded: MPs represent geographic constituencies and are accountable to voters at regular general elections. That electoral link underpins the Commons’ claim to be the primary forum for political representation. The Lords, by contrast, represents experience, professional expertise and sectional perspectives rather than territorial constituencies. Life peers are appointed to bring particular knowledge, such as legal, scientific or business expertise, and crossbench peers are independent of party labels. This difference produces a persistent debate about legitimacy. Supporters of the Lords argue that its composition allows for thoughtful, less partisan scrutiny, while critics contend that an unelected chamber lacks democratic legitimacy and therefore should not exert influence over policy. The Salisbury Convention and the use of the Parliament Acts are two practical ways the system maintains a balance between effective scrutiny and democratic primacy.

## Scrutiny and holding the government to account
Scrutiny is a core function of both Houses but operates differently in each. The Commons scrutinises the Executive through mechanisms tied to democratic accountability: Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs), ministerial question times, urgent questions, adjournment debates and written questions force ministers to explain and defend policy in a public forum. Select committees, organised to shadow government departments, have become particularly powerful instruments of scrutiny. Since reforms that introduced elected chairs and greater resources, departmental select committees have held ministers and senior officials to account through inquiries, published reports and oral evidence sessions; governments are conventionally expected to respond to committee reports. The Lords scrutinises government action through detailed line-by-line consideration of legislation and through its own committee system. Lords committees frequently examine long-term and cross-cutting issues—such as constitutional change, EU-related matters (historically), science and technology, and the constitution—and can draw on the professional backgrounds of peers to produce substantial reports that influence public debate and can prompt government amendment. Where the Commons’ scrutiny is embedded within the immediacy of electoral politics, the Lords’ scrutiny is often more reflective and expert-led.

## Limits on effectiveness: executive dominance and party discipline
Despite formal powers, practical constraints can limit how effectively either House exercises its functions. The Commons is theoretically supreme, but when the governing party commands a strong parliamentary majority, party whips, collective responsibility and the centralised control of the legislative timetable mean that the Executive often dominates parliamentary business. This can reduce the scope for backbenchers to influence legislation or hold ministers to account. Conversely, when government majorities are small or when there is a coalition or minority government, Parliament’s hold over the Executive can be stronger, producing more significant backbench influence and higher success rates for amendments and defeats. The Lords’ effectiveness is limited by its lack of an electoral mandate and by statutory constraints: it cannot block money bills and can only delay other public bills for a limited time unless exceptional circumstances warrant more conflict. Nevertheless, the Lords routinely forces governments to rethink or redraft measures through persistent amendment and moral pressure; a notable example is the use of the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting Act 2004 after prolonged Lords opposition, illustrating both the Lords’ capacity to impede and the Commons’ ultimate primacy.

## Special roles and conventions: financial privilege, Salisbury, and judicial history
Several conventions and historical developments shape how each House functions. The financial privilege of the Commons, rooted in the notion that those who vote taxes should be elected, means that the Lords plays no meaningful role in initiating or obstructing supply. The Salisbury Convention, emerging in the mid-20th century, holds that the Lords will not defeat a government bill that was included in its election manifesto, a practice designed to respect the democratic mandate of the elected chamber. Until the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and the establishment of the Supreme Court in 2009, the House of Lords also housed the judicial Committee of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, which acted as the final court of appeal. The removal of judicial functions clarified the separation of powers, reinforcing the Lords’ legislative and revising role rather than judicial responsibility.

## Recent developments and debates about reform
The composition and role of the Lords remain subjects of recurring political debate. Proposals have ranged from modest changes, such as reducing the number of peers and ending automatic hereditary membership, to radical plans for a wholly or partially elected second chamber. Each reform option involves trade-offs between democratic legitimacy, expertise and independent scrutiny. Practical reforms in recent decades have included the introduction of life peerages as the dominant form of membership and the House of Lords Act 1999, which largely removed the hereditary peers. On the Commons side, procedural changes—such as the creation of the Backbench Business Committee and increased powers for select committees—have sought to rebalance power away from the Executive. For students it is important to recognise that the institutions are living; their powers and practices evolve through statute, convention and political pressure rather than being fixed.

## Evaluating effectiveness: strengths, weaknesses and evidence
When evaluating how well each House performs its functions, it helps to weigh empirical evidence and to be precise about which function is under consideration. The Commons is strong on democratic legitimacy, decision-making authority and representation, and it is indispensable for holding government to account in formal terms. However, executive dominance and tight party discipline can undermine detailed scrutiny and reduce the influence of individual MPs. The Lords is valuable for its technical revision of legislation, specialist committee work and ability to think long-term beyond electoral cycles, but its unelected character challenges its moral authority to shape contentious policy. Evidence of effectiveness can be found in select committee reports that prompt policy changes, in Lords amendments that improve statutory clarity, and in moments when a minority government or a large rebellion in the Commons forces policy change. A balanced assessment will accept that both Houses have complementary roles: the Commons provides democratic mandate and final authority, while the Lords supplies expertise and reflective scrutiny.

## Exam technique
In answering exam questions on the functions of the House of Commons and House of Lords, begin by defining key terms such as representation, legislation and scrutiny, and state clearly which House you are discussing. Use the legislation and conventions that structure power—chiefly the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the Salisbury Convention and the financial privilege of the Commons—to frame your argument. Employ concrete examples to illustrate points, for instance cases where Lords amendments altered government bills, or where Commons rebellions and select committee inquiries influenced policy. When asked to evaluate effectiveness, structure your answer around clear criteria (democratic legitimacy, legal authority, capacity for scrutiny and impact on policy) and weigh strengths and weaknesses for each House. Make direct comparisons where required and explicitly address the command words of the question: explain, assess, evaluate, or contrast. Always plan a concise introduction, develop balanced analytical paragraphs with evidence and explanation, and finish with a conclusion that directly answers the question and reflects on implications or possible reforms. Time your responses to allow for planning and revision, and practise writing synoptic answers that draw on related material from other parts of the syllabus, such as the role of the Executive or the impact of pressure groups, to maximise AO2 and AO3 marks.
