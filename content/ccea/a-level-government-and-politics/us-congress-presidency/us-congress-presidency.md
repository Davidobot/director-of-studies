# US government: Congress, presidency and checks on power (A-level Government and Politics Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Constitutional framework: separation of powers and the logic of checks and balances
The US Constitution establishes a system of separated powers among three branches—legislative, executive and judicial—with explicit and implicit checks designed to prevent any single branch from becoming dominant. The Founding Fathers wrote a written constitution that assigns enumerated powers to Congress, sets out the presidency with distinct responsibilities, and creates an independent judiciary. Separation of powers refers to the allocation of functions across branches, while checks and balances refers to the specific mechanisms—veto, advice and consent, impeachment, judicial review, control of the purse, treaty ratification and so on—that enable each branch to limit the others. In practice this system produces a dynamic of competition and cooperation: it can produce gridlock when branches are controlled by different parties, yet it also forces compromise and institutional restraint. Understanding how these formal rules interact with political realities—party politics, public opinion, partisan polarisation, and institutional norms—is essential to explaining both the strengths and weaknesses of American constitutional government.

## Congress: structure, functions and internal organisation
Congress is the bicameral legislature of the United States, composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House is designed to represent the population, with membership apportioned by population and two-year terms that make representatives responsive to electoral pressures. The Senate represents states equally, with two senators per state serving six-year staggered terms to provide stability and a degree of insulation from short-term politics. Both chambers exercise the core legislative functions of representation, law-making and scrutiny, but they also have distinctive constitutional roles: the House originates revenue bills and has the sole power to impeach federal officials, while the Senate tries impeachments and wields the unique powers of advice and consent over presidential appointments and treaty ratification.

Congressional work is organised through committees and subcommittees that specialise in policy areas, develop legislation, hold hearings, and conduct oversight. Committee chairs and party leaders shape the legislative agenda, and rules in each chamber determine how bills proceed. Procedural tools, such as the House Rules Committee and the Senate’s filibuster and cloture mechanisms, strongly influence legislative outcomes; the filibuster in particular has historically allowed a minority in the Senate to delay or block legislation, although changes to filibuster rules for nominations illustrate how internal practices can be altered by majority parties. Examples of Congress exercising its powers include the passage of major social legislation, frequent use of investigatory hearings during scandals, and the budgeting power that ultimately constrains executive policy.

## The presidency: roles, powers and limits
The President occupies a unique constitutional position as head of state, head of government, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and chief executive charged with enforcing the laws. Formal powers include the ability to sign or veto legislation, to act as commander-in-chief during military operations, to negotiate treaties (subject to Senate ratification), to make appointments to the federal judiciary and senior executive positions (with Senate confirmation), and to give the State of the Union and other policy messages to Congress. Beyond enumerated powers, presidents exercise significant informal powers: the "bully pulpit" to shape public opinion, executive orders and presidential memoranda to direct the bureaucracy, executive agreements to conduct foreign policy without Senate treaty ratification, and an agenda-setting role that can mobilise Congress or public support.

Presidential power is limited in several ways. The veto can be overridden by two-thirds majorities in both chambers; appointments and treaties require Senate approval; the power of the purse gives Congress leverage through appropriations and authorisations; statutory limits and judicial review constrain executive action; and electoral accountability, public opinion and media scrutiny all shape presidential behaviour. Important historical cases illustrate constitutional limits: United States v. Nixon (1974) restricted claims of absolute executive privilege, and the War Powers Resolution of 1973 attempted to limit the President’s unilateral military commitments—though tensions over it persist. The presidency can become especially powerful during crises, when the public often grants the executive wider latitude, but institutional checks typically reassert themselves over time.

## Congress–presidency relations: cooperation, conflict and examples
Relations between Congress and the President range from co-operation and policy partnership to sharp conflict and oversight battles. When one party controls both the executive and both chambers of Congress (a unified government), presidents generally find it easier to advance their legislative agenda. By contrast, divided government—when different parties control the White House and at least one chamber—often leads to legislative stalemate, strategic use of vetoes, and heightened oversight. High-profile examples help to show how these dynamics work. The impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998 demonstrated the House’s power to impeach and the Senate’s role in trying and ultimately acquitting him. The Watergate investigations of the early 1970s show how congressional oversight, supported by an independent judiciary, can expose executive wrongdoing and produce political consequences. More recently, the impeachments of President Donald Trump in 2019–2020 and 2021, and the subsequent Senate trials, again illustrate the political as well as constitutional character of impeachment: it is a remedy intended for "high crimes and misdemeanours," but outcomes depend heavily on Senate composition and partisan calculations.

Congressional oversight operates through hearings, investigations, subpoenas, budget controls and even the power to create and abolish agencies. Oversight can be routine and policy-focused, but it can also be a tool for partisan accountability. The interplay between persuasion and coercion—between the president’s ability to mobilise public opinion and Congress’s institutional levers—shapes policy outcomes and the balance of power.

## The judiciary and judicial review as a check on executive and legislative power
The federal judiciary, and especially the Supreme Court, plays a central role in interpreting the Constitution and reviewing the actions of the other branches. Although judicial review is not explicitly written into the Constitution, the landmark Supreme Court decision in Marbury v. Madison (1803) established the Court’s authority to declare legislative and executive acts unconstitutional. Since then, the judiciary has constrained both Congress and the President; notable examples include Brown v. Board of Education (1954) in the sphere of civil rights, and United States v. Nixon (1974) which limited executive privilege during criminal investigations.

Courts provide a legal check by hearing cases that challenge the constitutionality of statutes, executive actions and administrative regulations. The independence of the judiciary is secured through life tenure for federal judges and the Senate's advice and consent role for appointments, but judicial power is also indirect: courts rely on the executive and states to enforce decisions, and the scope of judicial review can be limited by doctrines such as standing, mootness and justiciability. Furthermore, the composition of the Court—shaped by presidential nominations and Senate confirmations—affects long-term legal trajectories, as recent confirmation battles show.

## Other checks on presidential power: elections, federalism, institutions and public accountability
Beyond the formal checks of Congress and the courts, multiple informal and structural checks constrain the presidency. Elections are the ultimate democratic check: both presidential elections and midterm congressional contests can curtail or endorse presidential agendas. Federalism, by dispersing power to state governments, creates competitive arenas that can resist or adapt federal policies, as seen in state-level litigation over federal immigration, environmental and health measures. Bureaucratic institutions and career civil servants can moderate or delay presidential directives, while administrative law, Congressional oversight of agencies, and the inspector-general system add accountability within the executive branch.

Civil society—including the media, interest groups and social movements—acts as an important public check. Investigative journalism and public mobilisation can transform alleged abuses into political crises that force congressional inquiry or judicial action. Lobbying and interest-group influence also shape how Congress exercises its powers and how administrations craft policy. Finally, norms and conventions—such as the expectation of presidential transparency, bipartisan cooperation on certain matters, and restraint in emergency powers—play a significant role: when norms erode, formal checks become even more important, but political consequences may be slower to follow.

## Teaching and contextual examples useful for revision
To make the constitutional principles concrete, anchor discussions in well-chosen historical and contemporary cases. Marbury v. Madison is indispensable for illustrating judicial review, while United States v. Nixon and the Watergate hearings powerfully demonstrate how checks can curb presidential excess. The War Powers Resolution and subsequent military engagements illuminate tensions between commander-in-chief authority and congressional war powers. The Senate’s advice and consent role is tangible in confirmation battles such as Robert Bork in 1987, and more recent Supreme Court confirmations where filibuster rules were altered. Congressional oversight is visible in the Iran‑Contra hearings, the 2001–2006 investigations into the run-up to the Iraq War, and the House select committee investigations into the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Use these cases to show both the legal mechanics and the political calculations underpinning checks and balances. Encourage students to connect institutional rules to partisan incentives and to weigh the difference between legal constraints and political effects.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions, begin by defining key terms and briefly outlining the constitutional framework relevant to the question. For AO1 responses, demonstrate clear, accurate factual knowledge of institutional powers and procedures. For analysis and evaluation (AO2 and AO3), move beyond description: explain how formal powers operate in practice, use specific examples or cases to illustrate points, and assess strengths and limitations. Balance your argument by considering counterarguments and by weighing competing explanations—constitutional text, political parties, public opinion, institutional norms and historical contingencies. Structure extended answers with a clear line of argument and signpost transitions, so conclusions follow logically from the evidence presented. Use precise political vocabulary (for example, "advice and consent," "filibuster," "judicial review," "power of the purse," "impeachment") and integrate at least one or two illustrative examples for higher marks. In comparative questions, explicitly contrast institutional features (for instance, the Senate’s treaty role versus the UK’s royal prerogative historically exercised by ministers) and be careful to link comparisons back to the question. Manage time so that longer evaluation questions receive sufficient depth, and always end with a concise conclusion that answers the question directly.
