# UK Judiciary and judicial review (A-level Government and Politics Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: the judiciary’s place in the UK constitution
The UK judiciary is a core institution in the uncodified British constitution, charged with applying the law, interpreting statutes and protecting individual rights against unlawful state action. Unlike elected branches of government, judges are intended to be independent and impartial so that disputes about the legality of government action can be resolved fairly. Judicial review is the principal legal mechanism by which courts scrutinise the actions of ministers, civil servants and public bodies. It is not an appeal on the merits of a political decision, but a review of whether a decision was taken lawfully and by the correct procedures. Understanding how judicial review works, what limitations it faces, and how it interacts with constitutional principles such as parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law is essential for A-level study of government and politics.

## Structure of the courts and safeguards for independence
The senior UK courts form a hierarchy in which important constitutional and public law questions are resolved. The Supreme Court sits at the top as the final appellate court for most domestic matters. Below it are the Court of Appeal and the High Court, where most public law and judicial review claims are decided at first instance and on appeal. Judges in these courts benefit from legal protections designed to secure their independence: they are appointed through an independent commission, have security of tenure, and receive salaries that cannot be reduced while in office. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 was a landmark change that further separated judicial power from political institutions by creating the Supreme Court and establishing an independent Judicial Appointments Commission. These structural protections aim to ensure that judges can make decisions without improper political pressure.

## What judicial review does and the main legal grounds
Judicial review allows courts to examine whether a public decision, policy or omission complies with the law. It focuses on the legality of the decision-making process, not on whether the court thinks the decision was right on policy grounds. The familiar legal grounds for judicial review are illegality, procedural impropriety, and irrationality. Illegality covers decisions that exceed the legal powers conferred on the decision-maker, where an authority acts beyond its powers or misconstrues the law. Procedural impropriety addresses failures to follow required procedures or to respect the rules of natural justice, such as the duty to consult affected parties or to give a fair hearing. Irrationality, sometimes called Wednesbury unreasonableness, applies where a decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have reached it. Over time common law principles and human rights considerations have sharpened and extended these grounds, giving the courts robust tools to scrutinise administrative action.

## Remedies, procedural access and practical limits
When a judicial review claim succeeds the court has several remedies available. A quashing order sets aside the unlawful decision; a prohibiting order prevents a decision-maker from acting unlawfully in the future; a mandatory order compels a public body to perform a duty; declarations state the legal position; and injunctions may restrain actions pending further litigation. Despite these powers, access to judicial review is subject to procedural constraints. Claimants must show a sufficient interest or standing to bring the case and must bring proceedings promptly. There are also cost and legal-aid considerations that affect who can realistically take cases. In addition, certain matters are treated as non-justiciable where the courts consider them inappropriate for judicial determination because they involve high policy judgement, national security, or pure matters of political discretion. Parliament can limit review by statute in some areas, although courts will often scrutinise such limits closely to preserve fundamental rights unless the legislation is explicit.

## The judiciary’s role in holding the Executive to account: examples and significance
Judicial review, together with other judicial tools, performs an important constitutional check on the Executive. Courts can require ministers and public bodies to act within the law, to follow fair procedures and to respect rights recognised by law. Recent high-profile constitutional litigation illustrates this role. In cases concerning the process for leaving the European Union and the limits of prerogative powers, the courts ruled that the government could not trigger major constitutional changes without parliamentary approval. Another prominent case established that a government’s prorogation of Parliament was unlawful when it had the effect of frustrating parliamentary scrutiny. These rulings demonstrate how courts can enforce legal constraints on executive action and uphold constitutional processes. At the same time, many judicial review cases operate at a lower profile, challenging decisions on immigration, local planning, social care and regulatory enforcement; cumulatively these cases shape how public services are delivered and how rights are protected.

## Tensions, criticisms and constitutional limits
The judiciary’s active role in reviewing executive power has prompted debate about legitimacy and the proper limits of judicial intervention. Critics argue that judges are unelected and may overstep by substituting legal judgments for political choices, thereby undermining democratic accountability. Supporters counter that judicial review enforces the rule of law, prevents abuse of power and protects minorities against majoritarian excess. Constitutional limits also restrict judicial power in practice. The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty means that courts cannot strike down primary legislation; they can only interpret statutes and, where relevant, issue a declaration of incompatibility under the Human Rights Act 1998, leaving the political branches to decide whether to amend the law. The courts are also constrained by doctrines of justiciability, by statutory ouster clauses that may limit review, and by practical issues such as standing and costs. Changes in government policy, reforms to judicial appointments, or shifts in parliamentary statute can alter the balance of power, so the relationship between the judiciary and the other branches remains dynamic and contested.

## The Human Rights Act, declarations and international law influences
The Human Rights Act 1998 brought European Convention rights into domestic law, giving UK courts a direct means to consider human rights when conducting judicial review. Under the Act, courts may issue a declaration of incompatibility where primary legislation conflicts with protected rights, signalling to Parliament that reform is needed while leaving the final political choice to legislators. This mechanism illustrates the subtle constitutional balance: courts can identify legal conflicts and constrain administrative action, but ultimate constitutional change remains the preserve of Parliament. International law and supranational influences have also shaped judicial reasoning, though the post-Brexit era has introduced new complexities. The courts continue to interpret statutes in light of international obligations where Parliament intends that result, and human rights jurisprudence remains an important resource for judges assessing executive conduct.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the judiciary and judicial review, begin by setting out clear definitions and the constitutional context: explain what judicial review is, what the courts may and may not do, and why judicial independence matters. Use precise legal and political vocabulary—terms such as illegality, procedural impropriety, irrationality, quashing order, justiciability and parliamentary sovereignty show command of the topic. Illustrate points with well-chosen examples: for instance, refer to cases where courts checked prerogative power or required parliamentary involvement in major decisions, and describe how the Human Rights Act allows declarations of incompatibility. For evaluative essays, balance benefits and limitations: consider both the importance of the courts in protecting rights and enforcing legality and the democratic concerns about unelected judges making decisions with political consequences. Analyse the practical constraints on judicial review, including standing, time limits, costs and statutory limitations, and explain how these affect access to justice. In longer answers, structure your response so that each paragraph advances an argument—start with a claim, support it with explanation and evidence, and consider a counter-argument before linking back to the question. End with a concise judgement that weighs the evidence you have discussed and answers the question directly. Finally, practice applying these analytical techniques to past-style questions so you can integrate factual knowledge, legal principles and political evaluation under timed conditions.
