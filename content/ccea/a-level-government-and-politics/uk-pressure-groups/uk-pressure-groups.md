# Pressure groups in the UK: types, tactics and impact (A-level Government and Politics Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## What is a pressure group and why they matter
Pressure groups are organisations formed to influence public policy and political decision-making without seeking to be elected as a party. They range from tightly organised professional associations representing specific occupational interests to loose social movements campaigning for broad cultural change. Pressure groups matter because they are one of the principal channels through which citizens, experts and interest-holders seek to shape government action between elections. They can supply expertise to ministers and select committees, mobilise public opinion, mount legal challenges, and sometimes change the agenda of Parliament and the Executive. In studying pressure groups for A-level Government and Politics you should be clear about the different ways they interact with the state, and how their influence is judged: by concrete policy wins, by shaping debate, or by blocking measures.

## Types of pressure groups
Pressure groups are usefully categorised in several overlapping ways. Sectional groups represent and protect the interests of a defined group of people, such as trade unions or professional associations; the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) or the British Medical Association (BMA) are examples that pursue material benefits or regulatory outcomes for members. Cause groups campaign on issues that are presented as public goods or moral imperatives rather than narrow self-interest; Greenpeace and the RSPCA are familiar cause groups lobbying on environmental and animal welfare issues respectively. Insider groups are those with regular, privileged access to ministers, civil servants and parliamentary committees; they tend to operate behind the scenes and use expertise and contacts to influence policy. Outsider groups lack regular access and rely on publicity, direct action or public mobilisation to apply pressure; campaigning charities and radical environmental groups often fall into this category. Finally, social movements — historically important examples include the suffragettes — are broader, less institutionalised forces that can reshape political norms and policy over long periods. Understanding these categories helps when you assess tactics and likely effectiveness, because resources, public sympathy and access vary markedly between types.

## Tactics and methods of influence
Pressure groups deploy a wide repertoire of tactics, chosen to suit their resources and goals. Insider groups will prioritise lobbying: meeting ministers, providing briefing papers, giving evidence to parliamentary committees and working through formal consultative processes. Expertise is a key currency here; specialist knowledge can make a group indispensable to policymakers. Outsider groups compensate for lack of privileged access by generating publicity and public mobilisation. This can include organised demonstrations, high-profile direct actions, carefully timed media campaigns, celebrity endorsements and social media pushes to create salience. Litigation has become an increasingly important tool: groups such as Liberty have used judicial review to challenge government action and thereby force policy reversals or clarifications. Research, reports and think-tank partnerships are long-term tactics that aim to change the policy conversation by supplying alternative frameworks and evidence. Fundraising and targeted constituency campaigns can influence MPs, while coalition-building with other organisations often amplifies impact. The choice of tactic is strategic: groups seeking a narrow regulatory change may quietly lobby officials, while those seeking cultural or legal transformations may need public campaigns and legal action.

## Why access matters: networks, resources and timing
A group’s influence depends on more than passion. Resources — money, staff, membership, technical expertise and insider contacts — determine what tactics are available. The political context matters too. Governments facing a fragile parliamentary majority, or a Prime Minister anxious about public opinion, are more likely to be responsive to well-timed campaigns. Policy communities and networks form around particular issues; groups that are embedded in these networks enjoy regular channels to advisers and civil servants. Institutional receptiveness is important: devolved institutions, select committees, and public consultations provide entry points. Conversely, issues framed as matters of national security or fiscal constraint may be closed to outside influence. Timing, such as feeding evidence into a select committee inquiry when a bill is under scrutiny, can make the difference between success and irrelevance. All these factors show why two groups campaigning on similar issues can have very different outcomes.

## Measuring impact: what counts as success
Judging the impact of pressure groups is complex because influence is multifaceted and often indirect. The most visible measure is instrumental success: a group secured a change in law or policy, for example the Snowdrop campaign’s influence on the firearms legislation after the Dunblane tragedy, or sustained campaigning that contributed to the 2007 public smoking bans. Equally important are agenda-setting effects: a group that forces an issue onto the public and parliamentary agenda has shaped the political conversation even if immediate policy change does not follow. Other forms of impact include symbolic wins, shifts in public opinion, successful prevention of government action, or judicial victories that set legal precedents. Long-term cultural change, such as the role that pressure groups like Stonewall played in normalising LGBT rights and contributing to the passage of same-sex marriage legislation, illustrates how effects may accumulate slowly. When assessing impact in essays, distinguish between direct causal influence and correlation, acknowledge time lags, and consider the counterfactual—what might have happened without the group’s activity.

## Democratic benefits and criticisms
Pressure groups contribute to democracy by representing interests, providing expertise, enhancing participation between elections and holding government to account. They can improve policy design by highlighting affected groups and offering technical know-how. However, important criticisms exist. Resource inequality means wealthy, well-connected groups can exert disproportionate influence, lending weight to a more elitist reading of politics. Insider access can make the policymaking process opaque and potentially unaccountable, while outsider tactics can be disruptive or polarising. Questions about legitimacy arise when unelected organisations shape public policy; transparency in funding and lobbying activity is a central democratic concern. There are also practical problems: overlapping or competing groups can create fragmentation and confusion for policymakers. The debate between pluralist defenders of a vibrant interest-group ecology and critics who emphasise elite capture or unequal influence is central to evaluation tasks in exams. Effective assessment weighs both the constructive roles groups play and the structural weaknesses that can undermine democratic equality.

## Teaching examples and signposts for essays
When teaching or revising, anchor theoretical points with concrete UK examples. Use the NFU and CBI to illustrate sectional/insider influence on agricultural and business policy, and the BMA to show how professional expertise can shape health policy and industrial action dynamics. Cite Snowdrop and the post-Dunblane firearms legislation for a tightly focused campaign that produced rapid legal change, and Stonewall for a long-term cultural transformation leading to legislative reform. Use Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion to contrast mainstream environmental advocacy with more disruptive outsider tactics. Always connect examples to concepts: show how insider status, expert credibility, mass membership or disruptive capacity explain tactics and outcomes. When comparing interpretations, deploy pluralist and elitist frameworks, and bring in evidence about resources, public support, and institutional arrangements to support balanced conclusions.

## Exam technique
In answering questions on pressure groups make sure you define key terms early and precisely; for example, explain what you mean by a pressure group, by insider/outsider status, and by measures of impact. For short answer and AO1-style questions provide clear, focused knowledge with an illustrative example. For AO2 and AO3 responses structure essays with a short introduction that sets out the argument, a series of analytical paragraphs that each develop a single point and include concrete examples, and a conclusion that evaluates the extent of your argument. When asked to “assess” or “evaluate” make explicit comparisons between competing interpretations, such as pluralist versus elitist explanations, and weigh the evidence; do not simply describe tactics. Use timing and institutional context to explain why the same tactic might work in one case but not another. If a source is provided in the exam, integrate it into your argument: use it as evidence, criticise its limitations, and relate it to wider knowledge. Manage time by planning briefly before writing, allocate more time to extended essays, and aim for coherence and clarity in writing—accurate political vocabulary and logical sequencing contribute to AO3. Finally, always end with a succinct judgement that addresses the question’s focus—this demonstrates critical evaluation and helps secure top marks.
