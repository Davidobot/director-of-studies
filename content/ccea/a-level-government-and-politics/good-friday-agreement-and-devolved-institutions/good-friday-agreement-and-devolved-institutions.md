# Good Friday Agreement and devolved institutions (A-level Government and Politics Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Introduction: what the Good Friday Agreement achieved
The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 (also known as the Belfast Agreement) was a landmark political settlement that transformed the governance of Northern Ireland. It brought an end to large-scale violence and provided a new constitutional and institutional framework based on consent, power‑sharing and cross‑community cooperation. For students of Government and Politics the Agreement is important because it created devolved institutions — principally the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive — whose design, operation and durability are central topics for study. The Agreement established principles that continue to shape Northern Irish politics: that any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland must be by consent, that there should be parity of esteem between unionist and nationalist identities, and that political institutions should protect both majority rule and minority rights through mechanisms for cross‑community decision making.

## The institutional architecture created by the Agreement
The Good Friday Agreement created a multi‑layered architecture of governance. The central features for classroom study are the Northern Ireland Assembly, a devolved, unicameral legislature, and the Northern Ireland Executive, a power‑sharing cabinet drawn from parties in the Assembly. Complementary bodies include the North/South Ministerial Council to manage cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and the British–Irish Council to facilitate wider cooperation among the governments and devolved administrations of the islands. The Agreement was not a simple transfer of power from Westminster; it combined devolved competency over many areas such as health, education and local government with continuing UK sovereignty and a role for Westminster in areas such as constitutional change, security and reserved matters. The Agreement also contained provisions on human rights, policing reform and decommissioning, reflecting its broad ambition to address the causes as well as the symptoms of conflict.

## The Northern Ireland Assembly: representation, legislation and scrutiny
The Assembly was designed to carry out three principal functions: representation, legislation and scrutiny. Representation is distinctive because members are elected by proportional representation and the Assembly’s procedures encourage cross‑community involvement; this seeks to reflect Northern Ireland’s divided society and to give both unionist and nationalist communities a voice. In law and practice, legislation in devolved areas is produced by the Assembly, subject to parity with human rights obligations and some limits imposed by Westminster. The scrutiny role is carried out through committee systems and question times, intended to hold ministers and the Executive to account. However, the institutional mechanisms for cross‑community voting — notably designations of MLAs as unionist, nationalist or other, and the use of weighted or cross‑community support in key votes — mean that simple majoritarianism is tempered by the need to build support across identity lines. This consociational element helps prevent the tyranny of a single majority but can also complicate decision making.

## The Executive and the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister
The Executive is the devolved government of Northern Ireland and operates on a power‑sharing, consociational basis. Ministers are allocated through a combination of appointment by the largest parties and a system of ministerial allocation that was later refined so that significant parties take cabinet positions in proportion to their electoral strength. At the head of the Executive sit the First Minister and deputy First Minister whose offices are co‑equal in status: their joint working symbolises the requirement that the principal communities govern together. The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) acts as a coordinating department, handling cross‑cutting policy and community relations. The Executive’s powers include policy making and administration in devolved fields, but its effectiveness depends on political willingness to cooperate, the capacity of ministers, and the stability of inter‑party relationships. The mandatory coalition nature of the Executive ensures shared responsibility, but it also introduces vulnerabilities when parties withdraw from government, as happened during several periods of suspension.

## Party politics and electoral change since 1998
The party landscape in Northern Ireland has evolved significantly since the Agreement. Traditional dominant parties such as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) declined as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) rose to prominence on the unionist side, while Sinn Féin consolidated and increased its electoral support among nationalists. Alliance and other cross‑community parties grew slowly, reflecting some public appetite for non‑sectarian politics. These shifts are important when analysing the functioning of devolved institutions because the composition and strategic aims of parties shape both coalition dynamics and the prospects for stable government. For example, the emergence of Sinn Féin as a major nationalist party committed to republican goals but participating fully in institutions created under the Agreement has been central to the success of the settlement, while the DUP’s earlier scepticism and later pragmatic engagement illustrate how parties can alternate between opposition and government roles.

## Assessing effectiveness and independence: strengths and weaknesses of devolved government
When judging the effectiveness of the Assembly and the Executive students must weigh multiple dimensions. On one hand, the institutions have delivered normalised politics in many policy areas, enabling locally accountable decisions on health, education and transport and giving citizens routes for representation and redress. They have also institutionalised mechanisms for inter‑community dialogue and created forums for North‑South cooperation, which have reduced tensions and promoted practical collaboration.

On the other hand, the institutions have faced repeated crises. The Assembly and Executive were suspended by Westminster in 2002 because of collapse in trust between parties; later periods of deadlock and ministerial resignations led to further suspensions and protracted negotiations. Mechanisms intended to protect minorities, such as the petition of concern, have sometimes been used in ways critics argue amount to political vetoes, hindering reform on issues like same‑sex marriage until later UK or wider developments shifted political calculations. The question of independence from the Executive is also important: although the Assembly has formal scrutiny powers, party discipline, the centrality of the Executive in policy initiation, and the need for cross‑party consensus can limit effective challenge. The relationship with Westminster remains significant; ultimate sovereignty rests with the UK Parliament, which can legislate for Northern Ireland and has intervened during suspensions. The courts and human rights obligations provide additional checks, but they work within a complex constitutional environment where political as much as legal solutions matter.

## Subsequent agreements and ongoing reform
The Good Friday Agreement has not been static. Subsequent agreements and political packages have amended and refined the institutions to respond to crises and changing political realities. Notable developments include the St Andrews Agreement of 2006, which addressed disputes over ministerial appointments and streamlined the path to devolution’s restoration; the Hillsborough Castle talks and Fresh Start Agreement that dealt with decommissioning, welfare reform, and budgetary issues; and the New Decade, New Approach agreement in 2020 which restored the institutions after a three‑year collapse and included measures on language, legacy, and investment. These adjustments show that the Agreement is best understood as a living political settlement: successful governance depends on ongoing negotiation and willingness to adapt. Students should be prepared to discuss how amendments and new deals have altered institutional behavior and public confidence, and to evaluate whether such piecemeal change strengthens or undermines long‑term stability.

## Teaching points and useful examples for essays
When preparing essays it helps to have a set of concrete examples and clear concepts. Use the 2002 suspension to illustrate a breakdown in trust and how Westminster reserved powers can be re‑exercised. Refer to the 2007 restoration of devolved government to show how negotiated compromise and external facilitation can revive institutions. The tightening of ministerial allocation and changes to the petition of concern procedure are useful for discussing reforms intended to prevent abuse of minority protections. Elections in 2003, 2011 and 2017 highlight party realignments: the growth of Sinn Féin and the DUP’s rise to dominance, followed by later volatility, are central to any analysis of why power‑sharing can be both resilient and fragile. Use New Decade, New Approach to demonstrate contemporary problem solving and the continuing role of UK and Irish governments as guarantors. Throughout, be explicit about how principles such as consociationalism, parity of esteem and consent underpin institutional design and practice.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on the Good Friday Agreement and devolved institutions requires clear organisation, accurate knowledge and balanced evaluation. Start short answers by defining key terms such as power‑sharing, devolved competence or cross‑community vote, and then apply these terms to the specific question. For longer essays, plan a clear line of argument with an introduction that sets out your definition, the criteria you will use to judge effectiveness, and a brief roadmap. Develop each paragraph around one idea: explain the institutional feature or event, provide illustrative evidence (for example dates of agreements, suspensions, or election results) and analyse its significance. Always move from description to analysis and then to evaluation; examiners look for AO1 knowledge, AO2 analysis and AO3 coherent argument, so make sure you address all three. Use comparative or synoptic links where appropriate — for instance, comparing the Assembly’s scrutiny role with Westminster’s parliamentary scrutiny helps show deeper understanding. Where source material is provided in an exam, integrate it critically: use it to support your points but evaluate its perspective and limitations. Finish with a balanced conclusion that answers the question directly, weighs strengths and weaknesses, and, if asked, offers a judgement. Time management is vital: allocate minutes according to marks, leave time to plan and to proofread for clarity and quality of written communication.
