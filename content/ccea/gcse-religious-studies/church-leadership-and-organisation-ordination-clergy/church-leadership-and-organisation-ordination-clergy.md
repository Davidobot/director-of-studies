# Church leadership and organisation (ordination, clergy) (GCSE Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: what we mean by church leadership and ordination
Church leadership and ordination refer to how Christian communities choose, train and authorise people to lead worship, teach, care for congregations and represent the church in public life. Ordination is the formal act that marks someone as a member of the clergy; it is understood and practised in different ways across Christian traditions. In some churches ordination is described as a sacrament that continues the authority of the apostles, while in others it is a commissioning or public recognition of a person called to serve. Understanding these differences helps explain why churches are organised the way they are, how worship is led, and how decisions are taken about doctrine and social issues.

## Catholic leadership: hierarchy, ordination and the role of the priest
In the Catholic Church leadership follows a clearly defined hierarchical structure that moves from local communities to a global authority. At the local level parishes are served by priests; parishes are grouped into dioceses overseen by bishops; bishops gather in conferences and ultimately acknowledge the Pope as the bishop of Rome and spiritual leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. Ordination in the Catholic Church is part of the Sacrament of Holy Orders and is understood as a divinely instituted action that confers a spiritual character on the ordained person. The three orders within Holy Orders are deacon, priest and bishop. A bishop is the ordinary minister of ordination for priests and deacons, and bishops are believed to stand in apostolic succession, a continuous line of ministry traced back to the apostles.

The role of the priest is central in Catholic worship and sacramental life. Priests preside at the Mass, consecrate the bread and wine in the Eucharist, hear confessions in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, anoint the sick, baptise, and provide pastoral care. In the Latin (Western) Catholic tradition, priests are normally expected to remain celibate, although there are historic and contemporary exceptions. The Catholic Church does not ordain women to the priesthood, a point of important difference with many Protestant churches. Training for Catholic clergy typically takes place in seminaries where theology, pastoral care, liturgy and scripture are studied over several years before ordination.

## Protestant leadership: variety of structures and meanings of ordination
Protestant churches are not a single organisation and so their leadership structures vary widely. Some denominations, such as Anglicanism, retain a form of episcopal structure with bishops and dioceses and teach a form of apostolic succession. In the Church of England and many Anglican churches, ordination is a sacramental rite with bishops as ordaining ministers, but Anglicans and Catholics understand aspects of ordination differently. Other Protestant traditions, such as Presbyterianism, are governed by assemblies of elders and ministers rather than by bishops; ordination in these churches marks a person’s commissioning to ministry and is usually carried out by a council of elders or presbytery. Congregational churches place authority strongly within the local congregation, which calls and recognises its ministers.

Protestant theology introduced the idea of the “priesthood of all believers,” emphasising that all Christians have direct access to God and a calling to serve. This theological shift influenced attitudes to ordination: many Protestant churches see ordination less as a conferral of a special sacramental character and more as the church’s recognition and commissioning of a leader for teaching, preaching and pastoral oversight. Protestant churches tend to differ on who may be ordained. Many now ordain women and married people, while some evangelical and orthodox groups maintain different practices. Training for Protestant ministers often takes place at theological colleges or seminaries, and ordination services typically include vows, laying on of hands, and a commissioning prayer.

## Roles and responsibilities: what clergy do in worship, pastoral care and community life
Clergy carry responsibilities in worship, teaching, pastoral care and community leadership. In worship, clergy lead the congregation, set the tone of public services, preach on scripture and administer sacraments or ordinances. In churches with a liturgical tradition, such as the Catholic and many Anglican churches, the priest’s role in the Eucharist is central; the liturgy is laid out and follows a set form. In non-liturgical or less formal Protestant settings, ministers may focus more on preaching, Bible teaching and spontaneous prayer, and worship styles may include different musical and charismatic expressions.

Pastoral work includes visiting the sick, offering counselling, preparing people for marriage, baptism or funeral rites, and supporting families. Clergy also represent the church in the wider community: they engage in interfaith dialogue, work with charities, and lead local initiatives that promote social cohesion. Administrative duties are common too: overseeing parish finances, supporting lay leaders, planning services and maintaining church buildings. The role of deacons, elders, readers or lay ministers varies by tradition but is increasingly important as many churches share leadership with trained laypeople to respond to practical needs and to compensate for fewer full-time clergy.

## Worship, sacraments and the symbolic role of church furniture and buildings
Leadership and ordination are closely connected to how worship is understood. The Catholic Church celebrates seven sacraments, with the Eucharist and Baptism at the heart of communal life. For Catholics, priests act in persona Christi in the Eucharist, a theological expression meaning that in the liturgy the priest represents Christ to the people. Many Protestant churches observe two central rites, baptism and the Lord’s Supper (Communion), which they may call sacraments, ordinances, or acts of obedience depending on their theology. Views about Communion range from the Catholic doctrine of the real presence to Protestant understandings that see the bread and wine as symbols or as a spiritual presence.

Church architecture and furniture reflect theological priorities and aid worship. The altar or communion table signifies the place of offering and thanksgiving, the pulpit emphasises the importance of preaching, the lectern is used for scripture readings, and the baptismal font or pool marks entry into the Christian community. In Catholic churches, the tabernacle holds the consecrated bread and is treated with great reverence. Teaching about these items helps students understand how leadership, liturgy and belief shape physical space and practice.

## The church in contemporary society: challenges and changing leadership
Modern social change affects how churches lead and organise themselves. Declining church attendance in many parts of Europe has forced dioceses and denominations to rethink how they deploy clergy and use buildings. Debates about the ordination of women, the acceptance of LGBTQ+ clergy, and the blessing of same-sex unions have created significant tensions within and between denominations. At the same time, churches continue to play vital roles in education, healthcare, social services and disaster relief, often through charities connected to local parishes.

Clergy now operate in pluralist and often secular societies, requiring skills in interfaith engagement, public communication and pastoral care for people of many backgrounds. Many churches promote lay leadership, training readers, youth workers and volunteers to extend ministry beyond what paid clergy can achieve. Issues such as clerical abuse scandals, the need for safeguarding, and questions about financial transparency have increased calls for accountability and new models of leadership. These contemporary challenges provide rich material for classroom discussion about the continuing relevance and responsibilities of church leadership.

## Exam technique
When answering questions about church leadership and ordination in GCSE Religious Studies, begin by making clear which tradition you are discussing. Many questions require comparison, so explain how the Catholic understanding of Holy Orders differs from a Protestant view such as that of the Church of England, Presbyterian or Baptist traditions. Use specific vocabulary such as diocese, parish, bishop, priest, sacrament, ordination, apostolic succession, minister, pastor and priesthood of all believers. When asked to evaluate or analyse, show balanced reasoning: explain strengths and reasons for a belief, consider an opposing view, and then reach a supported judgement. For example, when discussing whether ordination should be reserved for men, present the theological reasons offered by both sides, consider pastoral and social implications, and conclude with a reasoned personal judgement supported by evidence.

In extended writing questions, organise your answer into clear paragraphs and aim to include a brief introduction, several developed paragraphs each focused on one point with supporting examples, and a concluding paragraph that answers the question directly. Refer where appropriate to practices or passages that illustrate the point, such as the Mass, the rite of ordination, or the Protestant emphasis on preaching, but avoid long quotations. If unsure which Protestant denomination to use in a comparative question, state your choice at the start and be consistent throughout. Finally, always link theology to practice: explain how ideas about ordination shape worship, pastoral care and the church’s public role, and use contemporary examples to show real-world relevance.
