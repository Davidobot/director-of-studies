# The Gospels (Matthew & Mark): identity, miracles and discipleship (GCSE Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: what these two Gospels aim to do
The Gospels of Matthew and Mark present overlapping but distinct portraits of Jesus, and both are central to questions about his identity, the meaning of his miracles, and what it means to be his disciple. For GCSE study you should see them both as theological narratives crafted for particular communities and purposes: Mark, the shortest and likely earliest Gospel, moves with urgency and emphasises Jesus’ actions and the cost of following him; Matthew shapes Jesus as the fulfiller of Jewish hopes and a teacher whose words form a new ethic for life. Reading the two together helps you recognise recurring themes (titles like Son of God and Son of Man, miracle stories, parables, the calling of the Twelve) while noting differences in emphasis and audience. Throughout, the texts link events and teaching to claims about who Jesus is and what God’s reign looks like.

## The identity of Jesus in Matthew and Mark
Both Gospels ask “Who is this?” and answer through a mixture of events, titles and public reactions. Important titles include Son of God, which highlights a divine relationship and authority; Messiah (or Christ), which draws on Jewish expectations of a promised deliverer; Son of Man, a figure with earthly and eschatological connotations; Son of David, a title that locates Jesus in the royal line of Israel; and Saviour, which signals rescue and restoration. Matthew tends to make these claims explicit with genealogy, fulfilment citations and episodes such as the visit of the Magi and Peter’s confession (for example, Peter’s declaration in Matthew 16). Mark presents identity through action and recognition: Jesus’ authority is shown in healing, exorcism and control of nature, and in moments like the calming of a storm and Peter’s declaration in Mark 8. Both Gospels include the Transfiguration, a scene that confirms Jesus’ unique status for his closest companions, and both include baptism scenes that frame his ministry as divinely authorised. Understanding identity means reading these events together: titles give theological names to what the stories demonstrate, and the varied responses—astonishment, fear, opposition—help readers grasp the implications of who Jesus is for his world.

## Miracles: what they do and key examples
Miracles function in these Gospels as signs that reveal the presence and character of God’s kingdom. They are not merely demonstrations of power; they show compassion, restore people to community and challenge religious and social expectations. There are three broad types of miracle narratives: healings (restoring bodily wholeness), exorcisms (expelling evil spirits), and nature miracles (calming storms, feeding crowds). Examples in Matthew include the cleansing of a leper (Matt. 8), the healing of a paralysed man (Matt. 9) and controversy over healing on the Sabbath (Matt. 12). Mark provides vivid accounts such as the casting out of an evil spirit in the synagogue (Mark 1), the intertwined stories of Jairus’ daughter and the woman with a haemorrhage (Mark 5), and the healing of a boy with an evil spirit (Mark 9). These episodes often provoke mixed reactions: crowds may marvel and follow, while religious leaders sometimes resist or accuse Jesus of wrongdoing. Literarily, miracle stories also function to build tension and to authenticate Jesus’ teaching: a healed person who praises God offers testimony to the truth of the kingdom that Jesus proclaims. Theologically, they point to God’s restorative action now and anticipate the full healing of creation. In classroom discussion it helps to explore both the immediate effect on the healed person and the wider challenge the miracle poses to existing structures—outsiders are welcomed back, ritual purity boundaries can be crossed, and Sabbath observance is reinterpreted in light of mercy.

## Teaching and the Kingdom: parables and instruction
Jesus’ miracles are closely linked to his teaching about the Kingdom of God, a core theme in both Gospels. He teaches through memorable sayings, ethical instruction and parables—short stories that invite listeners to think and decide. Matthew preserves extended teaching material, most famously the Sermon on the Mount, which sets out the characteristics of discipleship, attitudes to wealth, prayer, forgiveness and moral behaviour. Matthew’s parables (the Sower, the Weeds, the Workers in the Vineyard, the Wedding Feast) explore who belongs to the kingdom, how it grows and what justice looks like in God’s economy. Mark, while shorter on lengthy discourses, includes key parables too (the Sower, the Mustard Seed, the Growing Seed) and often pairs teaching with action: his readers see the kingdom announced and enacted. Both Gospels present discipleship as ethical formation: the Kingdom reshapes relationships, priorities and identity. For students, it is important to relate parables to everyday choices: the Sower asks what kind of “ground” our lives provide for God’s word; the Wedding Feast asks who is included or excluded and on what grounds; the Mustard Seed shows surprising growth from small beginnings. When answering exam questions, show how teaching and miracle narratives together form a coherent claim about God’s rule breaking into history.

## Discipleship: calling, demands and the cost of following
Discipleship is a central concern in both Matthew and Mark. Both Gospels narrate Jesus calling ordinary people—fishermen, a tax collector—to follow him (Matthew 4:18–22; Mark 1:16–20; Matthew 9:9; Mark 2:13–17). Becoming a disciple means being shaped by Jesus’ teaching and sharing in his mission, but it also carries demands and risks. Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount sets out the ethical standards expected of disciples: attitudes to anger, retaliation, prayer and wealth are redefined. Mark highlights the cost more starkly: disciples face misunderstanding, rejection and suffering; passages such as Mark 8:34–38 stress self-denial and the willingness to lose one’s life for the sake of the gospel. The narratives also show the weaknesses and pressures disciples face: Peter’s confession of faith is followed by misunderstanding and, later, denial; the pressure of discipleship appears in episodes where followers fall asleep in Gethsemane, lack faith during storms, or abandon Jesus at his arrest. Matthew concludes with a commissioning—often called the Great Commission—where Jesus sends his followers out with authority and promise, underscoring both responsibility and enduring presence. Teaching about discipleship in class should connect the historical setting (disciples as apprentices and itinerant companions) to contemporary questions about identity, belonging and ethical commitment in plural societies.

## Literary and historical context: why Matthew and Mark differ
Understanding differences between the two Gospels helps you explain why a passage appears differently in Matthew and Mark. Mark is widely regarded as the earliest Gospel and presents a compact, action-driven narrative with a sense of immediacy. It often preserves vivid, urgent scenes and a “Messianic secret” motif in which Jesus at times instructs silenced witnesses after miracles. Matthew, written for a community with Jewish roots, reshapes material to highlight fulfilment of scripture, teaching authority and community ethics. Matthew expands sayings, organizes teachings into large blocks (such as the Sermon on the Mount) and quotes Jewish scripture to show continuity with Israel’s story. Both authors shaped their sources to answer questions of their audiences: Who is Jesus? How should we live? What does God’s rule do to society? Historically, reading the texts in their Mediterranean first-century context clarifies why certain healings or controversies would challenge social norms—purity laws, marginalisation of ill people, and the authority of religious leaders were real issues. For exam answers, comparing a miracle or a teaching in both Gospels is a strong way to demonstrate understanding of genre, purpose and theological emphasis.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on identity, miracles and discipleship, aim to show both secure knowledge (AO1) and thoughtful evaluation (AO2). Begin answers with a clear statement that directly addresses the question, then use specific examples from Matthew and Mark to support your points—for example, name a miracle and give its Gospel reference and significance. Explain what the passage would have meant in its original context and how it contributes to claims about Jesus’ identity or the nature of discipleship. For evaluation, weigh different interpretations: show why a miracle might be read as a sign of divine authority, as a story shaped for teaching, or as a challenge to social norms. Compare the emphases of Matthew and Mark and consider implications for Christians today, balancing textual evidence with reasoned judgement. In longer answers, structure your response into clear paragraphs that each make one main point, include textual evidence, and then explain its relevance. Conclude by summarising your argument and offering a judgment that answers the question directly. Remember the assessment objectives: AO1 rewards accurate knowledge and clear description; AO2 rewards analysis, comparison and evaluation. Use appropriate theological vocabulary (for example “Messiah,” “Kingdom of God,” “transfiguration,” “discipleship”) and ensure your writing is organised, concise and supported by evidence from the Gospels.
