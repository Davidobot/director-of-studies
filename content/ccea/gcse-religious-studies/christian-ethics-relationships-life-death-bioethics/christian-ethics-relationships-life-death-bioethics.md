# Christian ethics: relationships, life and death, bioethics (GCSE Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## What is Christian ethics and why it matters
Christian ethics is the study of how Christians decide what is right and wrong in everyday life. It draws on the Bible, the teachings of Jesus, church tradition and reason to guide actions about relationships, the beginning and end of life, medical advances and social responsibility. Key ideas that often appear in answers include the sanctity of life (the belief that life is sacred because it is given by God), agape or self-giving love (the example of Jesus’ love for others), and the importance of conscience. Different Christian traditions—Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Baptist and others—may apply these ideas in different ways, so you must be ready to explain and compare different viewpoints rather than present a single “Christian” answer.

## Sources of Christian moral teaching
Christian moral thinking uses several sources. The Bible supplies stories, commands and teachings that shape attitudes: commandments about human life and sexual conduct, Jesus’ teachings about love, forgiveness and the value of the poor, and early Christian letters about marriage and community responsibilities. Church teaching—official statements, tradition and the practice of worship—also shapes decisions. For example, the Roman Catholic Church has a clear sacramental view of marriage and strong teachings about the sanctity of life, while many Protestant churches emphasise the authority of scripture and the role of the local congregation. Reason and experience are also important: Christians think about consequences, intentions and the needs of real people when deciding what to do. When you explain moral issues in an exam, show how these sources lead to different conclusions in practice.

## Relationships, sex and the family
Christian teaching about relationships highlights the importance of commitment, responsibility and love. Marriage has traditionally been seen as the proper context for sexual activity and for raising children, and passages such as Genesis 2:24 and teachings of Jesus about marriage are often used to support this view. Christians also discuss the purposes of sex—procreation, the expression of love and the strengthening of the marital bond—and reflect on the role of celibacy for priests and religious people.

Diversity of view is important. Some churches accept civil partnerships or cohabiting couples, while others regard marriage as a lifelong sacrament. Views on divorce vary too: many churches recognise that there are situations where divorce may be unavoidable, while still encouraging reconciliation. Same-sex relationships are another area of disagreement. Some denominations now fully accept same-sex marriage and clergy, arguing for equality and an understanding of love and fidelity, while other churches maintain that sexual relationships belong within a male–female marriage. When studying these topics, it helps to give both the traditional and more liberal Christian positions and to explain the biblical or theological reasons behind them.

## Matters of life and death: abortion, euthanasia and punishment
Questions about the beginning and end of life bring deep moral and emotional disagreements. On abortion, Christians divide into pro-life and pro-choice positions. Those who are pro-life appeal to the sanctity of life and scriptural principles that value human life from conception, arguing that deliberate termination is morally wrong except in rare circumstances. Other Christians support a pro-choice approach that gives significant moral weight to the mother’s life, health and circumstances and argue that early embryos do not have the same moral status as a born person. Church bodies and Christian thinkers present sophisticated arguments on both sides, and exam answers should describe these arguments and assess their strengths.

Euthanasia and assisted dying raise similar issues. Many Christians oppose active euthanasia because it involves deliberately ending a life, which conflicts with the sanctity of life and the belief that suffering can have meaning. Some accept withholding or withdrawing burdensome treatment (passive euthanasia) when it only prolongs dying without benefit. Others argue for the relief of suffering and for personal autonomy in end-of-life choices. The Hospice movement is a Christian-inspired example of how believers respond to suffering by providing care and dignity without actively ending life.

Debates about capital punishment and the aims of punishment (protection, deterrence, retribution, reformation, vindication) show how Christian ethics must balance justice and mercy. Many Christians today oppose the death penalty and prefer restorative justice because of Jesus’ emphasis on forgiveness and the possibility of repentance, but others have argued that capital punishment can be justified in limited circumstances to protect the innocent.

## Developments in bioethics: fertility, embryos and surrogacy
Modern reproductive technologies raise complex moral questions that Christian ethics must address. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) has enabled many infertile couples to have children, which many Christians see as a positive use of medical skill and a way to support family life. However, IVF also raises questions about the moral status of embryos, the ethical issues around unused embryos being destroyed or used in research, and the implications of selecting embryos. For many Roman Catholics the destruction of embryos is unacceptable because of the belief that human life begins at conception, while other Christians may accept embryo research under strict conditions if it can lead to medical benefits.

Surrogacy and donor conception challenge traditional ideas about parenthood. Christians ask whether surrogacy treats women or children as means rather than persons, but some also recognise altruistic surrogacy where a woman helps a couple to have a child. National regulatory bodies, such as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in the United Kingdom, exist to provide legal and ethical frameworks for these technologies. When answering exam questions, explain the technology, present the differing Christian responses and evaluate how factors such as intention, consequences and the dignity of persons influence ethical judgements.

## Christianity, social justice and warfare
Christian ethics reaches beyond individuals to social problems. Teachings such as “love your neighbour” and the parable of the Good Samaritan inform Christian responses to poverty, discrimination and injustice. Churches and Christian organisations play a major role in relief work, campaigning for fair trade and helping refugees, and their priorities often include care for the vulnerable and advocacy for structural change.

On the morality of war, Christians have developed the Just War tradition, which sets criteria for when war might be morally permissible (just cause, last resort, proportionality, proper authority) and how it should be conducted. Others, following Jesus’ teaching to love enemies and peacemaking, adopt pacifism and refuse to support violence. Modern issues such as weapons of mass destruction and nuclear deterrence pose difficult questions: does deterrence prevent greater evil or does it rely on the threat of immoral acts? Good exam answers will outline both Just War reasoning and pacifist objections and show awareness of the human and economic cost of conflict, including the plight of refugees and child soldiers.

## How to approach ethical questions in Christianity
When thinking about Christian ethics, try to combine clear knowledge with careful evaluation. Describe the religious beliefs and practices that are relevant, explain how they lead to particular ethical positions, and show how different Christian traditions interpret the same sources differently. Use biblical references and examples of church teaching where appropriate, and bring in real-world examples—such as hospice care, IVF clinics, a charity like Christian Aid, or public debates about assisted dying—to demonstrate understanding. Always consider strengths and weaknesses: for example, the sanctity of life argument gives clear protection to the vulnerable but can be challenged when competing rights are at stake. Use ethical vocabulary—sanctity of life, stewardship, conscience, authority, intention, consequences—to make your explanations precise.

## Exam technique
In exams, remember the two assessment objectives: AO1 asks you to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of religion, so start your answers with clear definitions and accurate descriptions of beliefs, scripture and church positions. AO2 asks you to analyse and evaluate, so follow description with balanced reasoning, evidence and a conclusion. Structure longer answers with an introduction that defines key terms, a main body that explains different viewpoints and the reasons for them, and a short conclusion that reaches an informed judgement. Use specific examples and quotations where they help, but always explain their relevance. For extended writing questions, write clearly and check spelling, grammar and punctuation; organise paragraphs so each one develops a single idea; and use specialist vocabulary correctly. Time yourself in the exam so you can plan, write and review. Finally, show that you understand diversity within Christianity: naming both Catholic and Protestant positions, explaining why they differ and evaluating which arguments seem strongest will gain higher marks.
