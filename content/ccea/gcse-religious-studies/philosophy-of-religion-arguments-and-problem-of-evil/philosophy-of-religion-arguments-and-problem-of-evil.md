# Philosophy of religion: arguments for God and the problem of evil (GCSE Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview
Philosophy of religion asks big questions about whether God exists, what God might be like, and how belief or unbelief affects human life. At GCSE level you will meet classic arguments that have been used to support the existence of God and equally important challenges to belief, especially the problem of evil. Learning these ideas involves knowing key terms and thinkers, understanding the structure of arguments, and being able to evaluate strengths and weaknesses. This guide explains the main arguments for God, the nature of the problem of evil, religious responses and secular challenges, and it offers practical ways to show knowledge and evaluation in exam answers.

## Key terms and the nature of God
Before examining arguments, it helps to be clear about basic vocabulary. A theist believes in a personal God who is involved with the world. An atheist denies the existence of such a God. An agnostic says the existence of God is unknown or unknowable. Religious philosophers often describe God with attributes such as omnipotence (all-powerful), omniscience (all-knowing), omnibenevolence (all-good), immanence (present within creation) and transcendence (beyond creation). Different traditions and thinkers emphasise different combinations of these attributes, and some responses to the problem of evil involve questioning exactly what these attributes mean in practice.

## Classical arguments for the existence of God
Several traditional arguments aim to show that belief in God is rational. The cosmological argument asks why anything exists at all. Thomas Aquinas offered a version that points from motion, cause, contingency and order to the need for a first cause or necessary being — an uncaused cause that explains why there is something rather than nothing. A related form, the Kalam cosmological argument, developed in medieval Islamic thought and restated in modern philosophy, concentrates on the beginning of the universe: everything that begins to exist has a cause, the universe began to exist, therefore the universe has a cause.

The teleological or design argument finds evidence of order and purpose in nature and infers a designer. William Paley’s famous watchmaker analogy compared the complex purposive features of living things to a watch, arguing that both require an intelligent maker. Critics point to David Hume’s earlier sceptical observations and to scientific explanations such as natural selection, which can account for complexity without invoking a designer.

The moral argument suggests that objective moral values or duties exist and that God provides the best foundation for them. Thinkers like Immanuel Kant argued that moral law implies a moral author or a framework in which justice can ultimately be achieved. Contemporary defenders, including C. S. Lewis in popular form, claim that without God objective goodness loses its grounding; critics reply that moral behaviour can be explained by evolutionary biology, social contract, human reason or secular ethical theories.

The argument from religious experience takes testimonies of encounters with the divine—visions, answered prayer, mystical experiences—and treats them as evidence that God exists. William James wrote about the variety and transformative power of such experiences and argued they can be rational grounds for belief. Skeptics respond that experiences may have psychological, neurological or social explanations, and they question the reliability of subjective reports.

Each argument has internal variations and a history of support and criticism. Effective answers show the argument’s structure, name representative thinkers, and set out clear reasons in favour and against.

## Creation, science and conflicting explanations
Arguments for God often interact with scientific accounts of origins. Creation stories in different religions offer meaningful accounts of human place in the universe. Scientific theories such as the Big Bang and evolution provide naturalistic explanations for cosmic and biological origins. These explanations need not always be in direct conflict. Some believers accept the Big Bang and evolution and read creation stories in non-literal ways, while others defend creationism or intelligent design as alternative accounts. In exam answers it is useful to explain the difference between methodological naturalism (science seeks natural explanations) and metaphysical claims about meaning and purpose, making clear where philosophical or theological arguments address questions that science does not directly settle.

## The problem of evil: what it is and why it matters
The problem of evil challenges belief in an all-powerful, all-knowing and all-good God. It is often presented in two forms. The logical problem of evil argues that the existence of gratuitous or apparently pointless suffering is logically incompatible with the traditional attributes of God. The evidential problem of evil says that the amount and kinds of suffering we see make the existence of such a God unlikely. Philosophers like J. L. Mackie formulated this as an inconsistent triad: God is omnipotent, God is omnibenevolent, and evil exists; at least one of these must be false or reinterpreted.

It is important to distinguish moral evil—suffering caused by free agents, such as murder or abuse—from natural evil—suffering caused by natural processes, such as earthquakes, disease or tsunamis. The issue of innocent suffering, such as the suffering of children, presents a particularly sharp challenge because it seems difficult to explain why a benevolent deity would permit such suffering.

## Theodicies and philosophical responses
Religious thinkers have developed a range of theodicies, or explanations intended to reconcile God with evil. Augustine argued that evil is not a substance but a privation of good; human free will explains moral evil because genuine freedom makes moral responsibility possible. The free will defence, refined by philosophers such as Alvin Plantinga, contends that God could have morally sufficient reasons to permit evil if it arises from free choices that make love and moral growth possible. Plantinga’s work shows how free will can defend the logical compatibility of God and evil, though it does not necessarily answer the evidential problem.

Irenaeus, an early Christian thinker, proposed a soul-making theodicy: suffering and moral challenge are necessary for spiritual growth and the development of virtues such as compassion and courage. John Hick later expanded this into a more systematic account, suggesting that the world is a “vale of soul-making” in which challenges have a purpose for moral and spiritual development.

Other responses modify divine attributes. Process theology, for example, suggests God’s power is persuasive rather than coercive, so God cannot unilaterally prevent all suffering. Skeptical theism argues that human beings have limited epistemic access to God’s reasons; what seems gratuitous to us may have reasons beyond our understanding. Some philosophers and theologians accept limits to omnipotence or omniscience as a way to reconcile the facts of suffering with belief.

Opposing responses include atheistic or secular explanations: suffering is a feature of a natural world governed by impersonal laws; moral evil is explained by psychology and social causation; appeals to divine purposes are seen as unsatisfactory when human pain is intense and prolonged.

## Comparative and religiously distinct approaches to suffering
Different world religions offer distinct resources for responding to suffering. In Hindu and Buddhist frameworks, the idea of karma links present suffering to moral consequences of past actions, often across lifetimes, and provides a moral explanation for why suffering occurs. Buddhism focuses on suffering as a central human problem and offers a practical path to its cessation through ethical living, meditation and wisdom, rather than centring a creator God as the solver of the problem. Islamic and Jewish traditions include rich theological responses that emphasise trust in God, communal responsibility, and divine justice in ways that speak to their own scriptures and practices. When writing about theodicy in exam answers, it is helpful to show awareness that not all traditions frame the problem in the same way as classical Christian philosophy.

## Evaluating the arguments: strengths and weaknesses
When assessing arguments for God and responses to evil, balance is essential. The cosmological argument appeals to intuition about causation and the need for an ultimate explanation, but critics ask whether the chain must terminate in a personal God rather than a brute fact or necessary physical law. The design argument can be persuasive because of the appearance of order, yet scientific explanations such as evolution challenge its central inference and show how complexity can arise without intentional design. The moral argument raises deep questions about the grounding of objective values, but evolutionary and secular ethical accounts offer alternative explanations for moral behaviour.

On the problem of evil, free will defence has force in explaining moral evil, yet it struggles with natural evil and gratuitous suffering. Soul-making theodicies give meaning to suffering for character development, but they can sound unsatisfying when applied to extreme suffering. Skeptical theism protects theism from easy refutation but risks making God’s reasons unintelligible and religious belief less meaningful. A strong essay will identify specific examples, show awareness of counter-arguments, and reach a considered conclusion rather than simply listing points.

## Exam technique
In exams you will be assessed on two main skills: demonstrating accurate knowledge (AO1) and analysing or evaluating ideas (AO2). Begin answers by defining key terms and naming the argument or issue you will discuss. For AO1, describe the structure of arguments clearly: for example, state the premises and conclusion of the cosmological or design argument and name a major supporter and critic. Use examples and short quotations where helpful. For AO2, evaluate by explaining strengths and weaknesses, considering counter-arguments, and weighing evidence. When discussing the problem of evil, make sure to distinguish moral from natural evil and to explain specific theodicies such as the free will defence and soul-making.

Structure longer answers with an introduction that sets out the issue, a middle that alternates description and evaluation, and a brief conclusion that reaches a balanced judgement. Try to use specialist vocabulary accurately, but keep sentences clear and focused. Plan your time so you can include at least one paragraph evaluating each major point you describe, and aim to show awareness of more than one religious or non-religious perspective where relevant. Finally, link your evaluation back to the question and make a clear final judgement that shows why you favour that conclusion.
