# Protestant churches: denominations, worship and ordinances (GCSE Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview and origins
Protestantism began in the 16th century as part of the Reformation, a movement that sought to reform what its leaders saw as problems in the medieval Western Church. Figures such as Martin Luther, John Calvin and others challenged teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church and emphasised direct access to Scripture, justification by faith, and the authority of the Bible. From these beginnings a wide variety of Protestant traditions developed. Although Protestants share certain key convictions—such as the centrality of Scripture and the importance of personal faith—they differ widely in organisation, worship style and theological emphasis. Understanding Protestant churches means recognising both this shared heritage and the diversity that has grown from different historical, cultural and theological contexts.

## Denominations and diversity
There is no single “Protestant Church”; instead there are many denominations. The Anglican tradition (for example the Church of England) keeps much of the liturgy, structure and festivals of historic Christianity while emphasising the Bible and liturgical worship. The Reformed family, including Presbyterian churches, places strong emphasis on preaching, covenant theology and a representative system of elders. Methodism, founded by John Wesley, stresses personal holiness, social action and passionate hymn-singing. Baptists insist on believer’s baptism and congregational authority, practicing baptism by full immersion. Pentecostal and charismatic churches prioritise experiences of the Holy Spirit, expressive forms of worship and spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues. Some groups, for instance the Salvation Army and Quakers, reject formal sacraments or liturgy altogether and focus instead on practical Christian living and social service. These differences reflect distinct theological answers to questions such as how people are saved, how the church should be governed, what worship should look like and how Scripture is interpreted.

## Structure and leadership
Protestant church governance varies from hierarchical to highly local. Anglican churches retain an episcopal structure with bishops and priests; the bishop has oversight of a diocese and ordains clergy. Presbyterian churches operate through elected elders and assemblies, reflecting the belief in shared leadership. Baptist and many evangelical churches are congregational: the local congregation governs itself and calls its own ministers. The role of ordination also differs in meaning and practice. In some denominations ordination marks a distinct clerical office; in others it recognises a calling to ministry while emphasising the “priesthood of all believers”—the idea, rooted in Reformation teaching, that all Christians share in God’s service. Titles and roles therefore change across traditions: “priest” is common in Anglican contexts, “minister” or “pastor” in many Protestant churches, and leadership may also include deacons, elders, worship leaders and lay pastors.

## Worship styles, music and church architecture
Worship in Protestant churches ranges from formal liturgy to spontaneous charismatic gatherings. Liturgical churches like Anglican and Methodist congregations will follow an order of service that includes readings from Scripture, prayers, set responses, hymns and often a structured celebration of Communion. Non-liturgical churches, common among many evangelical, Baptist and Pentecostal communities, place greater emphasis on expository preaching, contemporary worship music and open prayers. Music has been a key element in Protestant identity: the hymns of Charles Wesley shaped Methodist worship, while modern worship bands have become central to many evangelical services.

Architecture and furnishing also reflect different priorities. In many Protestant churches the pulpit is visually prominent, underlining the importance of preaching and the sermon. Where Communion is central, a communion table or altar will be placed at the front; Anglican churches may also have a chancel and an altar with a reserved sacrament. Baptismal fonts remain in churches that practice infant baptism; where believer’s baptism is practiced, a baptismal pool may be used for full immersion. Protestant buildings generally avoid the use of icons and statues so common in Catholic worship, although stained glass, crosses and other symbolic art remain widespread. The lectern, pulpit, font and communion table are the primary furniture items whose symbolism students should understand.

## Baptism and Communion: ordinances and sacramental beliefs
Protestant churches speak of baptism and Communion in different ways and attach different meanings to them. Many Protestant groups prefer the term “ordinances” to “sacraments,” emphasising that these practices were commanded by Christ and are acts of obedience and public witness. Baptism practices illustrate clear diversity. Denominations that retain infant baptism, such as Anglican and Methodist churches, view baptism as initiation into the covenant community and often as a sign of God’s prevenient grace. Churches that insist on believer’s baptism, such as Baptists and many evangelical congregations, argue that baptism should follow a personal confession of faith and so practise baptism by full immersion as a public testimony of conversion.

Communion (also called the Eucharist, the Lord’s Supper or Holy Communion) is another area of varied belief. Some Protestant traditions, such as many Anglicans and Lutherans, speak of a real presence of Christ in the elements in ways that preserve a sacramental understanding, even if they reject the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. Reformed churches tend to emphasise a spiritual presence or a means of grace by which believers are spiritually nourished. Other groups, notably memorialist Baptists and some evangelical churches, view Communion primarily as a symbolic remembrance of Jesus’ death, a practice commanded by Christ to be observed regularly as a sign of unity and obedience. Practical differences include whether Communion is open (all baptized Christians may attend), closed (only members of that denomination may receive), frequent or occasional; whether the bread is unleavened or leavened; and whether wine or grape juice is used.

## Festivals, prayer and special practices
Protestant churches observe the major Christian festivals—Advent, Christmas, Lent, Holy Week, Easter and Pentecost—though the emphasis and liturgical richness vary. Anglicans and many mainline Protestants retain seasonal services and traditions that mark the Christian year. Evangelical and Pentecostal churches may focus more on events such as Easter and Pentecost for evangelistic outreach and renewal. Types of prayer and personal devotion show wide variety: structured prayers and the Lord’s Prayer are central in liturgical settings, while informal, spontaneous prayer and testimony are important in charismatic congregations. Some Protestant groups maintain particular devotional practices such as the use of creeds (for example the Apostles’ Creed) or set Bible readings, while others prioritise small groups, Bible study, fellowship meetings and deliberate evangelistic activity.

## The role of Protestant churches in contemporary society
Protestant churches play multiple roles in modern communities. They provide worship and pastoral care, run schools, hospitals and charities, and engage in campaigns for justice and relief. Historically, Protestant movements have been associated with social reform—such as abolition, education and relief work—and many denominations continue that emphasis through local outreach and international aid. Protestant responses to contemporary ethical issues vary: denominations will take different positions on matters such as same-sex relationships, divorce and remarriage, bioethical questions and the role of women in ministry. Ecumenical activity—cooperation between different Christian traditions—has grown since the 20th century, producing joint services, social action partnerships and shared ministries. At the same time, Protestantism’s internal diversity means it often represents a wide range of public voices on moral and political questions.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Protestant churches, aim to balance clear factual knowledge with evaluation. For AO1 responses, describe accurately: explain what a denomination believes or does, name examples (for instance, contrast Anglican liturgy with Baptist believer’s baptism), and use correct terms such as “ordination,” “priesthood of all believers,” “liturgical,” “non-liturgical,” “Eucharist” and “ordinance.” For AO2 responses, analyse and evaluate: explain why differences exist (historical Reformation roots, theology of Scripture, views of sacraments), assess the significance of practices for believers’ identity and community life, and present reasoned judgements. In longer answers, structure your response with a brief introduction, clear paragraphs each addressing a single point, and a concise conclusion that answers the question directly.

Use examples and evidence to support points: refer to specific denominations and typical practices, and where useful mention key biblical passages or historical events (for example Pentecost, the Reformation) to show understanding. Compare and contrast viewpoints when asked to evaluate—explain strengths and weaknesses of each position and consider the impact on worship, church life and wider society. Time management is essential: spend the first few minutes planning, allocate more time to higher-mark questions, and leave a couple of minutes to proofread for clarity, spelling and specialist vocabulary. Always aim to show both knowledge and evaluation to meet the assessment objectives and to demonstrate quality of written communication.
