# Revelation and religious experience (scripture, prayer, miracles) (GCSE Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview
Revelation and religious experience are central to how many people understand God and the meaning of life. In the Christian tradition, revelation is how God makes knowledge of himself available to human beings. Religious experience is the personal or communal encounter with what believers take to be the divine. For GCSE work this topic asks you to study where Christians believe God is revealed (for example through scripture, prayer and miracles), to know key biblical examples and teachings, and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of claims about divine communication. Understanding the difference between being able to describe beliefs (AO1) and being able to analyse and evaluate them (AO2) is vital for good exam answers.

## Scripture as revelation
Scripture occupies a primary place in Christian claims about revelation. Christians believe the Bible contains God’s self‑communication in history, especially in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. The New Testament grew out of early Christian worship and teaching: letters, Gospel accounts and early creeds were written, shared and finally recognised as authoritative by the Church. Different Christian traditions explain the Bible’s authority in different ways. The Catholic Church speaks of the Bible together with Tradition and the Church’s teaching authority; many Protestant denominations emphasise sola scriptura, the idea that scripture alone is the final authority in matters of faith and practice. Students should be able to explain what is meant by inspiration — for example, that God inspired human authors so their writings are trustworthy — and to show how Christians use scripture in worship, moral teaching and personal devotion. Useful scripture references for this unit include the events of Pentecost (Acts 2) as the birth of the Church, and Paul’s teaching about the church and spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 12, which show how scripture and experience were linked in the earliest communities.

Scripture is not self‑interpreting. Historical context, literary genre (poetry, narrative, letter, parable) and translation affect understanding. Teaching that helps students should include short exercises in comparing literal and metaphorical readings of passages, and consideration of how different communities have read texts across time. Recognising the role of scripture in forming creeds such as the Apostles’ Creed helps explain how revelation was summarised and taught.

## Types of revelation and religious experience
Revelation is often divided into general and special forms. General revelation refers to what can be known about God through nature, conscience and reason: the beauty of creation, the moral sense, and order in the universe. Special revelation refers to particular acts in history or events through which God communicates directly: Jesus himself, the events recounted in scripture, prophetic messages, visions and miracles.

Religious experience can be private or corporate. Private experiences include conversion experiences (such as Saul’s/Paul’s vision on the road to Damascus), mystical experiences and answered prayer. Corporate experiences include Pentecost, where the early Christian community experienced the coming of the Holy Spirit together, and communal healings or revival meetings. When teaching, use clear examples: Paul’s conversion as a well‑known instance of a life‑changing vision; the Transfiguration and the Resurrection as events Christians interpret as extraordinary revelations of Jesus’ identity; and modern reported experiences such as apparitions or charismatic gifts to illustrate continuity and difference with biblical examples.

It is helpful to ask students to reflect on criteria used to judge experiences: transformation of life, consistency with established teaching, communal confirmation, and the “fruits” of the experience such as increased love or moral change.

## Prayer and encountering God
Prayer is the human practice most often associated with seeking and receiving revelation. Prayer takes many forms: adoration, confession, thanksgiving and supplication. Some Christians use the ACTS pattern (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Supplication) to structure private prayer, while liturgical traditions integrate prayer with scripture and sacraments in public worship. Prayer can be quiet and contemplative, formal and liturgical, or spontaneous and charismatic. In some traditions, the Eucharist or Mass is the central point of encounter with God, where scripture is proclaimed and Christians receive the sacrament in which they experience Christ’s presence.

Answered prayer is often advanced as evidence of God’s active presence. Teachers should guide students to give examples of prayers that appear to be answered, and also to consider unanswered prayer and how believers respond: some argue that unanswered prayer tests faith or invites deeper reflection on God’s will; others suggest it raises questions about God’s benevolence or power. Speaking in tongues, prophecy and healing are also associated with prayerful experience in some churches; these show how experience and belief interact, because claims are interpreted in light of scripture and community norms (for example Paul’s guidance on gifts in 1 Corinthians).

## Miracles: meaning, examples and importance
Miracles are events that many believers regard as signs of God’s intervention in the natural order. In the Gospels, Jesus’ miracles serve to reveal his identity as Son of God and to demonstrate the inbreaking of God’s kingdom. Healing miracles, exorcisms, control over nature, feeding the multitudes and, above all, the resurrection, are central to Christian claims about Jesus. Students should be able to recount specific miracle stories from Matthew and Mark (for example healing a paralysed man and calming the storm) and explain how these stories impact Christian belief about Jesus and salvation.

In contemporary contexts, miracle claims continue: reports of healings, Lourdes or other pilgrimage miracles, and dramatic conversions are still offered as evidence of God’s action. It is important to distinguish between describing miracle claims and evaluating them. Philosophical and scientific challenges include questions about natural explanations, the reliability of testimony, and the problem of inconsistent miracles across religions. Historically minded students should be aware of thinkers who challenge miracles, such as David Hume’s argument that natural laws are established by uniform experience and that miracle claims require extraordinary evidence. Believers respond in various ways: some accept miracles as violations of natural laws, others view them as rare acts that point beyond themselves to God’s purposes, and some reframe miracles as events that carry meaning without necessarily breaking physical laws.

## Challenges, verification and interpretation
A central part of GCSE evaluation is assessing the strengths and weaknesses of religious claims. Religious experiences and revelations raise philosophical and psychological questions. Critics suggest that visions and voices may be hallucinations or wish‑fulfilment, that cultural background shapes interpretation, and that confirmation bias or emotional states can lead people to misidentify events. Philosophical problems such as the problem of evil challenge the coherence of an all‑powerful, all‑good God who reveals himself but does not prevent suffering.

Defences include pointing to the transformative effect of genuine experiences, the communal testing of claims in religious traditions, and the consistency of some experiences with longstanding scripture and practice. Methods of verification used by communities include corroborating testimony, long‑term moral change in the person, alignment with doctrinal truth, and ecclesial or scholarly scrutiny. For example, the Catholic Church has historically investigated claimed apparitions through a formal process that looks at evidence, theological coherence and pastoral fruits. Comparing different religious responses is also helpful: many world religions accept revelation, though they differ on its form and authority, and some non‑religious positions treat experiences as psychologically explainable but still socially important.

Encourage students to apply critical thinking: recognise possible natural explanations, examine the quality of evidence, and test how an experience fits within broader spiritual and ethical patterns. Balanced evaluation gains credit: it is not enough to dismiss or accept without argument; good answers weigh evidence and show awareness of different perspectives.

## Exam technique
Always start answers by making clear what the question asks and defining key terms such as revelation, prophecy, inspiration or miracle. For AO1 material, present factual knowledge clearly: give named examples (for instance Acts 2 for Pentecost, 1 Corinthians 12 on spiritual gifts, and specific Gospel miracle stories), explain teachings (general versus special revelation, sola scriptura versus scripture plus tradition), and describe practices (types of prayer, liturgical and non‑liturgical worship). For AO2 material, balance strengths and weaknesses: use philosophical objections (for example Hume on miracles, psychological explanations for visions) and religious responses (transformative effect, communal validation, theological explanations). Use short quotations or precise scripture references where relevant, but do not over‑quote.

Structure extended answers with a clear introduction that defines terms, a middle section that develops points with evidence and analysis, and a conclusion that reaches a reasoned judgement. In evaluative questions, give at least two reasons for and two reasons against, and then decide which side you find more persuasive and why. Make sure you answer the question set — if asked about miracles, focus on miracles rather than drifting into unrelated material. Quality of written communication is assessed: write legibly, use correct spelling and grammar, and include specialist vocabulary such as “inspiration,” “Pentecost,” “transubstantiation” or “sacrament” where appropriate and accurately.

Manage time in the exam so that you allocate more time to questions carrying greater marks, and practice writing concise paragraphs that make one clear point each. Plan answers briefly before writing to ensure logical flow. Finally, revise model answers and examiners’ reports to see what level of detail and balance gains the higher grades, and practise applying the same evidence in different question styles so you can adapt knowledge to description, explanation and evaluation tasks.
