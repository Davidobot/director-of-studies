# Islam: beliefs, practices, festivals and contemporary issues (GCSE Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Introduction and overview
When studying Islam at GCSE you are learning about one of the world’s major living religions: its origins, its sacred texts, its core beliefs and the ways those beliefs are practised by Muslims today. Islam is diverse: there are different traditions and schools of thought, most notably Sunni, Shi’a and Sufi, and there is a wide variety of practice and interpretation in different countries and communities. To understand Islam as a living faith you will need to combine knowledge of its formative history with an awareness of how scripture, religious law and local custom shape beliefs, worship and ethical choices. This section summarises the key areas you should be confident with for the exam: the life of the Prophet and the early community, the Qur’an and Hadith, the central beliefs such as the unity of God, the Five Pillars, festival observance and contemporary questions such as the role of women and practicing Islam in a non‑Muslim society.

## The formative history of Islam
Islam began in the 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula with the life and mission of Muhammad. Muslims regard him as the final prophet who received revelation from God over a period of about twenty-three years. The early Muslim community was formed in Mecca and later Medina, where the Prophet acted as a spiritual leader and statesman. After Muhammad’s death, leadership passed to the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs—Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali—whose rule saw the consolidation of the community and rapid expansion beyond Arabia. One crucial historical development was the compilation of the Qur’an into a single text under the third caliph, a process that provided the foundation for Muslim worship and law. The early period also laid the roots of divisions: differing views about legitimate leadership after the Prophet contributed to the development of Sunni and Shi’a identities, while mystical currents developed into Sufi orders that emphasise personal spiritual experience.

## Sacred writings, the Sunnah and Sharia
The Qur’an is central to Islam as the revealed word of God. Muslims understand the Qur’an as guidance for life, covering doctrine, worship and ethical conduct. The revelations received by Muhammad were memorised and written down by his companions; the text was later standardized so that Muslims today read the same Qur’an in Arabic, although many rely on translations to understand its meaning. Complementing the Qur’an are the Sunnah and the Hadith: collections of the Prophet’s sayings, actions and approvals that provide practical examples of how the Qur’an’s teachings were implemented. Together the Qur’an and Sunnah form the basis for Sharia, a system of religious law and moral guidance. Sharia covers ritual duties such as prayer and fasting, as well as family law, commercial dealings and moral obligations. In practice, Sharia is interpreted and applied differently across communities and legal schools, so students should be aware of both the ideals of religious law and the range of contemporary applications.

## Core beliefs: God, prophets, afterlife and diversity of traditions
Central to Islam is the belief in the absolute unity and uniqueness of God, expressed by the term tawhid. God is transcendent and sovereign, the creator and sustainer of the universe, and Muslims emphasise both God’s closeness to creation and His otherness. Prophethood is fundamental: prophets are messengers chosen by God to call people to the right way of living, and Muhammad is regarded as the final prophet. Beliefs about life after death, resurrection, judgement and reward or punishment are important motivators for Muslim ethics and worship. Within Islam there is significant diversity. Sunni Muslims look to the consensus of the community and the early caliphs for guidance, while Shi’a Muslims place special authority in the line of Imams descended from Ali and his family, and commemorate events such as Ashura that mark the suffering of Hussein. Sufi Muslims emphasise inner spirituality, seeking a direct experiential relationship with God through prayer, remembrance (dhikr) and disciplines passed down in spiritual orders. Being able to explain these core beliefs and to show how different traditions interpret them is essential for exam answers.

## Worship and the Five Pillars
The practical life of Islam is shaped by the Five Pillars, a framework of duties that structures the worship and social life of many Muslims. The Shahada is the testimony of faith, a concise declaration that there is no god but God and Muhammad is His messenger; it expresses the centrality of monotheism. Salah is the ritual prayer offered five times a day facing the Kaʿba in Mecca; it involves cleansing (wudu), specific postures and recitation, and it can be performed communally in a mosque or individually. Sawm is fasting during the month of Ramadan, a period of daytime abstention from food, drink and other things that heightens spiritual awareness; the fast is broken each evening with a meal and the month includes special night prayers called tarawih. Zakat is an obligatory alms payment designed to redistribute wealth and assist the needy; it reflects social responsibility and the care of the community, while Sadaqah refers to voluntary charity. Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca required of those who are able, involves rituals such as the tawaf (circumambulation of the Kaʿba), the sa’i (walking between Safa and Marwa), standing at Arafat and symbolic stoning of the pillars at Mina; it culminates in the festival of Eid‑ul‑Adha and reinforces the unity of the global Muslim community. Although these pillars are commonly taught as a clear set, you should be ready to explain variations in practice and emphasis across Sunni, Shi’a and Sufi communities.

## Mosques, festivals and rites of passage
Mosques are the focal point of public worship and community life. Architecturally they typically include a prayer hall oriented towards Mecca, a mihrab indicating the direction of prayer, a minbar for sermons, and often a minaret from which the call to prayer (adhan) is sounded. Festivals provide communal rhythms to the year. Ramadan ends with Eid‑ul‑Fitr, a joyful festival of breaking the fast, communal prayers and charitable giving. Eid‑ul‑Adha follows the Hajj and recalls Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice; it is marked by communal prayer and the ritual slaughter of an animal, with meat shared among family, friends and the poor. Rites of passage include birth ceremonies such as naming and sometimes a small ritual sacrifice, marriage ceremonies that combine legal contract and public celebration, and funeral rites that emphasise prompt burial and remembrance of the deceased. Students should be able to explain the religious meaning behind these ceremonies and how they shape identity and community belonging.

## Contemporary issues: ethics, identity and life in non‑Muslim societies
Contemporary questions invite you to apply Islamic teachings to modern ethical, social and political issues. The role and status of women is often discussed, and it is important to recognise the range of views within Islam. While some emphasise equality of spiritual worth and the educational and social rights given to women, others focus on distinct gender roles and specific practices such as veiling. Dress for modesty is interpreted in different ways: the hijab covers the hair and neck, the niqab covers the face except for the eyes, and the burqa covers the whole body including the eyes with a grille; attitudes to these vary across cultures and legal systems. Dietary rules such as halal and haram govern permissible food and methods of slaughter; prohibition of pork and alcohol is widely observed, but there are debates about modern food production and animal welfare. Financial ethics, including the prohibition of riba (interest), have led to the development of Islamic banking and financial products designed to avoid usury. Living as a Muslim in a non‑Muslim society raises practical questions about accommodation and identity: availability of halal food, access to mosques, recognition of religious festivals in schools and workplaces, and how Muslims negotiate pluralism and integration. You should be prepared to explain both how Islamic teachings inform positions on these issues and how Muslims in different contexts respond in varied ways, using contemporary examples to show range and nuance.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions remember there are two key assessment objectives: AO1, which tests knowledge and understanding, and AO2, which tests analysis and evaluation. For AO1 aim to define terms clearly, describe beliefs, practices and sources of authority, and include specific examples such as the names of the Rightly‑Guided Caliphs, the Five Pillars, or the rituals of Hajj. For AO2 move beyond description: explain why beliefs or practices matter, compare different viewpoints within Islam, consider strengths and weaknesses of particular positions and reach a balanced conclusion. Structure your answers so that each paragraph has a clear point, supporting evidence and a brief explanation of significance. In longer questions begin with a short introduction that outlines how you will answer, then develop two or three well‑focused paragraphs and finish with a concise conclusion that answers the question. For the extended writing question worth more marks manage your time so you can plan for five to ten minutes, write your answer clearly using religious vocabulary (for example tawhid, shahada, salah, zakat, hadith, sharia), and spend a final five minutes checking spelling, punctuation and presentation. Use examples to demonstrate knowledge of diversity: explain how Sunni, Shi’a and Sufi perspectives might differ on a point, and where appropriate show how modern contexts influence practice. When asked to ‘evaluate’ or ‘assess’, weigh arguments and show why one line of reasoning might be stronger or more convincing for particular groups. Finally, ensure your handwriting is legible and your sentences are clear so that the examiner can reward both the content and the quality of written communication.
