# Judaism: beliefs, practices, festivals and contemporary issues (GCSE Religious Studies Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## The formative history and the idea of covenant
Judaism begins with a story of calling and promise. The narratives of Abraham and Moses are central: Abraham is presented as the first person called by God to enter into a unique relationship, and Moses is the leader through whom the Israelites are freed from slavery and given the Law. These stories are not simply ancient history for Jews; they provide the religious framework of covenant — a binding relationship between God and the Jewish people. Covenant means both privilege and responsibility: the people are chosen to live according to God’s commandments, and in return God promises protection, guidance and a special relationship with the land and with Jerusalem. Different Jewish traditions interpret these promises in varied ways. For some, the covenant includes a physical tie to the land of Israel and to Jerusalem as a focal point of religious life; for others the emphasis is more spiritual, focusing on ethical living and the study of Torah wherever Jews live. Understanding covenant helps explain why certain places, stories and laws have continuing significance across centuries of Jewish life.

## Sacred writings: Torah, Prophets, Writings, Mishnah and Talmud
The Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh, is organised into three parts: Torah (the Law or Pentateuch), Nevi’im (the Prophets) and Ketuvim (the Writings). The Torah — the five books of Moses — is the foundation of Jewish law, ethics and identity. The Prophets and Writings expand history, prophecy, poetry and wisdom, shaping Jewish reflection on justice, repentance and hope. Alongside the written scriptures, rabbinic literature developed to interpret and apply the Torah. The Mishnah is a collection of early oral traditions that codified Jewish legal teachings, and the Talmud — made up of the Mishnah and the Gemara (later rabbinic discussions) — became the central reference for how commandments are lived out. For many Jews, the Talmud demonstrates how law and life are constantly in conversation. While Orthodox Jews tend to view the Torah as divinely revealed and the rabbinic writings as authoritative interpretation, Reform and Liberal movements often regard these texts as essential sources that must be read and reinterpreted in light of modern knowledge and values. Study of these writings — whether as legal code, moral teaching or spiritual literature — remains a core religious activity.

## Core beliefs and the diversity of Jewish traditions
Belief in one God, a moral and singular creator, is the defining theological point of Judaism. Jewish teaching emphasises God’s unity, justice and compassion, and encourages ethical behaviour as an expression of faith. Mitzvot — the commandments — are practical expressions of the covenant relationship; they guide everything from prayer to social justice. However, Judaism is not monolithic. Orthodox Judaism tends to maintain traditional practices and halakhah (Jewish law) as binding, including ritual observance and gender roles; Reform and Liberal Judaism place greater emphasis on individual autonomy, ethical principles and adaptation of ritual to contemporary life. There are also other streams, including Conservative and Modern Orthodox variants, and movements such as Reconstructionism internationally. These differences affect how communities approach rituals, the role of women, interpretations of sacred texts and engagement with modern society. Teaching about Judaism therefore requires attention to both shared beliefs and the range of practice and interpretation within the religion.

## Worship, prayer and the role of the synagogue
Public and private worship are both important in Jewish life. The synagogue functions as a house of prayer, study and community gathering. Architecturally, the synagogue normally includes the Ark, which contains Torah scrolls and is the focal point of worship; the bimah or raised platform from which the Torah is read; and often features symbolic items such as a menorah. In Orthodox synagogues a separation between men and women (a mechitzah) is common, whereas Reform and Liberal synagogues are usually egalitarian. The Rabbi provides teaching and pastoral leadership, and the Chazan or cantor leads musical elements of prayer. Daily prayer can be structured around three services — morning, afternoon and evening — and involves set liturgy as well as personal prayer. The home is also a central place for religious observance: the weekly Shabbat meal, blessings over food and study of Torah all reinforce religious identity. Ritual items such as the tallit (prayer shawl), tefillin (phylacteries) in some communities, and the kippah (head covering) are visible signs of devotion and identity.

## Festivals, sacred days and life-cycle ceremonies
The Jewish year is marked by festivals that combine historical memory, ethical reflection and communal ritual. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, is a time of reflection and the sounding of the shofar, while Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, focuses on repentance, fasting and communal confession. Pesach (Passover) commemorates liberation from slavery in Egypt and is observed with a seder meal and the removal of leaven; Sukkot recalls the desert wanderings and involves dwelling in a temporary hut (sukkah). Each festival has layered meanings — historical, agricultural and spiritual — and their rituals teach and renew communal memory. Life-cycle ceremonies anchor individual lives within the community. The Brit Milah, a circumcision for baby boys performed on the eighth day, marks the covenantal entry of the child into the Jewish people; naming ceremonies for girls are also observed in various ways. Bar and Bat Mitzvah mark the point of religious responsibility (traditionally at age 13 for boys and 12 or 13 for girls), when young people lead services or read from the Torah. Marriage commonly takes place under a chuppah (wedding canopy), and Jewish funerary practices emphasise prompt burial, modest ceremony and a structured period of mourning (shiva). These rites reinforce communal continuity and the presence of tradition in ordinary life.

## Law, ethics and everyday practice: mitzvot, kosher and Shabbat
The mitzvot shape daily behaviour as expressions of holiness and obedience. Observance ranges from ritual commandments to ethical obligations toward others. Dietary laws (kashrut) define permitted foods, the separation of milk and meat, and rules about ritual slaughter. For observant Jews these rules create a rhythm to eating that fosters mindfulness and identity; in modern multicultural societies, keeping kosher can be a way of maintaining distinction and continuity. Shabbat, the weekly day of rest from Friday evening to Saturday night, is a central religious practice that structures time around rest, prayer, family and community. How strictly these laws are followed differs widely: Orthodox communities maintain comprehensive observance, Conservative communities may observe many practices while accommodating modern life, and Reform or Liberal Jews often focus on the spiritual meaning of commandments while adapting practice. Teaching should stress that law and ethics are intertwined in Judaism: ritual practice frequently carries ethical overtones, and moral obligations are seen as part of religious fidelity.

## Contemporary issues: women, identity, prejudice and the land of Israel
Contemporary Jewish life raises a number of important issues. The role and status of women is a prominent topic; while Orthodox Judaism generally maintains traditional gender roles in public worship and certain legal areas, Reform and Liberal movements have worked for full equality of women in leadership, ordination and ritual participation. Dress and observance also raise questions about identity in plural societies: items like the kippah, modest dress or distinctive Orthodox attire can be expressions of faith but may also expose individuals to misunderstanding or abuse. Prejudice and persecution, including the long Jewish experience of antisemitism, remain crucial to study; this history explains why security, remembrance and education about prejudice are often priorities for Jewish communities. The question of the land of Israel and Jerusalem is complex: for many Jews these places have profound religious significance rooted in covenant and scripture, while political realities mean that religious belief and national or political opinions can take different forms across Jewish communities. Contemporary teaching should present the religious significance respectfully while distinguishing it from political positions, encouraging students to understand the range of religious perspectives.

## Judaism’s contributions to wider society
Jews have made significant contributions to science, culture, law, medicine, literature and social activism throughout history and in contemporary times. This influence stems in part from the Jewish emphasis on education, textual study and ethical responsibility. Rabbis, philosophers and scholars such as medieval legal thinkers shaped intellectual life; in modern times Jewish individuals and organisations have led charitable work, promoted human rights, participated in interfaith dialogue and contributed to public life. The ways in which Jewish thinkers translate religious values into action — for example, through community charities, hospitals, legal reform or educational initiatives — provide concrete examples of faith influencing public life. When studying an influential Jew, focus on how their background, commitments and actions reflect Jewish values and how their work has helped shape contemporary society.

## Exam technique
To do well in examination questions on Judaism, show clear knowledge and then analyse its significance. Start factual answers by defining key terms such as covenant, mitzvot or Torah, and follow with succinct description of beliefs, practices or historical events. When a question asks for explanation, link facts to their religious meaning: for example, explain how Shabbat expresses covenantal rest and community identity. For evaluation questions, present a balanced argument by giving at least two perspectives before reaching a reasoned judgement; for instance, when considering the role of women, describe Orthodox, Reform and Liberal positions and then explain which arguments you find most persuasive and why. Use examples from rituals, festivals and texts to support points, and where possible show how beliefs affect everyday life. Manage your time so you leave space for a short conclusion that summarises your main points and clearly answers the question. Finally, write legibly, use correct religious vocabulary and check spelling and grammar; clear expression will improve the mark awarded for quality of written communication.
