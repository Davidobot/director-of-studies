# Urban change: land use, inner-city issues & regeneration (GCSE Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## What “urban change” means and why it matters
Urban change describes how towns and cities grow and evolve in function, form and population. It includes physical changes to land use, shifts in who lives where, changes to transport and services, and deliberate planning or market-driven redevelopment. Understanding urban change helps explain everyday issues such as housing shortages, traffic congestion and neighbourhood decline, and it shows the range of possible responses—from social housing and improved public transport to large-scale regeneration schemes. At GCSE level you will be expected to explain these processes, interpret maps and photographs, evaluate different strategies and use case studies to support your answers.

## Urban land use: zones and how to identify them
Most settlements can be thought of in terms of broad land use zones: the central business district (CBD), the inner city, suburbs and the rural–urban fringe. The CBD is where shops, offices and major services cluster; it often has high land values and large-scale commercial buildings. The inner city lies close to the CBD and frequently contains older, denser housing, former industry and mixed-use areas. Suburbs are primarily residential and tend to have lower densities, gardens and more local shops. The rural–urban fringe is a transitional zone where urban uses meet countryside and where you may find business parks, supermarkets and new housing on former farmland.

You will be asked to identify these zones from maps and aerial photos; look for clues such as the density and pattern of buildings, road hierarchies, green space, and land use labels on Ordnance Survey maps. Cross-sectional sketches and simplified land use maps help to explain changes in gradient, building height and function from the centre outwards. Remember that real cities rarely follow a perfect model, so your answers should recognise mixed and changing land uses, for example newer housing replacing old terraces or business developments appearing on brownfield sites.

## Problems faced by inner-city areas in MEDCs
Inner-city areas in more economically developed countries (MEDCs) often face a cluster of social, economic and environmental problems. Housing may be poor quality or derelict where older industrial jobs have disappeared, leaving unemployment and lower incomes. Traffic congestion creates delays and air pollution, and problems with public transport may limit people’s access to jobs and services. Parking shortages in dense areas add pressure on streets and can increase conflict between residents and commuters. Inner cities are frequently places of cultural diversity; this brings many benefits but can also lead to challenges such as language barriers, tensions between groups or unequal access to services.

At the same time, some inner-city areas experience gentrification: wealthier residents move in, renovate properties and attract cafés and boutiques. Gentrification can improve the built environment and increase investment, but it can also displace long-term residents through rising rents and a loss of local character. When you write about these issues in exams, aim to show both the human impacts (loss of community, stress on families) and the environmental consequences (pollution, pressure on green spaces).

## Regeneration and urban planning: aims, approaches and evaluation
Urban regeneration covers the planned actions to revive declining areas. Regeneration aims typically include improving housing, creating jobs, upgrading transport and enhancing the environment. Approaches range from large-scale redevelopment and flagship projects to more modest schemes such as retrofitting brownfield land, improving parks and facilitating small business start-ups. Successful schemes usually combine physical change with social and economic measures, for example providing affordable housing, training and support for local businesses.

An example often used in teaching is the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, a brownfield waterfront regeneration project that has combined cultural investment (a visitor centre), mixed-use development, office space and new housing to attract visitors, workers and residents back to a former industrial area. When evaluating any scheme, consider questions of sustainability and fairness: does the project protect or increase affordable housing? Does it create long-term local employment rather than short-term construction jobs? Has the local community been consulted and involved? Regeneration can bring clear benefits, but the best answers weigh gains against costs, such as displacement, increased living costs and changing neighbourhood identity.

## Urbanisation and shanty towns in LEDCs
Rapid urbanisation in less economically developed countries (LEDCs) creates different pressures. Cities often grow faster than formal housing and services can be provided, producing informal settlements or shanty towns. These areas are typically located on land that is cheap or marginal: steep slopes, riverbanks or disused industrial land. Housing is often self-built using temporary materials, with high population density, poor sanitation, insecure tenure and limited access to water, electricity and waste disposal. Residents usually work in the informal economy, in small-scale trade, construction or services.

Kolkata is an example where long-term urban growth has produced extensive informal settlements alongside formal urban areas. In studying LEDC shanty towns you should explain causes—rural–urban migration driven by perceived job opportunities, lack of affordable formal housing, and weak planning enforcement—and consequences for health, safety and environment. When discussing responses, describe a range of measures from slum upgrading, provision of basic services and secure land tenure, to relocation and new social housing programmes; evaluate trade-offs such as the disruption caused by relocation and the potential loss of livelihoods.

## Using maps, photographs and fieldwork to study urban change
Geographical skills are central to understanding urban change. Interpreting OS maps, aerial photographs and satellite images lets you identify land uses, transport networks and signs of regeneration. Sketch maps and annotated cross-sections can show how land use changes from the centre to the suburbs. Fieldwork is equally important: simple surveys such as land use mapping, traffic counts, pedestrian flow observations and questionnaires of local residents reveal patterns and attitudes in real places. When planning fieldwork choose an aim and at least two testable hypotheses, record primary data carefully using structured sheets, and make sure you understand safety and ethical issues.

For the GCSE Fieldwork unit you must produce a short, word-processed fieldwork statement and a clear table of data to bring into the exam. The statement should include a title, the aim and hypotheses, and the study location. The table must present the primary quantitative data required for analysing your aim. In the exam you will not be marked on the statement itself, but you will use your fieldwork experience to answer questions on planning, analysis, conclusions and evaluation. Good fieldwork links directly to urban topics: for example, you might investigate whether recent regeneration has changed pedestrian numbers or resident satisfaction in an inner-city neighbourhood.

## Sustainable and inclusive approaches to urban change
Sustainability and inclusiveness are central criteria for judging urban strategies. A sustainable approach balances economic growth, social equity and environmental protection. Practical elements include mixed-use development to reduce travel needs, public transport improvements, affordable housing policies, green infrastructure to manage runoff and improve air quality, and community-led regeneration that keeps local people involved. Fairness means considering who benefits and who loses from change: for instance, new shops and nicer streets may raise local pride but also push out lower-income households unless affordable housing is provided.

You should be able to compare hard engineering or large-scale redevelopment with softer, community-focused measures. Hard solutions such as demolition and rebuild can be efficient at removing poor-quality housing but may break social networks. Soft approaches like refurbishment, community land trusts and incremental upgrading often preserve neighbourhood ties but may take longer and need sustained funding. Effective answers will judge each strategy against clear sustainability criteria and explain outcomes with appropriate examples.

## Exam technique
Approach each question by first identifying exactly what it asks: does it require description, explanation, analysis, evaluation or a decision? Start extended answers with a concise definition of key terms, then organise your response logically. For short questions keep answers focused and factual. For 6–9 mark questions use a clear structure of point, evidence and explanation: make a point, illustrate it with a specific example or data (your case study), and explain why that evidence supports the point. For evaluation questions make sure to consider more than one side: list advantages and disadvantages, judge impacts in social, economic and environmental terms, and reach a balanced conclusion that refers back to sustainability and fairness.

When using case studies, name the place and give specific, relevant details rather than vague generalities. If a question asks for map or photograph interpretation, refer to observable features (building density, road patterns, presence of parks or industrial sites) and explain what those features imply about land use and change. Use simple labelled sketches or cross-sections where helpful; these can gain marks if they are clear and explained in the text. Manage your time in Unit 2’s 1 hour 30 minute paper by allocating roughly 20–25 minutes per theme question, leaving a few minutes to review answers. For the fieldwork exam bring your statement and table of data, make sure your answers reference your actual methods and findings, identify anomalies and limitations honestly, and suggest realistic improvements. Finally, check your spelling, specialist vocabulary and the clarity of your conclusions—quality of written communication is assessed in extended responses.
