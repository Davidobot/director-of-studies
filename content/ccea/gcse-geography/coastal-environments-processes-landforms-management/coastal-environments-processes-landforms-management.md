# Coastal environments: processes, landforms & management (GCSE Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: why coasts matter and the big ideas
Coastlines are dynamic zones where the land meets the sea and where physical processes and human activity interact closely. For GCSE Geography, the coast is a place to study how waves, tides and currents shape different landforms, why people choose to live and work in coastal areas, and how societies try to manage risks such as erosion and flooding. Key concepts that run through the topic include the interrelationships between people and the natural environment, sustainable development, and the need to balance economic, social and environmental objectives when planning coastal protection. Coasts are important economically for tourism, fishing and ports; socially for settlements and recreation; and environmentally for habitats and biodiversity. At the same time, they are vulnerable to storm events and to long-term change such as sea level rise, so understanding coastal processes and management options is essential.

## Processes shaping the coast: waves, erosion, transport and deposition
Waves are the primary agents of coastal change. They gain energy from wind, and their size and power depend on wind speed, duration and fetch — the distance over which the wind blows across open water. Constructive waves tend to be low and long with a stronger forward movement called the swash than the backward movement called the backwash; they encourage deposition and form beaches. Destructive waves are steeper, higher and have a more powerful backwash than swash; they erode the coast.

Erosion at the coast occurs by a combination of processes. Hydraulic action involves the force of water compressing air in cracks and joints, eventually breaking rock apart. Abrasion (sometimes called corrasion) happens when rock fragments and sediment thrown by waves grind down rock surfaces. Attrition reduces the size of transported material as particles collide and break apart. Solution (or corrosion) dissolves soluble minerals in rocks such as limestone. Longshore drift is the dominant transport process along many coasts: waves approach the shore at an angle, carrying sediment up the beach with the swash and back down at right angles with the backwash; repeated swash and backwash move material sideways along the shore. Where waves lose energy, sediment is deposited, creating features such as beaches, spits and tombolos.

Understanding how energy varies along the coast helps explain why different landforms develop. Rocky headlands that stick out into the sea receive the full force of incoming waves and tend to be sites of intense erosion. Bays, in contrast, are more sheltered and often accumulate deposited material, forming beaches.

## Erosional landforms: cliffs, wave-cut platforms, caves, arches and stacks
When waves concentrate their energy on a headland, cliffs are carved and retreat inland over time. The base of the cliff is often undermined by hydraulic action and abrasion forming a wave-cut notch. As erosion continues, the rock above becomes unstable and collapses, leaving a more vertical cliff face and, at low tide, a gently sloping wave-cut platform exposed across the foreshore.

Headlands with weaknesses such as joints or faults commonly develop caves where waves exploit lines of weakness. Continued erosion enlarges caves until they cut through a headland to form an arch. Over time the arch may collapse as its roof becomes unsupported, leaving an isolated pillar of rock called a stack. Further erosion reduces the stack to a stump. Classic examples visible in the UK include the limestone arch of Durdle Door on the Jurassic Coast and the stacks along parts of the Scottish and Pembrokeshire coasts; these illustrate the sequence from cave to arch to stack and stump.

When explaining the formation of these features in an exam answer, it is useful to refer to the processes (hydraulic action, abrasion, solution) and to use annotated cross-sectional diagrams that show the wave-cut notch, cliff retreat and the wave-cut platform.

## Depositional landforms: beaches, spits, tombolos and barrier beaches
Where energy falls, sediment is deposited and builds depositional landforms. Sandy beaches are formed where fine sediment dominates and waves help sort material so that sand accumulates in gentler foreshore slopes. Shingle beaches, composed of pebbles and cobbles, tend to be steeper because larger particles are harder for the backwash to move. Beaches can change seasonally: in summer constructive waves deposit sand forming wide, gentle beaches, while in winter destructive waves remove material and steepen the beach.

Spits form where longshore drift transports sediment past a change in the coastline or across the mouth of a bay. The spit grows outwards into open water until wave energy disperses the material or until it meets a change in wind direction; hooked or recurved spits develop where prevailing winds and waves shift direction at the spit’s end. Spurn Head on the Holderness coast of England is a well-known example of a large spit formed by longshore drift. Tombolos are depositional features that join an island to the mainland, formed when material deposited by longshore drift or wave refraction accumulates in the sheltered area between them, Chesil Beach in Dorset being an example of a distinctive shingle ridge connecting landforms.

In exam answers, describe the role of longshore drift and include a simple labelled sketch showing the angle of wave approach, swash and backwash, and how sediment moves along the shore.

## Coastal management: hard and soft engineering and sustainability
Human communities protect coasts for many reasons: to defend settlements, infrastructure and farmland; to preserve beaches for tourism; and to conserve habitats. Management options are often described as hard engineering or soft engineering. Hard engineering involves building structures such as sea walls, rock armour (rip-rap), groynes and revetments to directly resist wave action. These methods can be effective in the short term for protecting property, but they are expensive, can require high maintenance, and sometimes transfer the problem elsewhere by interrupting natural sediment flows. Groynes, for example, trap sediment on their updrift side but can starve beaches further along the coast.

Soft engineering works more with natural processes. Beach nourishment adds sand or shingle to widen a beach and increase natural protection; dune regeneration and planting can stabilise sandy shorelines; managed retreat (or managed realignment) allows certain low-value areas to flood, creating salt marshes that absorb wave energy and provide natural habitats. The choice between hard and soft approaches should be guided by consideration of sustainability, including environmental impacts, costs, long-term effectiveness and social acceptability. Integrated coastal zone management seeks to balance these factors and to involve local communities and stakeholders in decision-making.

When evaluating coastal management in an exam, consider the physical context (wave energy, geology, sediment supply), economic costs and benefits, impacts on ecosystems, and whether the chosen strategy is likely to be sustainable in the face of sea level rise and increased storminess due to climate change. A strong evaluation will compare alternative options and explain trade-offs rather than simply listing advantages and disadvantages.

## Case studies and applying knowledge to places
Case studies turn theory into concrete examples and help you show detailed knowledge in exams. The GCSE specification suggests using at least one coastal management case study from the British Isles; Newcastle, County Down is an example named in the specification. When studying a real location you should include specific facts and figures where possible: what defences exist, when were they built, what were the costs and local impacts, and how successful have they been over time. Holderness on England’s east coast is a useful contrasting example because it shows rapid natural erosion of soft boulder clay cliffs and the consequences for villages, farmland and transport links. Spurn Head illustrates spit formation and the challenges of maintaining a narrow, shifting depositional feature. Durdle Door on the Jurassic Coast is an accessible example of coastal erosion producing a limestone arch.

Good case studies also draw in sustainability considerations. For example, managed retreat schemes may involve short-term loss of farmland but long-term gains in natural flood storage and habitat creation. Beach nourishment can protect tourist economies but must be repeated over time, so its lifetime costs matter. When you write about a case study, place it in a wider context: describe the physical processes at work, the social and economic reasons for intervention, and the outcomes—both intended and unintended.

## Fieldwork and skills for studying coasts
Fieldwork is central to coastal geography. Typical investigations include measuring beach profiles, sampling sediment size and shape, surveying the extent of coastal features, and monitoring wave direction and tide data. A useful field study will have a clear aim and at least two testable hypotheses, use appropriate primary and secondary sources, and record data precisely using standard units so that graphs and statistical analysis are possible. For beach studies, methods such as systematic pebble sampling along transects and recording beach gradient with a clinometer or ranging poles allow you to test ideas about how sediment size varies with exposure or distance from a groyne. Always be clear about safety and risk assessments for fieldwork near cliffs and in tidal areas.

Processing fieldwork data should use appropriate graphical and cartographic techniques: cross-sectional diagrams to show beach profiles, histograms or cumulative frequency graphs for sediment size, and annotated maps for feature locations. When analysing data, link observations back to coastal processes and theory, identify anomalies and potential sources of error, and draw evidence-based conclusions. Fieldwork answers in exams and in the Unit 3 fieldwork worksheet should explain methods and limitations and suggest how the investigation could be improved or extended.

## Exam technique
When answering coastal questions in exams, begin by reading the question carefully and noting command words such as "describe", "explain", "evaluate" or "assess". Use accurate geographical terms — for example, differentiate between swash and backwash, or between hydraulic action and abrasion — and make sure you include process language to show cause and effect. Where diagrams are allowed or helpful, draw neat, labelled sketches to support your explanation: an annotated cross-section of a cliff showing a wave-cut notch and platform, or a plan sketch showing longshore drift and spit formation, can earn marks quickly and clarify your reasoning.

For extended answers, structure your response with a clear introduction, development and conclusion. When asked to evaluate coastal management, weigh the environmental, social and economic factors, compare hard and soft engineering options, and refer to sustainability principles. Use case study detail to support points — dates, types of defences, local impacts and any measurable results strengthen answers — but avoid inventing figures. If a local or named case study is not required, choose one you know well and be consistent in the details you give.

Practice interpreting maps, aerial photographs and OS map extracts: questions may ask you to identify landforms, deduce processes from patterns, or suggest suitable management strategies based on map evidence. In fieldwork questions, be ready to justify your methods, explain how you processed your data, identify anomalies and suggest improvements; remember that for Unit 3 you must submit a word-processed fieldwork statement and table of data with your exam script.

Finally, manage your time in the exam so that you answer all parts of each question, use paragraphs for clarity, and proofread to correct any ambiguous language. Clear diagrams, precise terminology and well-reasoned evaluations are the most reliable ways to gain marks in the coastal section of the GCSE Geography exam.
