# Fieldwork skills (CCEA Unit 3): planning, data collection & evaluation (GCSE Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Why fieldwork matters and what CCEA expects
Fieldwork is the part of geography where classroom theory meets the real world. CCEA’s Unit 3 expects you to carry out a small investigation linked to themes from Unit 1 (physical geography) or Unit 2 (human geography), to plan it carefully, to collect and present primary and secondary data, to analyse your results using geographical ideas, and to evaluate the whole process. The examination is generic: you will write about the process and use the fieldwork statement and a table of data that you prepare in advance and attach to your exam script. Although the statement and table are not directly marked, they are essential evidence you will refer to throughout the paper, so they must be clear, accurate and professional.

## Choosing and planning an investigation
A strong fieldwork enquiry begins with a clear, focused aim and at least two testable hypotheses. The aim should be specific and manageable in the time and with the resources you have; it should also link to a wider geographical concept such as processes, human impacts or sustainability. For example, if you study rivers you might aim to investigate how channel width and pebble size change downstream; if you choose urban geography, your aim could be to compare pedestrian flows and shop types between a town centre and a nearby shopping park. From that aim you should develop hypotheses that make measurable predictions, such as “channel width increases with distance downstream” or “there are more comparison shops in the shopping park than in the town centre”.

Site selection matters because it affects safety, accessibility and the strength of your data. Choose locations where the phenomenon you want to study is visible and where you can take repeatable measurements. Consider the timing of the visit: tides, recent weather, school schedule and seasonal changes can all influence your results. Before you go, carry out basic reconnaissance using maps, satellite images or local reports so that your fieldwork statement can include a clear description of the location and a small-scale map if appropriate.

Planning also includes a simple risk assessment and ethical considerations. Think about hazards such as traffic, water, steep slopes or unstable surfaces, and how you will reduce those risks for everyone involved. Consider permission for private land, whether interviewees need consent, and how you will treat personal data. These practicalities are part of the enquiry process and should be rehearsed in advance.

## Selecting methods and equipment for reliable primary data
Good fieldwork uses appropriate methods and equipment chosen to reduce measurement error and bias while ensuring safety. Your choice will depend on your aim. For physical investigations you might use tape measures, ranging poles, clinometers, flow meters or sediment sieves. For coastal work a simple beach profile using measured levels along a transect can illustrate beach morphology. For human geography you might use timed counts, questionnaires, land use surveys, pedestrian flow tallies or sound level meters.

Sampling strategy affects how generalisable your results are. A systematic transect across a river channel or beach gives a structured picture of change along a line, while stratified sampling can ensure you assess each relevant zone (for example, CBD, inner city and suburbs). Random sampling reduces selection bias for variables like pebble size or soil moisture, but it must be practicable. Always take multiple measurements and repeat readings where possible to increase reliability. Record exact methods and any calibrations; if you use an instrument such as an anemometer or pH probe, note the model and how it was set up so someone reading your fieldwork statement understands how the data were gathered.

CCEA requires you to use both primary and secondary sources. Secondary data could be Ordnance Survey maps, stream gauge records, Met Office data, historical statistics, census tables or satellite imagery. Use secondary sources to place your primary data in context, to check whether your sample is typical, and to extend your conclusions beyond the limits of a single visit.

## Recording data clearly and presenting it effectively
Recording data accurately while in the field is essential. Use a pre-designed recording sheet with clear headings, precise units and space for repeated measures. Record the time and date, weather conditions and any events that might influence the measurements. For quantitative work always include units (metres, mm, seconds, degrees Celsius) and ensure column headings are unambiguous. If you collect qualitative observations—such as descriptions of land use or interview responses—note who said what and under what circumstances.

When presenting your data, choose methods that make the relationships you want to show easiest to interpret. Graphical presentations should be appropriate: line graphs for continuous variables over distance or time, scattergraphs for relationships between two numerical variables, bar charts for categorical comparisons, and pie charts only for clear proportional displays. Cartographic presentation such as transect maps, proportional symbol maps or annotated field sketches can convey spatial patterns very effectively. Use ICT where possible: spreadsheets make calculations and graphing quicker and allow you to use trendlines, basic statistics and clearer presentation. If you use GIS, you can overlay your primary measurements on maps which helps demonstrate spatial relationships. Always label axes, include units and give each figure a descriptive title. If you hand-draw a sketch in the exam, make sure it is neat, annotated and directly linked to your data.

## Analysing data: linking evidence to geographical theory
Analysis is where your fieldwork turns into geography. Quantitative analysis can include calculating means, ranges and percentages, plotting scattergraphs and interpreting correlation coefficients where appropriate. Do not rely on statistics you cannot explain: simple descriptive statistics and clear graphical trends are both powerful and acceptable at GCSE. When you find a relationship, explain it using relevant geographical theory. For example, if velocity increases downstream in a river study, relate that to channel shape, gradient and load; if pedestrian counts are higher in the CBD, connect this to land use, accessibility and central place theory.

Always look for links between different sets of data. A classic example is linking channel width and pebble size to discharge and gradient in a river long profile. In urban fieldwork you might link pedestrian numbers to shop types and accessibility. Use secondary data to test whether your local findings fit wider patterns: does your river’s discharge match gauge records, or do your local survey responses reflect census information about age structure or employment?

Anomalies are not failures; they are evidence to be explained. If a measurement deviates markedly from the rest, first consider simple causes such as equipment error, recording mistakes or temporary local factors like recent rainfall or a festival. Describe how you checked the anomaly, whether you re-measured, and how that affects your confidence in conclusions.

## Drawing conclusions and writing a balanced evaluation
Conclusions should be evidence-based and linked back to the original aim and hypotheses. State clearly whether each hypothesis was supported or refuted by your data, and use figures to justify your claims. Avoid making sweeping generalisations that your data do not support; instead, describe what your results demonstrate about the specific place and how far those conclusions might apply elsewhere.

Evaluation is a requirement of CCEA’s Unit 3 and is an opportunity to show critical thinking. Discuss reliability by considering sample size, repeatability, and measurement precision. Consider validity by asking how well your methods measured what you set out to investigate; for instance, a single day’s traffic count may not reflect typical patterns, and a basic in-field pH reading may be affected by surface contamination. Reflect on bias in sampling or question design, the limitations of using secondary data, and the effects of temporal constraints. Suggest practical improvements such as increasing sample size, using more precise instruments, sampling at different times or seasons, employing blind questionnaires to reduce interviewer bias, or combining field measurements with longer-term datasets. Propose meaningful extensions: repeated monitoring, laboratory tests of water samples, or spatial analysis using GIS to examine broader patterns.

Be candid and specific in your evaluation. Examiners reward evidence of thoughtful reflection: identifying a real limitation and proposing a realistic solution is worth more than repeating generic phrases about needing “more data”.

## Preparing the fieldwork statement and table of data for the exam
CCEA requires a concise, word-processed fieldwork statement and a clear table of data to be brought into the Unit 3 exam. The fieldwork statement must include a title, the aim and the minimum two hypotheses, and the location of the study—this can include a small map or clear directions. Do not expand the statement into a full report; other elements of the investigation must not be included in the statement. The table of data should contain the primary data essential for investigating your aim, quantitative measurements for graphical work, all variables clearly named with units, and normal conventions such as a title and column headings. If you used any secondary data that is central to your analysis you should include it alongside your primary table or indicate its source clearly.

Though these documents are not marked, they form the basis of the answers you will write in the exam, so prepare them neatly and professionally. Use spreadsheets to produce a clean table, check for transcription mistakes, and keep copies. At the exam, attach the statement and table to your script as instructed.

## Exam technique
In the exam, time management and clarity matter. Begin by making sure your fieldwork statement and table are attached as required. Read each question carefully and plan short answers before you write; where the question asks you to use your fieldwork, explicitly refer to your data, quoting figures to support points. When asked about methodology, describe the methods you used, why they were appropriate, and any steps you took to increase reliability such as repeats or calibration. For analysis questions, present key calculations or describe how you processed the data, and link findings to geographical theory or wider contexts. Where you discuss anomalies or limitations, be specific about causes and the practical steps you would take to check or correct them.

Use diagrams, sketches and simple graphs where they help to make a point; ensure each has a title, labeled axes and units. Keep answers focused and avoid lengthy unrelated description. Quality of written communication is assessed, so write clearly, use geographical terms correctly, and structure longer answers into short paragraphs with a clear line of argument. In evaluation and conclusion sections, prioritise the most important limitations and improvements rather than listing many minor points. Finally, check your units, spellings of place names and that your final conclusion answers the original aim and states whether your hypotheses were supported. A well-prepared fieldwork statement and tidy data table will make demonstrating all of this much easier, so invest time before the exam in producing both to a high standard.
