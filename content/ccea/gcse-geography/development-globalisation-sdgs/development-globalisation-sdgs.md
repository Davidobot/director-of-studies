# Development, globalisation & sustainable development goals (SDGs) (GCSE Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview and key ideas
This topic brings together human processes that shape how countries develop, how people, goods and ideas move around the world, and how the global community is trying to make development fairer and more sustainable. At GCSE level you should be able to explain differences between more economically developed countries (MEDCs) and less economically developed countries (LEDCs), describe the forces that drive migration and urban change, and evaluate strategies designed to reduce inequalities. Central ideas are interdependence (how countries rely on one another), sustainable development (meeting present needs without harming the future), and international cooperation through instruments such as the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Throughout the topic you will use place-based examples to support arguments and practise map, data and fieldwork skills so you can apply knowledge to real situations.

## Geographical concepts and skills
You are expected to apply a set of core concepts and a range of practical skills. Concepts include interrelationships between people and the environment, the need to manage resources, global interdependence and sustainable development. Skills include map reading (grid references, scale and relief), interpreting aerial photographs and satellite images, reading synoptic charts, and using simple GIS outputs. Data skills are important: you should be comfortable drawing and interpreting graphs and maps, using spreadsheets to spot patterns, and evaluating sources of evidence. In fieldwork you will form aims and hypotheses, select suitable methods, collect primary and secondary data, present results using tables, charts and annotated sketches, identify anomalies, draw evidence-based conclusions and evaluate the reliability and limitations of your investigation.

## Development and measures of progress
Understanding development starts with the indicators used to measure it. Economic indicators such as GDP per head and income levels show wealth, while social indicators such as life expectancy, literacy and access to healthcare reveal quality of life. Composite measures such as the Human Development Index (HDI) combine several indicators to give a broader picture. The demographic transition model explains how birth and death rates change as countries develop, producing population pyramids that show aged-dependent populations in many MEDCs and youth-dependent populations in many LEDCs. Historical legacies, environmental constraints, dependence on primary industries and debt can all hinder development. To reduce the development gap, strategies range from fair trade and appropriate technology to international programmes under the SDGs. Appropriate technology examples include solar cookers and the Hippo Water Roller, which are designed to be low-cost, simple to maintain and locally useful. Fair trade can help producers in LEDCs secure better prices and more stable incomes; for revision, think of fair trade coffee as an example that links producer welfare with consumer choices in richer countries.

## Globalisation: how it helps and hinders development
Globalisation describes the increasing movement of goods, services, money, people and ideas across borders. It has helped development by bringing foreign investment, new technologies and export markets, creating jobs and stimulating growth. A BRICS country such as China illustrates this: foreign direct investment, export-led manufacturing and large-scale urbanisation have driven rapid economic growth. However, globalisation can also deepen inequalities within and between countries, create environmental pressures, and expose local industries to volatile global markets. You should be able to use a case study to show both sides of this story: for example, rapid industrial growth in China has raised living standards for many, but it has also produced regional disparities, urban slums in some cities and serious air pollution problems. When answering exam questions, explain processes (how transnational companies invest, how supply chains work) and then weigh benefits against costs for people and the environment.

## The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and international cooperation
The 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs provide a global framework for tackling poverty, inequality, environmental degradation and climate change. For GCSE purposes it helps to know how three or four SDGs work in practice. Goal 1 (No Poverty) focuses on reducing extreme poverty through economic inclusion and social protection. Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) supports access to safe water and hygiene, directly relevant to health and education in LEDCs. Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) promotes renewable energy technologies, which link to local solutions such as micro-hydro, solar panels and wind turbines. International agreements, notably the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, illustrate how countries can cooperate to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In your answers show how global targets translate to local action—such as funding for renewable energy projects, capacity-building for clean water systems, or support for sustainable agriculture—and be ready to evaluate successes and limits, for example funding gaps or political resistance.

## Applying the ideas: population, urban change and managing the environment
Population and migration shape many development challenges. You will need to explain push and pull factors for migration, barriers such as visas and physical obstacles, and the different challenges faced by economic migrants and refugees. A recent real-world example is the movement of Syrian refugees into Greece and across Europe: this case highlights humanitarian needs, host-country pressures on services, and international responses. Urban change requires balancing regeneration in MEDC inner cities with the problems of rapid urbanisation in LEDCs. Regeneration projects such as the Titanic Quarter in Belfast show how planners aim to improve housing, transport and jobs, while shanty towns (for example in Kolkata) illustrate the rapid, unplanned growth of housing with limited services. Environmental management considers the human impacts driving climate change—greenhouse gas emissions and growing carbon footprints—and responses such as the waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle), renewable energy (wind farms, solar installations) and sustainable tourism. Ecotourism, when well managed as in parts of Costa Rica, can provide income while preserving ecosystems and promoting local engagement.

## Fieldwork and data skills in practice
Fieldwork brings theory to life and is assessed by a one-hour examination where you base answers on your own fieldwork experience. Good fieldwork starts with a clear question, a precise aim and at least two testable hypotheses, and it includes a risk assessment and a plan for collecting primary and secondary data. Choose variables that can be measured quantitatively so that you can produce graphs and carry out comparisons; include qualitative observations where they add context. Use appropriate equipment and recording sheets, follow sampling techniques that reduce bias, and keep accurate notes of location and methods. In the exam you will attach a short fieldwork statement and a table of data—these must follow normal conventions for titles, variables and units. When analysing data, link your findings to relevant geographical theory, identify anomalies and limitations, and suggest improvements or extensions. Remember that evaluation and reflection are as important as the results: explaining why a method was limited or how you would refine the study demonstrates higher-level understanding.

## Exam technique
Approach each question by identifying what it asks you to do—describe, explain, assess, evaluate—and aim your answer at that command word. For factual recall use specific, accurate examples and relevant numbers where possible; for explanation show causal links (for example, how hydraulic action leads to cliff retreat and then to the formation of a wave-cut platform). When asked to evaluate or assess, weigh strengths and weaknesses and refer to sustainability or long-term consequences. Make full use of the command of geographical terminology that examiners expect: terms such as drainage basin, longshore drift, demographic transition, dependency ratio, HDI, and interdependence should be used precisely. Use diagrams and annotated sketches where they add clarity, labelling key features and using them to support your written points. In papers with resource material read the sources carefully and integrate them—use data from maps, photographs or charts to support your interpretation rather than repeating the stimulus material. Manage your time so that extended response questions get structured answers with an introduction, development and conclusion; in the fieldwork paper bring your fieldwork statement and table of data and refer to them explicitly when explaining methods, results and evaluations. Practice past papers under timed conditions, self-mark against mark schemes and learn a handful of well-prepared case studies with concrete details so that you can adapt them to different questions. Clear, well-organised writing, accurate spelling and correct units all contribute to higher marks, so plan answers briefly before writing and check your work if time allows.
