# Managing resources & the environment: climate change, energy, waste & tourism (GCSE Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: why managing resources and the environment matters
Managing resources and the environment brings together physical and human geography because people depend on and change the natural world. The issues are global and local at once: climate change, energy supply, waste management and tourism affect ecosystems, livelihoods and economies everywhere. At GCSE level you will be expected to explain key processes, evaluate strategies, and apply fieldwork skills to investigate real places. Knowing the basic science behind the greenhouse effect, the advantages and limits of renewable energy, the practical meaning of the waste hierarchy, and the difference between mass tourism and ecotourism will help you make evidence-based judgements about sustainable development and the interdependence of countries.

## Climate change: causes, consequences and responses
Climate change is driven by the greenhouse effect, which keeps Earth warm by trapping some outgoing heat in the atmosphere. Human activities release additional greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and methane from agriculture, increasing the planet’s average temperatures. The concept of a carbon footprint helps us measure the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with an individual, organisation or product. The impacts of climate change are wide-ranging: rising sea levels threaten coastlines and small islands, changes in rainfall patterns increase flood and drought risk, and warmer temperatures alter growing seasons and ecosystems. These environmental effects have social and economic consequences, whether through damage to homes and infrastructure, threats to food security, or losses to tourism and fisheries.

Responses to climate change fall into two broad categories: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example by switching from coal and oil to low-carbon energy, increasing energy efficiency or protecting forests. Adaptation involves preparing for and reducing harm from unavoidable changes, such as building flood defences, changing agricultural practices, or planning managed retreat in vulnerable coastal areas. International cooperation is central; the 2015 International Climate Change Agreement, often called the Paris Agreement, set out a framework for countries to limit global temperature rise and to support adaptation in vulnerable countries. When you write about climate change in exams, balance the physical science with human responses and consider both global agreements and local examples of adaptation and mitigation.

## Energy and appropriate technology
Energy provision is a key resource issue that links directly to climate change. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and biofuels are promoted as sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels because they produce little or no direct carbon dioxide when generating electricity. Wind farms offer a practical example: they produce renewable power on a large scale and are now common in many countries, but they have limitations such as visual impact, noise concerns for nearby residents, potential effects on bird populations, and intermittency when the wind does not blow. Solar energy is flexible and increasingly affordable; small-scale technologies such as solar cookers can transform daily life in rural areas with no grid access. Appropriate technology is a useful concept here: it describes simple, affordable, and locally maintainable devices that fit the social and environmental context of a place. Examples used in teaching include the solar cooker, which reduces fuelwood demand and indoor smoke, and the Hippo Water Roller, which makes it easier to transport water and reduces the time children spend collecting water. When evaluating a technology, consider cost, cultural acceptability, maintenance requirements, and overall sustainability.

Energy choices illustrate interdependence between countries. Many nations import fossil fuels, while others export them; shifting to renewables can change these economic relationships and reduce vulnerability to volatile global markets. In your answers, include advantages and disadvantages of specific energy options and consider their sustainability using environmental, economic and social criteria.

## Waste management and the waste hierarchy
Waste management is another aspect of resource use that affects the environment and human health. The waste hierarchy sets out preferred options for dealing with waste, starting with prevention, then reuse, then recycling, and finally energy recovery and disposal as the least desirable. Prevention and reduction are the most sustainable because they avoid creating waste in the first place, while recycling conserves resources and reduces the need for new raw materials. Local schemes vary widely: kerbside recycling, bottle deposits, composting programmes and municipal waste-to-energy plants are all examples of approaches you might study.

Evaluating waste strategies requires consideration of benefits and trade-offs. Recycling reduces landfill pressure and resource extraction, but collection and processing have costs and sometimes limited markets for recycled material. Incineration reduces the volume of waste and can generate electricity, but it may release pollutants and can discourage recycling if it provides a cheap disposal route. In exam answers, explain the principles of reduce, reuse and recycle, use local or national examples where relevant, and be ready to assess how practical and sustainable different methods are for particular places.

## Tourism: mass tourism, ecotourism and sustainability
Tourism is a resource-intensive industry with important cultural, economic and environmental effects. Mass tourism can bring prosperity through jobs, infrastructure and foreign exchange, but it can also cause crowding, habitat destruction, pollution, cultural commodification and strain on water and waste systems. Popular beach resorts and historic city centres often face pressure from large visitor numbers, while fragile environments such as coral reefs and mountain ecosystems are particularly vulnerable.

Ecotourism offers a more sustainable model by emphasising small-scale operations, community involvement, conservation and environmental education. Well-designed ecotourism projects can protect habitats, generate local income and encourage stewardship of natural resources. Costa Rica is a commonly used example because of its protected areas and tourism that promotes biodiversity conservation. However, even ecotourism can fail if poorly managed: local communities must receive real benefits, visitor numbers must be kept within ecological limits, and infrastructure must be appropriate to the landscape. When discussing tourism in exams, weigh the cultural, economic and environmental impacts, explain what makes tourism sustainable, and use case studies to show how different strategies have worked in practice.

## Fieldwork and investigative skills
Fieldwork is central to geography because it links classroom theory to real places and provides primary data for investigation. A rigorous fieldwork enquiry begins with a clear aim and testable hypotheses, followed by careful planning that includes risk assessment and selection of appropriate methods. Both primary and secondary sources are important: you might measure stream velocity and channel shape on a river study while using historical flood records or map data as secondary sources. Accuracy and reliability depend on method choice and how data are recorded; the specification expects students to select methods that suit the question and to record measurements using standard conventions and units.

Processing and presenting data is key to convincing analysis. You should be able to choose suitable graphical and cartographic techniques, produce legible graphs and annotated maps, and explain why those methods were chosen. Analysis requires linking data sets, identifying patterns and anomalies, and drawing evidence-based conclusions. Evaluation is equally important: a strong fieldwork answer describes limitations, suggests improvements, and reflects on the validity of conclusions. For the GCSE fieldwork paper you must prepare and bring a short, word-processed fieldwork statement and a table of data to the exam. The statement must include a title, the aim and the hypotheses, and location details; the table must contain the primary quantitative data essential to the investigation and follow normal conventions so that your examiner can reproduce your reasoning. Although these attachments are not marked directly, they are vital because your answers in the exam will be based on them.

## Linking the local to the global: sustainable development and case studies
Throughout the topics of climate change, energy, waste and tourism it is important to apply the principles of sustainable development. This means considering environmental protection, social equity and economic viability together when judging strategies. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, adopted as part of the 2030 Agenda, provide a framework for tackling poverty, inequality and environmental degradation simultaneously; in GCSE answers you can describe how particular goals, such as affordable clean energy or sustainable cities, aim to reduce development gaps and build resilience.

Case studies help bring theory to life. Use an example from the British Isles when required, such as the 2014 Somerset Levels floods to discuss river flooding causes and responses, or Newcastle, County Down, for coastal management. For river or coastal management evaluations, consider both hard engineering options, like dams or sea walls, and soft engineering options, like managed retreat or beach nourishment, and judge them against sustainability criteria. When studying global examples, select an MEDC and an LEDC case where appropriate: the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami provide contrasting lessons about preparedness and response, while the Mississippi River’s management illustrates combined technological and policy approaches to flood risk.

## Exam technique
Answering geography papers successfully requires clear knowledge, careful use of evidence and controlled writing. Begin each question by reading the resource material and the question stem carefully, noting command words such as describe, explain, evaluate or assess. Use appropriate place-specific facts and figures where possible to support your points; a named example makes answers more convincing. Structure extended answers with a brief introduction that sets out your approach, a series of linked paragraphs that develop points using evidence, and a short conclusion that brings together your judgement. For evaluation questions balance advantages and disadvantages and reach a final judgement that refers back to sustainability or the assessment criteria you have been given.

Time management is essential. Allocate time in proportion to the marks available and leave a few minutes at the end to check spelling, punctuation and the clarity of your written communication. In questions requiring fieldwork knowledge, be explicit about your aim and hypotheses, explain your data collection methods and justify the techniques used to present and analyse the data. When attaching your fieldwork statement and table of data to the Unit 3 script, ensure they are clear, labelled and follow the conventions required; examiners will use them to interpret your answers. Practice interpreting maps, diagrams, synoptic charts and photographs so you can extract relevant detail quickly in the exam.

Finally, connect AO1, AO2 and AO3 skills in your responses by demonstrating accurate geographical knowledge, applying that knowledge to interpret evidence, and showing competence with skills and techniques. Use specialist vocabulary when appropriate, but write clearly and coherently so your meaning is unmistakable. With focused revision of key concepts, well-chosen case studies and regular practice of written answers and fieldwork tasks, you will be well prepared to manage the topics of climate change, energy, waste and tourism at GCSE.
