# Plate tectonics, earthquakes & volcanoes (GCSE Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview of the restless Earth
The Earth’s surface is not a single unbroken shell but is divided into large and small plates that move slowly over the hot, semi‑plastic mantle beneath. This movement, driven by convection currents in the mantle, is responsible for many of the planet’s most dramatic features and events: the formation of mountain ranges, the creation of new ocean floor, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Understanding plate tectonics gives you a framework for explaining why these processes occur where they do and how they shape both physical landscapes and human lives. At GCSE level you need to be able to describe the structure of the Earth—inner core, outer core, mantle and crust—and to explain how the motion of plates produces different landforms and hazards at plate margins.

## Plate boundaries and the landforms they create
Different types of plate margins create distinctive landforms because plates interact in different ways. At constructive margins, where plates move apart, magma rises to fill the gap and cools to form new oceanic crust. This is seen at mid‑ocean ridges such as the Mid‑Atlantic Ridge, and on land it can create volcanic activity and rift valleys. Destructive or subduction margins occur where an oceanic plate meets a continental plate; the denser oceanic plate sinks beneath the lighter continental plate, forming deep ocean trenches and volcanic mountain chains. The Andes are a classic example of volcanism related to subduction. Collision zones form where two continental plates meet and push up fold mountains; the Himalayas are the result of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates. Conservative, or transform, margins involve plates sliding past one another; movement is not smooth and stress builds up until it releases in earthquakes, with the San Andreas Fault being a well‑known example. Knowing which margin produces which landform helps you to explain distribution patterns of volcanoes, earthquakes and mountains.

## Rock types and their links to tectonic settings
Tectonic processes are closely linked to the formation and characteristics of rock types. Igneous rocks form when molten material cools and crystallises; basalt and granite are common igneous rocks, with basalt typically forming oceanic crust at constructive margins and granite forming deep continental intrusions. Sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone and limestone, form through the deposition and compaction of sediments and are often associated with former seabeds and river environments; they can later be uplifted by tectonic forces. Metamorphic rocks, like slate and marble, develop when existing rocks are transformed by heat and pressure, a process common in collision zones and areas of deep burial. Recognising these rock types and their origins helps you to link observable features—such as folded strata in mountains or volcanic rock exposures—to the plate processes that created them.

## Earthquakes: causes, measurement and effects
An earthquake is the sudden release of energy in the Earth’s crust that produces seismic waves. The point within the Earth where the rupture starts is the focus; the point on the surface vertically above it is the epicentre. Earthquakes are concentrated along plate boundaries where stress accumulates. The energy released is recorded by seismographs and historically reported on the Richter scale; more recently, the moment magnitude scale has been used for larger events because it gives a more accurate measure of total energy. Earthquakes cause a variety of primary and secondary physical effects. Ground shaking can collapse poorly constructed buildings, while ground rupture breaks the surface. Secondary effects include liquefaction, where water‑saturated soils temporarily behave like a liquid and cause buildings to tilt or sink, and tsunamis, which are powerful sea waves generated by undersea earthquakes that displace large volumes of water. The human impacts depend on factors such as population density, building standards and emergency planning. The 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in Japan illustrate how similar physical events can have very different outcomes. Haiti suffered hundreds of thousands of deaths and widespread devastation because of shallow focus, high population density and weak infrastructure, while Japan, though hit by a magnitude 9 earthquake and a devastating tsunami, had lower immediate mortality because of strict building codes, early warning systems and organised emergency response, even as it faced long‑term consequences such as nuclear contamination at Fukushima.

## Volcanoes: types, eruptions and wider impacts
Volcanoes arise where magma reaches the surface. The characteristics of volcanic eruptions depend on magma composition, temperature and gas content. Shield volcanoes, such as Mauna Loa, have gentle slopes and erupt low‑viscosity basaltic lava that can flow long distances, producing relatively gentle eruptions. Composite, or stratovolcanoes, like Mount St Helens or Mount Fuji, are built from alternating layers of lava and ash and produce more explosive eruptions because their magma is more viscous and gas‑rich. Supervolcanoes represent extremely large magma chambers that can produce eruptions far greater than ordinary volcanic events; a supereruption, such as that believed to have occurred at Yellowstone in the distant past, could send enormous volumes of ash into the atmosphere, disrupting climate, agriculture and global transport. Volcanic hazards include pyroclastic flows, ash fall that can collapse roofs and contaminate water supplies, lahars (volcanic mudflows) that destroy infrastructure, and long‑range climatic effects from ash and sulphur dioxide. While local impacts can be catastrophic, the wider environmental consequences—such as lowered temperatures from volcanic aerosols—show that volcanic events can have global significance.

## Predicting, preparing for and managing tectonic hazards
Although the timing and exact strength of earthquakes and eruptions are difficult to predict precisely, a range of measures can reduce risk and improve resilience. Monitoring technologies, including seismographs, GPS for detecting ground deformation, gas sensors for volcanic emissions and satellite observations, help scientists identify warning signs. Early warning systems can provide seconds to minutes of advance notice for earthquakes and can give longer warnings for tsunami following undersea events. Building design and regulation are vital, especially in densely populated or high‑risk regions. Earthquake‑resistant construction, retrofitting existing buildings, and enforcing strict building codes substantially reduce casualties. Land‑use planning can keep key facilities away from highest‑risk zones, while community education, regular drills and clear evacuation plans improve public response. In volcanic regions, designated exclusion zones, hazard mapping and continuous monitoring guide evacuations. Longer‑term strategies include insurance schemes, international aid arrangements and community recovery plans that address both immediate relief and sustainable rebuilding. The contrasts between MEDC and LEDC responses often reflect differences in resources and infrastructure: wealthier countries typically invest more in monitoring and resilient infrastructure, while poorer countries may need international support and low‑cost appropriate technologies to improve safety and recovery.

## Case studies and how to use them in answers
Case studies are central to GCSE geography because they let you apply knowledge to real places and events. When choosing an earthquake case study you should know whether you are focusing on an MEDC or an LEDC, identify the plates involved, and describe both the physical causes and the social and economic impacts. For example, a study of the 2010 Haiti earthquake should explain its shallow focus on a transform fault zone, the collapse of poorly designed buildings, the lack of emergency planning, and the prolonged humanitarian crisis that followed. A study of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake should describe the subduction zone off Japan’s east coast, the generation of a massive tsunami, the effectiveness of early warning systems and the subsequent long‑term recovery efforts. For volcanoes, compare a shield volcano such as Mauna Loa with a composite volcano such as Mount St Helens, and if relevant include a supervolcano scenario to discuss potential global effects. In your answers aim to combine factual description with analysis and evaluation: explain why impacts differed between places, assess the effectiveness of responses, and where asked evaluate management strategies against principles such as sustainability, considering environmental, economic and social factors.

## Exam technique
In the exam, read the question carefully and underline key words that tell you what to do: describe, explain, compare, evaluate and assess each require different approaches. When asked to describe, focus on clear factual statements; when asked to explain, use cause‑and‑effect chains that link processes to outcomes. For questions that require a case study, include specific place names, dates and concrete examples of impacts, responses and lessons learned. Always link your knowledge to the question’s context—for example, if the question concerns an MEDC, discuss building codes and early warning systems; for an LEDC consider limited resources and international aid. Use geographical terminology accurately—words such as epicentre, focus, subduction, pyroclastic flow and liquefaction demonstrate understanding. Where evaluation is required, weigh up positive and negative aspects and reach a reasoned judgement that refers back to the question and to sustainability where appropriate. In longer answers plan a clear structure: a short introduction, organised paragraphs each with a clear point and supporting evidence, and a concluding sentence that answers the question directly. Finally, practice past paper questions using your chosen case studies so you become confident at applying knowledge under timed conditions and at selecting the most relevant details to support your explanations and evaluations.
