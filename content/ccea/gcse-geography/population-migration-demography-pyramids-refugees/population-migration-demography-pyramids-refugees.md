# Population and migration: demography, pyramids & refugees (GCSE Geography Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Why population and migration matter
Population and migration are central to understanding how places change and how societies interact. Demography—the study of population size, structure and change—helps explain why cities grow, why some countries face labour shortages or high unemployment, and why governments plan for schools, hospitals and pensions. Migration changes the cultural, economic and political character of both sending and receiving places. At GCSE level you will be asked to explain processes such as natural change (births minus deaths), to interpret population pyramids, and to consider human stories behind migration, including the particular challenges faced by refugees. Thinking about these topics helps you connect human geography with real-world issues such as development, resources and sustainable planning.

## Measuring population change: birth rates, death rates and the Demographic Transition Model
Population change can be described simply as the balance between numbers of births and deaths, plus the effect of migration. Crude birth rate and crude death rate are basic measures expressed as the number of births or deaths per 1,000 people in a year. When births exceed deaths a country experiences natural increase; when deaths exceed births it experiences natural decrease. The Demographic Transition Model (DTM) offers a useful framework for understanding long-term changes in birth and death rates as countries develop. Stage 1 of the DTM describes high birth and death rates with a relatively stable population. In Stage 2 deaths fall rapidly because of improvements in health and sanitation while birth rates remain high, producing rapid population growth. Stage 3 sees birth rates begin to fall as education, urbanisation and access to contraception increase, slowing growth. Stage 4 is characterised by low birth and death rates and a more stable population, while Stage 5 (identified in some versions) suggests very low birth rates and an ageing population, possibly leading to population decline. The DTM is a model, so when you use it in answers make sure you explain its general patterns and also give real-world examples or limitations, such as the effect of migration or sudden changes caused by conflict or disease.

## Reading and using population pyramids
A population pyramid is a bar chart that shows the age and sex structure of a population. The shape of the pyramid gives immediate clues about birth rates, death rates and future needs. A broad base indicates many young people and suggests high birth rates and a likely continuing demand for schools and jobs; this is typical of many less economically developed countries (LEDCs). A narrower base with a wide top shows an ageing population with more older people than young, which is typical of some more economically developed countries (MEDCs). An ageing population increases the aged dependency ratio, meaning a larger proportion of retirees compared to the working-age population and greater pressure on pensions, healthcare and social care services. Conversely, a youthful population creates high youth dependency and strong demand for education, entry-level jobs and housing. When you are asked to compare pyramids in an exam, describe the shapes, explain the demographic reasons behind them and assess the social and economic implications for each country. You should be able to sketch a simple pyramid and annotate it to show how the working-age population supports dependents.

## Migration: push and pull factors, migrants and refugees, and barriers
People move for many reasons. Push factors drive people away from a place and include conflict, persecution, poverty, lack of jobs, poor services and environmental disasters. Pull factors attract people to a destination and include job opportunities, safety, better education and family connections. It is important to distinguish between economic migrants and refugees. Economic migrants move mainly for better livelihoods and are usually subject to immigration rules in destination countries. Refugees flee persecution or conflict and are protected under international asylum systems; their journeys are often dangerous and their legal status is different from that of voluntary migrants. Migration is rarely straightforward: human-made barriers such as visa controls, strict asylum procedures and border fences, and physical barriers such as mountains or seas, affect flows of people. In exam answers you will need to explain examples of push and pull factors and discuss barriers, showing how geography, policy and personal circumstances interact.

## Impacts of migration on origin and destination regions
Migration reshapes economies, societies and cultures in both sending and receiving areas. For origin countries, emigration can relieve unemployment and bring remittances—money sent home by migrants—that support families and local economies. However, a large outflow of skilled workers can cause brain drain and reduce the capacity of a country to develop services like healthcare and education. For destination countries, migrants can fill labour shortages, contribute taxes and bring cultural diversity. They may also create pressure on housing, schools and healthcare, and in some contexts tensions can arise over jobs and identity. The scale and speed of migration influence whether impacts are mainly positive or negative. In many GCSE answers you will be expected to balance these effects and to use case study detail. For example, migrant labour has been essential to the economies of some European countries, while sudden inflows of refugees can overwhelm local reception systems in neighbouring states.

## Refugees: humanitarian challenges and the response of destination countries
Refugees face unique challenges that extend beyond the decision to flee. Immediate needs often include shelter, food, medical care and protection from violence. Longer-term issues include legal status, access to education and work, mental health support and integration into new communities. Destination countries and nearby states must respond with emergency accommodations, asylum processing and policies for integration or resettlement. A useful case study to refer to is the movement of Syrian refugees that began in 2011, with many people fleeing to neighbouring countries and attempting to reach European shores. Some destination countries faced logistical, financial and political difficulties in managing arrivals, while others adopted different approaches—some prioritising humanitarian reception and resettlement, and others tightening borders. When you discuss refugees in exams, make sure to describe both the lived experience of refugees and the practical challenges for host countries, and to consider the role of international cooperation and organisations in coordinating aid and asylum decisions.

## Sources, methods and the role of data in studying population and migration
Good geography answers rely on data and examples. Census data, population registers and surveys provide the numerical foundation for calculating rates and producing population pyramids. The specification accepts census data as primary or secondary, depending on how it is collected and used. When you undertake fieldwork or classroom investigations you might use local population data, interviews, questionnaires or GIS to map migration flows and demographic patterns. Interpreting graphs and maps is a key skill: be prepared to explain trends shown on population pyramids, to draw conclusions from migration maps and to evaluate the reliability of different data sources. Always reflect on limitations: for instance, census data may be outdated between census years, and official migration statistics may miss irregular movement or short-term migrants. In an answer, noting these limitations strengthens your evaluation.

## Responses and policies: managing demographic change and migration sustainably
Countries use a range of policies to respond to demographic and migration challenges. To address ageing populations, some governments have encouraged higher birth rates through family-friendly policies, increased retirement ages, or encouraged targeted immigration to boost the workforce. In countries with youthful populations, investment in education, job creation and family planning can help convert a demographic “youth bulge” into an economic advantage. Migration policy varies from tight border control and strict visa systems to more open labour migration and humanitarian resettlement schemes. Sustainable responses recognise the need for long-term planning and international cooperation. For refugees, effective approaches combine immediate humanitarian assistance with durable solutions: voluntary return when safe, local integration in the host country, or resettlement to a third country. The United Nations’ sustainable development goals and international agreements encourage countries to manage migration and demographic change in ways that protect human rights and promote social and economic development. In exams, you should assess the strengths and weaknesses of different policies and make reasoned judgements about their likely success in particular contexts.

## Exam technique
Always begin by carefully reading the question and underlining command words such as “describe”, “explain”, “compare” or “evaluate”. For definition and short-answer parts, give clear, accurate meanings and, where appropriate, a brief example. When you are asked to describe patterns from a population pyramid or a graph, start with the overall shape and then support your description with specific features and what they indicate about birth rates, death rates and dependency. For explanation questions use cause–effect language and link physical, economic and social factors. In longer questions including case studies, introduce the case study briefly, use specific facts or figures where you can, and relate them directly to the question. When doing an evaluation or judgement, balance positive and negative impacts, acknowledge limitations of the evidence, and finish with a clear conclusion that answers the question. Practice sketching simplified population pyramids and labelling the key parts, and practise applying the Demographic Transition Model to named countries. For migration and refugee questions, make sure you distinguish between types of migrant and explain both individual motives and structural causes. Finally, manage your time in the exam so that you leave adequate space to plan, write and check extended answers, and always use the quality of written communication by organising your ideas clearly and using appropriate geographical terms.
