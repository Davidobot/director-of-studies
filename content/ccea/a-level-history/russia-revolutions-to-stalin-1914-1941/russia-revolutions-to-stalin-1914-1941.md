# Russia: Revolutions to Stalin (1914–1941) (A-level History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: the period and its significance
The years 1914–1941 cover the most dramatic transformation in modern Russian history: the end of the Romanov monarchy, two revolutions in 1917, a bitter Civil War, Bolshevik consolidation under Lenin, and the emergence of Stalin’s totalitarian state. This period is central to understanding twentieth‑century world politics because the Soviet Union became a major industrial and military power and an ideological model whose influence extended across Europe and beyond. For A‑level study, the emphasis is on causes, consequences, continuity and change: why the Tsarist regime collapsed; how and why the Bolsheviks seized and kept power; the nature and impact of Bolshevik economic measures in 1917–24; and the origins, aims and effects of Stalinism by 1941. These themes invite analysis of political leadership, social structure, economic pressures, war, ideology and the use of violence and coercion.

## Why the Tsarist regime collapsed in 1917
Long‑term weaknesses in the Russian state left it vulnerable to crisis. Autocratic rule under Nicholas II depended on an underdeveloped political system, limited industrialisation concentrated in a few cities, a huge peasant majority with insecure land tenancy, and an army whose loyalties were strained by defeat and poor supply. Short‑term catalysts included the strains of the First World War: catastrophic casualties, logistical failure, economic dislocation, inflation and a transport crisis that left cities hungry and demoralised. The February Revolution (March in the Gregorian calendar) of 1917 was precipitated by bread riots, mass demonstrations and the refusal of soldiers to fire on crowds. The Tsar’s abdication was the result of popular mobilization and elite desertion rather than a single conspiracy. In assessing causes, balance structural factors such as agrarian backwardness and the pressures of industrialisation with contingent events like military collapse and urban unrest; explain how cumulative stresses produced a sudden political rupture.

## The Revolutions of 1917: February and October
February 1917 replaced autocracy with a dual power arrangement: a Provisional Government drawn largely from liberal and moderate socialist elements, and soviets—workers’ and soldiers’ councils—dominated in many cities by socialist parties. The Provisional Government’s decision to continue the war, its difficulty in instituting effective land reform, and its inability to solve economic chaos undermined its legitimacy. Radicalisation accelerated through 1917 as Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, offered clear promises—"Peace, Land and Bread", and "All power to the Soviets"—that matched mass desires. The October Revolution was relatively bloodless in Petrograd but required careful organization: Bolshevik control of key cities, an active Red Guard, and exploitation of the Provisional Government’s weakness. In answering questions on 1917, distinguish between the distinctive character of the two revolutions: February as spontaneous mass upheaval and October as a party-led seizure exploiting popular discontent. Use specific events—Kornilov affair, return of Lenin in April, July Days, and the role of Trotsky as organizer—to show how the Bolsheviks moved from minority to power.

## Civil War and Bolshevik consolidation, 1918–24
After October, civil war and foreign intervention tested Bolshevik control. The Red Army, built and disciplined under Trotsky’s leadership, eventually defeated a disparate White movement and numerous regional, national and peasant uprisings. The war shaped policy: War Communism (1918–21) nationalised industry, requisitioned grain and used strict labour controls to supply the Red Army and urban centres. These measures achieved military victory but provoked economic collapse, famine and popular disaffection. The Kronstadt mutiny and peasant revolts made Lenin and Bolshevik leaders reconsider policy, leading to the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, which restored some market mechanisms and small‑scale private trade to stabilise the economy. When assessing consolidation, weigh the effectiveness of coercion and central control against pragmatic concessions like the NEP. Consider continuity and change: the Bolsheviks retained a monopoly of political power while temporarily reversing the more extreme economic controls.

## Lenin’s aims and policies, 1917–24: achievements and limits
Lenin’s principal aims were to secure and preserve revolutionary power, to transform an agrarian economy, and to defend the new state against internal and external enemies. Early Bolshevik decrees abolished private landownership, nationalised banks and industry, and declared rights for national minorities. War Communism reflected the imperative of survival but produced humanitarian catastrophe and economic breakdown. The NEP represented a tactical retreat to revive production and rebuild the economy, and it helped stabilise urban supplies and restore some agricultural incentives. Politically, the Bolsheviks suppressed rival parties and civil liberties in the name of defending the revolution: the Cheka and extraordinary tribunals became instruments of political repression. When writing on Lenin’s era, assess both ideological commitments and practical compromises, and explain how choices made in civil war shaped administrative centralisation and the party’s dominance—features crucial to understanding the later emergence of Stalinism.

## Stalin’s rise to power and the nature of his dictatorship, 1924–41
Stalin’s emergence as Lenin’s successor was not predetermined. He accumulated power largely through bureaucratic and organisational control as General Secretary, by building alliances within the Communist Party, and by presenting himself as Lenin’s political heir. He outmaneuvered rivals—most notably Trotsky, who combined theoretical brilliance with military prestige—by exploiting party mechanisms, isolating opponents, and winning support among those who feared Trotsky’s radicalism or resented him. Once secured by 1929, Stalin launched policies that transformed Soviet society. The first Five‑Year Plans prioritized rapid industrialisation, heavy industry and state planning through Gosplan. Collectivisation of agriculture aimed to consolidate state control over the countryside, raise grain procurement and free labour for industry, but it caused widespread resistance, mass deportations, and famines, most brutally in Ukraine during 1932–33. Politically, the 1930s saw the growth of a highly repressive regime: show trials, purges of the party and military (notably 1936–38), widespread use of the Gulag system and the construction of a pervasive cult of personality around Stalin. By 1941 the USSR had been transformed into a centrally planned, industrialised and heavily policed state that could mobilise resources for modern warfare, but at a tremendous human cost. In essays, analyse both the objectives (security, modernisation, ideological conformity) and the methods (bureaucratic centralisation, terror, propaganda) of Stalinism.

## Interpreting the period: approaches and historiographical debates
Historians debate continuities and ruptures between Bolshevism under Lenin and Stalinism. One view stresses continuity: centralised party rule, suppression of opposition and use of coercion were present from 1918 and simply intensified. Another emphasizes rupture: Stalinism represented a new model—bureaucratic, personalist and unanticipated by Bolshevik ideology—with industrialisation and mass terror becoming dominant. Debates also concern the inevitability of revolution: structural explanations point to the strains of war, agrarian backwardness and social inequality, while agency‑centered approaches highlight leadership choices and the role of the Bolshevik Party. When preparing answers, engage with these interpretations: show awareness of differing viewpoints, use evidence to support a position, and explain why one interpretation may be more convincing for a particular question. Use examples such as the NEP as evidence of pragmatic flexibility and the Great Purge as evidence of the systemic use of terror to maintain power.

## Exam technique
Begin every answer with a brief focused introduction that defines terms, sets the chronological frame and outlines the argument you will make. For essay questions, ensure your response addresses the question directly throughout: each paragraph should develop a clear point linked back to the question and supported by specific evidence, dates and individuals. For source‑based questions, treat provenance as part of context: who produced the source, for what audience and purpose, and how does that affect reliability and perspective? Compare sources by assessing both content and origin, and use your own knowledge to corroborate or challenge source claims. When evaluating interpretations, identify the historian’s argument, explain the evidence they use, assess strengths and weaknesses, and reach a balanced judgement. Time management is crucial: in a 1 hour 30 minute paper that requires a short response and an extended essay, spend proportionately more time on the extended essay but allow time to plan and proofread. Always conclude with a clear summative judgement that addresses the question’s demand (for example, extent, significance or causation). Integrate AO1 knowledge, AO2 source analysis and AO3 engagement with interpretations as required by the specification: make connections across the period, demonstrate range and depth of knowledge, and show critical awareness of how the past has been interpreted. Practise past questions under timed conditions and use structured plans to ensure arguments are coherent, well evidenced and directly responsive to the question set.
