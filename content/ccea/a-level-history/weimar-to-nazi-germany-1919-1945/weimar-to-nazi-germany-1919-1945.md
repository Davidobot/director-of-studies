# Weimar Republic to Nazi Germany (1919–1945) (A-level History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Introduction: from Empire to Republic
The story of Germany between 1919 and 1945 is one of fragile democratic experiment, economic and political crisis, radicalisation and totalitarian rule. The Weimar Republic emerged from the collapse of the German Empire at the end of the First World War. Faced with the political shock of defeat, a punitive peace settlement, social unrest and competing claims to legitimacy, Germany’s new constitution created a modern parliamentary democracy with proportional representation and a powerful presidency. Those institutional arrangements were intended to combine democratic legitimacy with stability, yet they also contained fault lines which opponents could exploit. The immediate post-war years were marked by political violence from left and right, the attempted Communist uprisings in 1919 and the right-wing Kapp Putsch in 1920, while the Treaty of Versailles created deep resentments that undermined the Republic’s early authority.

## Crisis and recovery, 1919–1929
The early Weimar years were dominated by extreme economic turbulence and political instability. Hyperinflation in 1923 shattered savings and social confidence after reparations payments and wartime expenditure destabilised the currency, and the French occupation of the Ruhr that year heightened nationalist grievance. Yet from late 1923 a degree of stabilisation set in. The government of Gustav Stresemann introduced the Rentenmark and pursued pragmatic foreign policy initiatives that gradually rehabilitated Germany on the international stage. The Dawes Plan of 1924 eased reparations payments and encouraged American loans, while the Locarno Treaties and Germany’s entry to the League of Nations in 1926 helped create the impression of a “sane” Germany returning to normal. Economically the mid-to-late 1920s are often labelled the “Golden Years” for urban culture, social reforms and industrial recovery, though agriculture lagged and many Germans remained insecure. Politically, the period saw coalition governments struggling under proportional representation and the persistent presence of anti-democratic forces on the extremes of the left and right.

## Collapse of Weimar and the Nazi seizure of power, 1929–1933
The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing global depression exposed the Republic’s vulnerabilities. American loans were recalled, German exports collapsed and unemployment soared. Democratically-formed coalition governments found it increasingly difficult to govern by parliamentary majority; instead, chancellors made increasing use of presidential emergency powers under Article 48. The conservative chancellor Heinrich Brüning’s austerity policies deepened social distress and eroded support for moderate parties, while the Nazi Party, with its disciplined organisation, modern propaganda and mass rallies, converted economic despair into votes. Between 1928 and 1932 the Nazis rose from a marginal party to the largest party in the Reichstag, though without an outright majority. A series of short-lived chancellorships in 1932–33, backroom deals among conservative elites and the belief that Hitler could be controlled from within a coalition brought him to the chancellorship on 30 January 1933. What followed in the next months — the Reichstag Fire in February, the Reichstag Fire Decree suspending civil liberties and the Enabling Act of March 1933 giving Hitler legislative powers — transformed a legal appointment into a dictatorship. By the summer of 1933 most political parties had been banned, independent trade unions dissolved and state institutions rapidly “co-ordinated” (Gleichschaltung) to align with Nazi objectives.

## Consolidation of the Nazi state, 1933–1939
Once in power, the Nazis combined legal measures, terror and mass mobilisation to consolidate control. The elimination of rivals culminated in the Night of the Long Knives in June 1934, when the SA leadership and other opponents were purged, strengthening Hitler’s hold over the army and conservative elites. The death of President Hindenburg later that year allowed Hitler to merge the chancellorship and presidency into the office of Führer, cementing a personalised dictatorship. The regime transformed state structures through centrally-directed ministries, party networks and loyal officials operating under the Führerprinzip, which emphasised unquestioning obedience. Economic policy mixed rearmament and public works with authoritarian control of labour; the Four Year Plan, launched in 1936 under Göring, prioritised rearmament and autarky. In domestic life the Nazis promoted the Volksgemeinschaft ideal, enforcing social conformity through propaganda, youth organisations and restrictive laws, while persecuting Jews, political opponents and other minorities. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws institutionalised racial antisemitism by stripping Jews of citizenship and codifying exclusion. Foreign policy moved from revisionist diplomacy to aggressive territorial expansion: remilitarisation of the Rhineland (1936), intervention in the Spanish Civil War, Anschluss with Austria (1938) and the Munich settlement over the Sudetenland (1938) all revealed the regime’s readiness to flout Versailles and test Western responses. Kristallnacht in November 1938 signalled the transition from discrimination to organised violent persecution of Jews on a large scale.

## Nazi policy in power: ideology, society and economy
Nazi governance blended ideological aims and pragmatic choices. Racial ideology and the quest for living space (Lebensraum) shaped both domestic measures and imperial ambitions, but practical economic and diplomatic calculations also influenced policy. The regime sought to mobilise mass loyalty through spectacle, education and media; propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels orchestrated a saturated propaganda environment, while cultural institutions were purged of “degenerate” art and replaced with a heroic aesthetic. Social policies promoted traditional gender roles for women and a selective welfare provision designed to reward “racially desirable” families, yet the regime also controlled social life through surveillance, the Gestapo and local party officials. Economically, early recovery rested on state spending and rearmament, which reduced unemployment but created structural distortions and an economy increasingly oriented to war. Coercive labour practices, forced labour from occupied territories and the exploitation of Jews and persecuted groups became central as the regime transformed into a war economy.

## War, genocide and collapse, 1939–1945
The invasion of Poland in September 1939 initiated the Second World War and unleashed policies of conquest and racial terror on a scale unprecedented in modern Europe. Occupied territories were governed through combinations of direct German rule, collaborationist regimes and brutal repression. On the Eastern Front, ideological warfare merged with economic exploitation: Generalplan Ost envisaged the depopulation and colonisation of vast areas, while Einsatzgruppen carried out mass shootings of Jews and others in the wake of advancing armies. From 1941 the systemic extermination of European Jews was increasingly bureaucratised and industrialised, culminating in death camps and the Final Solution, decided and coordinated at meetings such as Wannsee in 1942. The Holocaust resulted in the murder of approximately six million Jews alongside the mass killing of Roma, disabled people, political prisoners and others. As the war turned against Germany from 1942–43, the regime intensified repression and mobilised society for total war. Allied strategic bombing devastated German cities, shortages and casualties undermined morale, and resistance remained limited though notable in pockets such as the White Rose, the Kreisau Circle and the July 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler. Germany’s unconditional surrender in May 1945 left the country devastated and paved the way for Allied occupation, denazification and post-war trials of Nazi leaders.

## Interpretations and historiographical debates
Historians disagree about the relative importance of long-term structures, contingency and individuals in explaining Nazi ascent and the unfolding of genocide. Some emphasize the structural weaknesses of Weimar — its unstable party system, economic dependence on foreign loans and the traumatic legacy of Versailles — as the context that made authoritarian alternatives attractive. Others stress contingent events: the economic collapse after 1929, the miscalculations of conservative elites and crises of legitimacy that provided opportunities Hitler exploited. Debates about the Holocaust have often been framed as intentionalist versus structuralist. Intentionalists argue for a coherent, top-down plan driven by Hitler’s ideological commitment to genocide from the earliest days, while structuralists emphasise a more cumulative radicalisation in which competing agencies, wartime conditions and local initiatives produced increasingly radical outcomes. Recent scholarship tends to integrate these positions, recognising Hitler’s central role and genocidal intent while also acknowledging the bureaucracy, constraints and situational dynamics that shaped policy implementation. Understanding these debates helps students evaluate sources and interpretations in examination answers and to make balanced, evidence-based judgements.

## Exam technique
Approach questions with a clear understanding of the assessment objectives. For essays (AO1) establish a focused thesis and organise your answer thematically and chronologically where appropriate; support arguments with precise factual examples, including dates, legislation and names, and evaluate significance rather than narrate alone. For source-based questions (AO2), pay attention to both content and provenance: say what each source literally asserts, explain how its origin, purpose and audience affect its reliability, and cross-reference with your own knowledge to assess utility and limitations. When analysing interpretations (AO3), compare interpretations by considering the evidence each uses, the historian’s perspective or context, and whether one explanation better accounts for the full range of facts. In practice, address counter-arguments and weigh different explanations before reaching a judgement. Time management is crucial: plan answers briefly, allocate time according to mark weightings and leave a few minutes for a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Use precise terminology—words such as Gleichschaltung, Enabling Act, Volksgemeinschaft, Lebensraum, Reichstag Fire and Wannsee are useful signposts—and make synoptic links where required, for example connecting Weimar institutional weaknesses to the rise of Hitler or wartime exigencies to radicalisation of persecution. Above all, demonstrate critical engagement: show knowledge, interrogate sources and interpretations, and reach well-reasoned conclusions grounded in evidence.
