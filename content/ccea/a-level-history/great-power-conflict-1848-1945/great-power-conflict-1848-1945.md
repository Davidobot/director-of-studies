# Great Power Conflict: Causes & Consequences (1848–1945) (A-level History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Introduction: a century of mounting tension
The period 1848–1945 describes a long, uneven process in which European politics shifted from contested liberal-national revolutions to catastrophic global wars and a transformed world order. Key themes for this A2 option are how the ambitions of states and leaders, the growth of nationalism, economic competition, and the formation of rival alliances turned Europe from an uneasy balance of power into a tinderbox; and how the First World War, its settlement and the interwar crises produced the conditions for an even more destructive Second World War. Throughout this narrative it is important to think in terms of both long-term structural developments — the legacy of 19th‑century unification and imperialism — and short-term triggers such as crises in the Balkans or decisions by individual leaders.

## German unification, 1848–1890: the disrupted balance of power
The revolutions of 1848 exposed the tensions between older multi‑national empires and emergent national movements but failed to create a liberal Europe. Instead, the decisive political change of the later nineteenth century was German unification. The collapse of 1848‑revolutionary hopes left a legacy in which conservative nation‑building under state actors overtook liberal reform. Prussia’s ascendancy, first under Bismarck through wars with Denmark, Austria and France and then in the creation of the German Empire in 1871, reshaped the balance of power. A united Germany sat at the heart of Europe as a powerful, industrialised state with large population, economic dynamism and an assertive policy. Bismarck’s diplomacy sought to stabilise this new order through a system of alliances and careful management of France; yet unification also generated French revanchism and a persistent sense that German power was a threat. Students should see unification both as an achievement of statecraft and as a destabilising structural shift that made nineteenth‑century diplomacy more brittle.

## The Eastern Question and Balkan nationalism
While great power rivalry was reshaped in the west and centre of Europe, the Ottoman Empire’s decline produced another source of instability: the Eastern Question. The Balkans became a crucible of competing nationalisms — Serbian, Bulgarian, Greek and others — whose aspirations collided with Austro‑Hungarian and Russian interests. The two Balkan Wars of 1912–13 and the Bosnian annexation crisis of 1908 are illustrative: local struggles for territory and national self‑determination repeatedly threatened to draw the Great Powers into conflict. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 therefore must be seen as the immediate trigger of a much larger process: by 1914 the Balkans were where imperial rivalry, nationalist fervour and alliance commitments combined to make local incidents escalate into continental war.

## Causes of the First World War, 1890–1914: structures and triggers
Explaining the outbreak of 1914 demands attention to multiple, interacting causes. The period after 1890 saw shifts in German policy with Kaiser Wilhelm II’s dismissal of Bismarck and the adoption of Weltpolitik; this produced a more assertive, naval‑building Germany and heightened British worries. Imperialism and economic competition drove rival ambitions overseas, while a pervasive militarism and belief in the efficacy of military solutions made mobilisation plans politically credible. The alliance system — the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance — created a situation where a conflict between two states could attract their partners. Naval rivalry and the Anglo‑German arms race, the Franco‑German enmity over Alsace‑Lorraine, and the role of domestic politics (elite and popular pressures) all contributed. The July 1914 crisis shows how contingency and miscalculation mattered: mobilisation timetables, diplomatic failures, and the momentum of military plans pushed European governments toward war even where alternatives existed.

## The First World War and its immediate consequences, 1914–1918
The First World War was unprecedented in scale and destructiveness. Industrialised warfare, total mobilisation, and the collapse of four imperial dynasties — German, Austro‑Hungarian, Russian and Ottoman — transformed European societies. The human cost, economic dislocation, and social upheaval fed political radicalism, revolution and profound disillusionment with pre‑war institutions. When the fighting ended, the peace settlement attempted to redraw boundaries and punish the defeated, above all Germany. The Treaty of Versailles imposed territorial losses, military restrictions and reparations, and contained the controversial Article 231 (the “war guilt” clause). While intended to secure stability and justice, the treaty had contradictions: it created new states and promised self‑determination in some areas while entrenching imperial rule in others, and its punitive terms, combined with economic turmoil, helped produce political extremism.

## The interwar years: the Versailles settlement, economic crisis and the rise of authoritarianism
The 1920s and 1930s were an era of uneasy recovery and recurring crisis. The immediate post‑war instability produced revolutions (notably in Russia), civil wars, and shifts in borders; the 1920s saw attempts to stabilise with the League of Nations, the Locarno treaties and economic measures such as the Dawes Plan. Yet the Great Depression of 1929 exposed the fragility of international economic interdependence, produced mass unemployment and intensified political polarisation. Fascist and authoritarian movements in Italy, Germany and elsewhere exploited economic despair, nationalist resentments and fears of communism. In Germany, the factors that followed Versailles — humiliating terms, hyperinflation in 1923, unresolved grievances and the failure of moderate politics — fed the appeal of Hitler’s radical, revisionist programme. Students should track how structural economic shocks interacted with political culture and institutional weaknesses to discredit liberal democracy in significant states.

## From appeasement to global war, 1933–1939: policy, miscalculation and escalation
The 1930s are often studied through the lens of appeasement and the failure of collective security. Hitler’s early moves — withdrawal from the League, rearmament, remilitarisation of the Rhineland, and Anschluss with Austria — tested the resolve of Britain and France. Appeasement, epitomised by Munich in 1938, reflected a mixture of motives: trauma from 1914–18, widespread pacifist sentiment, economic weakness, inadequate armaments, and the belief that limited concessions could satisfy revisionist demands and preserve peace. Critically, appeasement also underestimated Hitler’s aims and misread the balance of power. The Nazi‑Soviet Pact of August 1939 removed the risk of a two‑front war for Germany and cleared the way for the invasion of Poland; Britain and France’s guarantees to Poland meant that the assault in September 1939 precipitated the Second World War. Students should assess the extent to which appeasement was a reasonable policy given constraints, versus a strategic error that emboldened aggression.

## Consequences of the Second World War, 1939–1945: geopolitical realignment and human catastrophe
The Second World War far exceeded the First in scale and consequence. It produced unparalleled civilian suffering — including the Holocaust and massive population displacements — and saw the use of nuclear weapons in 1945. Politically, the war ended the dominance of imperial Europe. Instead, two superpowers emerged: the United States and the Soviet Union. Europe was economically devastated and politically divided, foreshadowing the Cold War and the division of Germany. The United Nations was founded to replace the League and to provide a framework for collective security and international cooperation, while Bretton Woods laid the foundations for post‑war economic institutions. Decolonisation accelerated as European powers could no longer sustain global empires, and welfare state policies in many countries reflected a desire to rebuild more equitable societies. For students, the key is to see the war as both the catastrophic endpoint of earlier dynamics and the starting point of a radically different international order.

## Interpreting causes and consequences: approaches for analysis
When analysing Great Power conflict across this period, it is valuable to adopt a multi‑causal approach that distinguishes long‑term structures, medium‑term developments and immediate triggers. Structural factors include the transformation of the European state system after German unification and the centrifugal forces unleashed by nationalism and imperial competition. Medium‑term factors encompass alliance networks, economic rivalry and the politicisation of mass publics; immediate triggers are the specific crises, mobilisations and decisions that converted tensions into war. In evaluating consequences, students should balance political and diplomatic outcomes with social, economic and cultural change: treaties and borders matter, but so do population losses, ideological shifts and institutional legacies such as the United Nations or welfare reforms. Comparing the two world wars is also illuminating: the First discredited nineteenth‑century liberal internationalism and reshaped borders; the Second destroyed empires, created superpowers and ushered in decolonisation and the Cold War.

## Exam technique
Answering synoptic essay questions on causes and consequences requires clarity, balance and use of specific evidence. Begin by interpreting the question precisely and setting out a clear thesis that addresses causation or consequence directly. Structure your response in coherent paragraphs, each focused on a single factor or theme and linking it back to the question. Use precise examples — for instance, treaties, dates of key events (German unification 1871, Bosnian annexation 1908, assassination 1914, Versailles 1919, Munich 1938) and named policies (Weltpolitik, the Schlieffen Plan, the Dawes Plan) — to substantiate claims. Weigh relative importance: explain why some causes were structural and long‑running while others acted as catalysts, and where appropriate, acknowledge counter‑arguments or limitations in sources. For synoptic questions, make explicit connections across the period, showing continuity and change; this demonstrates the higher‑order skills examiners reward. Time management is crucial: plan your essay briefly, leave time for a concluding paragraph that synthesises your argument, and, where source‑based tasks are set, integrate source evaluation by considering provenance, tone and context alongside your factual knowledge. Practise writing full answers under timed conditions, aiming to combine narrative clarity with analytical judgement and well‑chosen evidence.
