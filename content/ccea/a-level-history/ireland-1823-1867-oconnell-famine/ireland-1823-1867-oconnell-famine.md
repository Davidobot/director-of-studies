# Ireland 1823–1867: O'Connell and the Famine (A-level History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Introduction: scope and significance
The period 1823–1867 is pivotal for understanding modern Ireland. It spans Daniel O’Connell’s mobilisation of mass Catholic politics, the catastrophic Great Famine and the profound social, economic and political aftershocks that followed. Students should see this era as one in which tactics of political mobilisation, expectations of state responsibility and the nature of Irish nationalism were all put under severe strain. O’Connell’s achievement in securing Catholic Emancipation in 1829 showed the power of constitutional mass politics, while the failure of repeal, the grinding experience of famine and the subsequent rise of more radical national movements together shaped Ireland’s path towards the later nineteenth‑century land question and physical‑force nationalism exemplified by the Fenian movement.

## O’Connell and Catholic Emancipation, 1823–1834
Daniel O’Connell emerged from the 1820s as the dominant figure of Irish constitutional nationalism. In 1823 he founded the Catholic Association to unify and mobilise the Catholic population, combining subscription fundraising, vigorous public campaigning and the tactical readiness to contest elections. The Association’s success rested on its organisational innovation: a broad base of support that cut across class lines and used electoral pressure to force the issue on Westminster. The decisive moment came in the 1828 County Clare election, when O’Connell, though legally barred from taking a seat as a Catholic, stood and won with overwhelming popular support. Faced with the prospect of unrest and of a Catholic MP unable to sit, the British government passed the Roman Catholic Relief Act in 1829, marking a major constitutional concession. Emancipation removed many of the formal barriers to Catholic participation, but it was not a social panacea. The Act raised the property qualification for MPs, which had the unintended effect of narrowing parliamentary representation and sidelining some lower‑status Catholic aspirants. Nonetheless, O’Connell’s success established mass mobilisation by peaceful, legal means—what he called “moral force”—as a central strand of Irish politics.

## Repeal: mobilisation, limits and failure, 1835–47
After Emancipation O’Connell turned to the next great objective: repeal of the Act of Union and restoration of an Irish parliament. From the mid‑1830s he organised the Repeal Association and revived public meetings on a massive scale. The so‑called “monster meetings” of 1843 attracted tens of thousands and expressed the depth of popular support for repeal. Yet the movement revealed inherent tensions. O’Connell’s insistence on non‑violence limited his ability to coerce Westminster but also avoided providing a clear alternative mechanism for achieving constitutional change. The British government’s increasing nervousness culminated in the suppression of the planned Clontarf meeting in October 1843; O’Connell complied with the ban, effectively accepting a constraint that damaged the movement’s momentum. Subsequent legal pressures—his arrest and conviction for conspiracy in 1844, later overturned on appeal—further exacerbated the movement’s decline. The outbreak of famine from 1845 and O’Connell’s death in 1847 removed its most charismatic organiser. Moreover, the social and economic crisis exposed the limits of appeals to constitutional reform alone when ordinary people’s survival was at stake.

## The causes of the Great Famine: structural and immediate factors
Understanding the Famine requires attention to deep structural features as well as the immediate biological cause. For generations before 1845 Ireland’s rural economy had become heavily reliant on the potato for subsistence, especially among the rural poor and cottier tenants who occupied very small holdings. Population pressure, a pattern of small‑scale tillage and a system of land tenure dominated by landlords—many absentees—created vulnerabilities. The introduction of potato blight (Phytophthora infestans) in 1845 and its recurrence in subsequent years was the proximate trigger: successive harvest failures destroyed the staple on which a large proportion of the population depended. Yet the impact of blight was intensified by social and economic arrangements: export of grain continued from Ireland during the famine years, reflecting commercial agriculture and market ties; the inadequacy of rural poverty relief; and the limited capacity of a laissez‑faire British policy to respond to such a humanitarian crisis. These interacting elements explain why a plant disease translated into mass starvation and mortality.

## The course of the Famine and relief measures, 1845–1852
The Famine unfolded in phases. The initial failure of the 1845 potato crop produced acute hardship in 1846, worsened by a second bad year in 1847, the “Black ’47”, which saw mortality at its highest. Relief efforts were a mixture of private charity, local measures and British government intervention, the latter constrained by prevailing economic ideas and administrative structures. The Irish Poor Law (1838) and the system of workhouses proved inadequate: workhouses were soon overwhelmed, while the insistence on workhouse relief as the main state option excluded many and carried social stigma. Early in the crisis Sir Robert Peel’s Tory government took some emergency measures, most famously the importation of Indian maize, but Peel’s fall and the coming of the Whig government of Lord John Russell coincided with a policy preference for limited, temporary relief and for using public works rather than direct largescale provisioning. The public works schemes, administered by the Board of Works, were often badly designed and underfunded; they were too late for many. Soup kitchens — introduced on a larger scale in 1847 — saved lives in the short term but were not a long‑term solution. Evictions by landlords, whether harsh or paternalistic, accelerated dispossession; while some landlords provided relief, many others prioritized rents and market transactions or sold lands. The combined effect was mass mortality, estimated at around one million deaths, and mass migration—emigration to Britain, North America and elsewhere that reduced the population by a further significant number over the following decades.

## Political and social consequences up to 1867
The Famine reshaped Irish society and politics. Demographically it reduced population dramatically and permanently altered settlement patterns, accelerating the decline of smallholdings and prompting a shift towards larger, more pastoral farms in many districts. Socially and culturally the devastation eroded the fabric of rural communities, weakened the Irish language in many areas and left a legacy of trauma and memory that coloured subsequent politics. Politically, the Famine deepened distrust of British governance for many Irish people. While constitutional nationalism continued, the period also saw the rise of movements prepared to contemplate force. Young Ireland, a group of more radical nationalists who broke with O’Connell in the 1840s, attempted an insurrection in 1848 which failed—partly because of poor preparation, limited support and the scale of repression—but their efforts marked a clear shift among some from moral force to the consideration of physical force. The Irish Republican Brotherhood, founded in the late 1850s, and the Fenian Rising of 1867, which was quickly suppressed, represent the further radicalisation of a strand of Irish nationalism shaped in part by the memory of the Famine and by continuing grievances over land and tenancy. The land question itself grew in importance: secure tenure, fair rents and fixity of tenure would dominate Irish politics later in the century as responses to the patterns of eviction and insecurity exposed by the famine years.

## Interpretations and historical debate
Historians have long debated responsibility and causation for the Famine’s scale. One central axis of interpretation contrasts structural explanations—landlordism, demographic pressure, tenure insecurity and the vulnerabilities of monoculture—with explanations that emphasize policy failure at Westminster: critics argue that the British government’s commitment to laissez‑faire economics, its delayed and inadequate relief measures and its failure to intervene decisively converted a crop failure into a humanitarian catastrophe. Others point out administrative complexities, fiscal constraints and ideological context to explain government choices, arguing for a degree of contingency rather than deliberate malice. There have also been contested claims about whether the famine constituted a form of genocide; this remains a controversial and politically charged argument. What is widely agreed is that the famine transformed Irish society and politics, undermined confidence in the Union for many, and that its memory would be a powerful force in subsequent nationalist and agrarian movements.

## Legacy: from O’Connell’s constitutionalism to the rise of physical‑force nationalism
O’Connell’s model of constitutional, mass‑mobilised, non‑violent politics left an enduring imprint. It showed that popular pressure could produce legislative change, but the Famine exposed its limits when confronted with socio‑economic catastrophe. In the longer term, the period up to 1867 saw a diversification of nationalist strategy: while constitutionalism remained alive in various forms, including the later Home Rule movement, the rise of the Fenians and the persistence of revolutionary republican ideas demonstrated that many Irishmen and women had lost faith in gradualist approaches. The land question became central to later politics because the Famine had made tenure insecurity and landlord power central to Irish grievances. By 1867 the pattern was of a country changed irreversibly in population, economy, and political temper: O’Connell’s legacy remained, but it now coexisted with a much more fractious and radicalised political landscape.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Ireland 1823–1867, be clear about the time frame and the command words. For AO1 essays you should define the question, set the argument in the opening paragraph and use chronological detail and specific examples to support analytical points: refer to the Catholic Association (1823), the Clare election (1828), the Roman Catholic Relief Act (1829), the Repeal Association and the monster meetings of 1843, the arrival of the blight in 1845 and the peak crisis of Black ’47, and the Fenian Rising of 1867. For source‑based AO2 questions, place documents in context: consider author/publisher, purpose, intended audience and tone, and weigh what the source reveals against what it omits. For AO3 interpretation questions, compare differing historians’ views where relevant, evaluate the evidence for each interpretation and conclude by judging which explanation is most convincing in the light of the available evidence. Always link back to the question throughout your answer and end with a concise conclusion that expresses the overall judgement. Time management is crucial: allocate time proportional to marks, plan briefly before writing, and ensure that essays have a clear logical structure with substantiated argument rather than narrative alone.
