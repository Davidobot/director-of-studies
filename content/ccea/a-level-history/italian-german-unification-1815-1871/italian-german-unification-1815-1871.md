# Italian and German Unification (1815–1871) (A-level History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Overview: Europe after 1815 and the impulse to unify
The period between the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871 was one of dramatic change across Europe. The conservative settlement of 1815 restored dynastic states and sought to suppress revolutionary nationalism, yet the forces that had been unleashed by the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars—national identity, liberal political ideas and economic modernisation—continued to grow. In both Italy and Germany the map in 1815 was fragmented: Italy consisted of multiple states including the Kingdom of Sardinia (Piedmont), the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Papal States and Lombardy–Venetia under Austrian control, while the German lands numbered dozens of principalities loosely organised under the German Confederation dominated by Austria. Over the next half-century both regions experienced failed liberal-national uprisings, elite manoeuvring and wars that transformed fragmentation into national states. Understanding unification requires attention to the interaction between ideas, social change, economic integration, individual agency and international diplomacy.

## Intellectual and social foundations: nationalism, liberalism and economic change
Nationalism and liberalism supplied the language and aspirations that made unification thinkable. Cultural nationalism, expressed through literature, language standardisation and political societies, created a sense of a shared past and destiny. Liberalism provided the model of constitutional government and civil rights that many Italian and German middle-class activists sought. Yet social realities mattered: the industrialising north of Italy and the economically dynamic Prussia had different capacities to lead unification than more agrarian regions. The Zollverein, the Prussian-led customs union established in the 1830s and 1840s, illustrates how economic integration preceded political consolidation in Germany, knitting markets and interests together. Conversely, southern Italy remained economically backward, which helps explain the different character of Italian unification and the persistence of regional disparity. The revolutions of 1848 demonstrated both the spread of national and liberal ideas and their limits: popular uprisings often lacked coordination and elite support, and conservative military power could defeat them. These failures shaped subsequent tactics, steering many leaders to favour cautious diplomacy, state-building from above, or a mixture of popular action and elite orchestration.

## The unification of Italy: failures, Piedmontese leadership and the Risorgimento
Italian unification—or the Risorgimento—was a complex process combining popular movements with statecraft. The revolutionary mood of 1848 produced uprisings across the peninsula but these were suppressed, demonstrating the fragility of purely popular attempts. The decisive actor became the Kingdom of Sardinia–Piedmont under Victor Emmanuel II and his astute prime minister, Count Camillo di Cavour. Cavour pursued a policy of constitutional modernisation, economic reform and diplomatic alliances designed to expand Piedmont’s influence. He engineered French support for war with Austria through the secret Plombières agreement with Napoleon III in 1858; the subsequent Second Italian War of Independence (1859) resulted in Austrian losses in Lombardy after battles such as Magenta and Solferino, although Napoleon’s diplomatic withdrawal left questions unresolved. Meanwhile, Giuseppe Garibaldi, the charismatic republican and military leader, launched the spectacular Expedition of the Thousand in 1860, conquering the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and winning popular support in the south. Cavour and Piedmontese elites skilfully absorbed these gains, balancing nationalist sentiment with the creation of a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic. The new Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in 1861, but important territories remained outside: Venetia remained under Austrian control until 1866 when Italy allied with Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War and was awarded Venetia. Rome, governed by the Pope and protected by a French garrison, was finally annexed in 1870 after French troops were withdrawn during the Franco-Prussian War; Rome became the capital shortly thereafter. The Italian path combined military conflict, diplomacy and popular mobilisation, but it was marked by compromises—particularly between monarchical and republican aspirations—and by ongoing regional divisions.

## The unification of Germany: Prussia, Bismarck and the role of force
German unification followed a different trajectory, dominated by Prussia and the realpolitik of Otto von Bismarck. The failed 1848 revolutions revealed both the appeal of national unity and the strength of conservative elites. Prussia, under a modernising bureaucracy and a powerful military, emerged as the natural leader of unification. Bismarck, appointed Minister-President in 1862, rejected sentimental nationalism and instead pursued pragmatic policies to strengthen Prussia’s position. He used a calculated sequence of wars to sideline rivals and create political facts. In 1864 Prussia, allied with Austria, fought Denmark and gained Schleswig and Holstein; disputes over administration then provided pretext for Bismarck to provoke the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. Prussia’s decisive victory at Königgrätz effectively excluded Austria from German affairs and led to the formation of the North German Confederation under Prussian leadership. Bismarck then engineered the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, using diplomatic manipulation of the Ems Dispatch to provoke French hostility. The stunning Prussian-led victory over France produced a wave of southern German states joining the North German Confederation and culminated in the proclamation of the German Empire in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles on 18 January 1871, with King Wilhelm I of Prussia crowned Emperor. German unification was therefore largely "top-down," imposed by a powerful state through military strength, skillful diplomacy and careful alliance-building, although nationalist enthusiasm among the populace helped legitimise the new empire.

## International diplomacy and the role of the great powers
Unification in both Italy and Germany cannot be understood without reference to the wider European balance of power. Austria, which had dominated northern Italy and led the German Confederation, was the principal obstacle to unity in both regions. Its defeats—first to Piedmont and France in 1859 and more decisively to Prussia in 1866—weakened its capacity to maintain hegemony. France played an ambiguous role: Napoleon III supported Piedmont in 1859 to curb Austrian influence but later backed away from fully supporting Italian ambitions; French troops protected the Papal States until 1870, blocking immediate annexation of Rome. Britain, while sympathetic to the idea of national self-determination, preferred stability and the balance of power; it played no direct military role. Russia’s attention was often elsewhere, but its occasional support for conservative order helped delay revolutionary change. Crucially, the timing of wars and diplomatic moves—such as France’s distraction by the Franco-Prussian War—created openings for nationalists. Bismarck’s skill lay in isolating enemies diplomatically and ensuring that Prussia fought on favourable terms; Cavour’s in obtaining foreign backing and exploiting opportunities created by larger powers.

## Similarities and differences: interpretation and significance
Comparing the two unification processes highlights recurring themes and important contrasts. Both movements were shaped by the tensions between popular nationalism and elite statecraft, and both required military victories to overturn the conservative order. Economic modernisation—railways, industry and the Zollverein in Germany, and Piedmont’s reforms in Italy—provided the material basis for consolidation. Yet the protagonists differed: Italian unification combined guerrilla-style popular action under figures like Garibaldi with Piedmontese diplomacy and constitutional monarchy, whereas German unification was driven by a powerful state under Bismarck’s leadership using a disciplined military machine. The role of ideology also differed: in Italy, ideological divisions between republicans, monarchists and clericalists complicated unity; in Germany, the conservative elite used nationalism to cement authoritarian state structures. The outcomes transformed Europe: the emergence of a unified Germany altered the continental balance of power, setting the stage for new rivalries, while a unified Italy created a new southern European nation whose internal challenges—regional inequality and the question of the Papacy—persisted.

## Historiographical debates and useful approaches for teaching
Historians debate the relative weight of "great men" and structural forces in explaining unification. Traditional narratives emphasise the decisive roles of Cavour, Garibaldi and Bismarck, portraying unification as the result of individual genius and statesmanship. Revisionist and structural accounts stress economic integration, social change, and the limitations of popular movements, arguing that unification was rooted in wider processes beyond personal agency. A useful classroom approach is to present sources and interpretations side by side: for example, pair a speech by Garibaldi or a contemporary newspaper with economic data on the Zollverein or a diplomatic dispatch from Cavour. Encourage students to assess provenance, motive and context, and to weigh how far individual decisions were shaped by constraints such as military capacity, international opinion or economic interests. Teaching the failed revolutions of 1848 as a pivot point helps students see change over time, demonstrating how earlier failures prompted new strategies—Cavour’s cautious diplomacy and Bismarck’s calculated use of force—that ultimately succeeded where mass uprisings did not.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Italian and German unification, begin by reading the question carefully to identify the command word—explain, assess, evaluate—and the focus, whether causation, significance, continuity and change, or comparison. For essay questions, state your argument clearly in the introduction and outline how you will support it. Use a chronological framework where helpful, but ensure each paragraph makes a clear analytical point that links evidence to the argument. Incorporate specific factual detail: key dates, battles (Solferino, Königgrätz, Sedan), treaties and diplomatic episodes (Plombières, the Ems Dispatch), and the names and roles of central figures. For source-based questions, always comment on provenance, purpose and tone before comparing the content with your contextual knowledge; use the source to support but not substitute for wider factual knowledge. When addressing interpretations, acknowledge contrasting viewpoints and assess their strengths by reference to evidence and context. Balance consideration of structural factors—economic developments, social groups, international constraints—with the agency of leaders to produce a nuanced judgement. Finally, manage your time so that you leave a few minutes to write a concise conclusion summarising your judgement and explaining how the evidence has supported it.
