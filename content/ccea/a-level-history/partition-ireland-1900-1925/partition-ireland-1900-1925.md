# Partition of Ireland and Home Rule (1900–1925) (A-level History Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment)

## Background: Home Rule and the politics of union, 1900–1912
At the start of the twentieth century the constitutional question of Ireland—whether it should be governed as part of the United Kingdom or enjoy self-government—remained unresolved but highly visible. The Irish Parliamentary Party, led until 1918 by John Redmond, continued the long nineteenth‑century campaign for Home Rule: a devolved parliament in Dublin responsible for domestic Irish affairs while the United Kingdom parliament at Westminster retained control of imperial matters. Opposition came most strongly from Ulster Protestants who identified political union with social and economic security. Unionism by 1900 had become organised and confident, drawing on an alliance between landed interests and industrialists in Belfast and the North‑East. The broader British political context was crucial: the Liberal Party, traditionally more open to devolution, faced an assertive Conservative and Unionist alliance determined to resist any legislation that threatened the Union. The parliamentary arithmetic and constitutional developments of the Edwardian period set the scene for a crisis: the Parliament Act of 1911 curtailed the Lords’ ability to veto legislation, which removed a major obstacle to Home Rule and made the introduction of a Third Home Rule Bill a real possibility.

## Ulster Unionism: mobilisation and readiness 1910–1914
Unionist opposition in Ulster moved well beyond parliamentary debate into popular mobilisation. Edward Carson emerged as the leading figure of militant unionism, articulating the existential fear of being governed by a Catholic‑majority Dublin parliament. The Ulster Unionist Council and later the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), formed in 1912–13, demonstrated that resistance could be armed as well as political. The mass signing of the Ulster Covenant in 1912 and the dramatic Larne and Belfast gun‑running operations of 1914 showed that large numbers were willing to defy Westminster and take physical measures to prevent Home Rule. These developments were not merely local theatre; they created a real military dimension to Irish politics and exposed deep fissures in British assumptions about civil obedience and the capacity of the state to enforce law and order against organised resistance. The Curragh incident of March 1914, in which British army officers signalled unwillingness to act against Ulster forces, highlighted the limits of government authority and alarmed many who thought Home Rule could be implemented peacefully.

## The Home Rule crisis, 1912–1918: law, delay and war
The Third Home Rule Bill, introduced in 1912, passed its stages in the Commons but was resisted with fury by unionists and parts of the Conservative Party. Faced with the prospect of insurrection in Ulster, the Liberal government sought compromises: “temporary exclusion” of Ulster from Home Rule and so‑called safeguards for minorities. These proposals were complex and politically toxic; neither side was satisfied. The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 changed everything. Home Rule was legally enacted through the Government of Ireland Act after long debate, but implementation was suspended for the duration of the war. The suspension bought the British government breathing space but had profound political consequences. Irish nationalists, led by Redmond, supported the war effort, hoping loyalty would secure Ireland’s constitutional future. However, the war accelerated political change in Ireland rather than resolving the question.

The Easter Rising of April 1916 transformed the political landscape. A small, poorly supported republican insurrection in Dublin was suppressed swiftly but the British response—mass arrests and executions—produced widespread sympathy for republicanism. Over the next two years Sinn Féin, which had little direct involvement in the Rising itself, became the focus for a new, more radical demand for full Irish independence. The conscription crisis of 1918 further alienated many; when the British government attempted to introduce conscription in Ireland, opposition cut across previous divisions and fed support for Sinn Féin. The December 1918 general election was a decisive turning point: Sinn Féin won an overwhelming majority of Irish seats, while the Irish Parliamentary Party was almost wiped out. Sinn Féin MPs refused to take their seats at Westminster and instead established the Dáil Éireann in Dublin in January 1919, declaring an Irish Republic.

## War of Independence and the coming of partition, 1919–1921
The Dáil’s declaration led to a guerrilla campaign by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) against British forces, a conflict characterised by ambushes, reprisals, and increasing brutality on both sides. British policing methods—most notoriously the Black and Tans and the Auxiliary Division—alienated public opinion and fuelled nationalist resistance. By 1920 the cycle of violence, political stalemate and international attention made an outright military victory for either side unlikely.

Against this background the British government sought a political settlement. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 was the immediate legislative response: it created two separate Home Rule parliaments—one for Southern Ireland and one for Northern Ireland—effectively partitioning the island. The Act allowed each parliament to legislate on domestic matters while Westminster retained sovereignty and control of imperial affairs. For unionists, the Act seemed to guarantee that Ulster would remain within the United Kingdom; for nationalists it was an inadequate compromise. Sinn Féin rejected the Act and continued the campaign for full independence. Diplomatic negotiations, influenced by changing British political calculations and war weariness, eventually produced the Anglo‑Irish Treaty of December 1921. The Treaty created the Irish Free State as a dominion within the British Commonwealth with significant internal self‑government but required an oath of allegiance to the Crown and allowed Northern Ireland to opt out—an option it exercised promptly. The Treaty was thus a compromise: substantial autonomy for the twenty‑six counties but not the full republic many republicans wanted, and retention of partition.

## Consolidation and consequences: Northern Ireland 1921–1925 and the Boundary Commission
When Northern Ireland was formalised in 1921 it comprised six of Ulster’s nine counties. Sir James Craig became its first Prime Minister and his government rapidly set about creating institutions: a devolved parliament at Stormont, new administrative structures, and security measures aimed at maintaining unionist control in a contested society. The early years were marked by communal violence, economic dislocation and the use of robust security legislation. The Northern Ireland government introduced measures such as internment and broad police powers to respond to perceived threats; the result was a society where a Protestant majority consolidated political dominance, while many Catholics felt increasingly marginalised.

The Treaty’s promise of a Boundary Commission to consider the frontier between North and South raised hopes among nationalists that the border might be redrawn to transfer nationalist areas to the Free State. The Commission was established but ultimately failed to deliver significant changes. Leaks and diplomatic manoeuvres, culminating in the 1925 agreement between the British and Irish Free State governments, effectively froze the border close to its 1921 line. In return the Free State accepted responsibility for a financial settlement. The failure of the Boundary Commission removed a key avenue for peaceful revision of the frontier and confirmed partition as a lasting settlement, at least for the immediate future.

The southern state faced its own turbulence: the Treaty split the republican movement and produced a bitter civil war in 1922–23 between pro‑Treaty forces, who formed the core of the Free State government, and anti‑Treaty republicans. That conflict shaped the new Free State’s politics and institutions, consolidating a route to sovereignty that would evolve over subsequent decades into full independence.

## Understanding continuity, change and significance in the period
When revising this period it is useful to frame developments through the concepts central to A‑level history: causation, continuity and change, and significance. The immediate cause of partition lay in the political impasse between organised Ulster unionism and nationalist demand for Home Rule; longer‑term causes included demographic patterns, economic divergence between industrial Ulster and more agrarian south, and the failure of nineteenth‑century constitutional nationalism to accommodate sectarian fears. Continuities can be traced in long‑standing patterns of communal division, the political centrality of land and religion, and the dominance of British strategic interests in Irish affairs. Changes are visible in the shift from constitutional nationalism under the Irish Parliamentary Party to revolutionary republicanism under Sinn Féin, the emergence of mass political mobilisation in Ulster and the south, and the creation of new state structures on both sides of the border. The significance of events such as the Easter Rising, the 1918 election, the War of Independence and the Treaty must be judged not only by immediate outcomes but by their long‑term impact on identity, governance and inter‑community relations on the island.

In essays, connect specific episodes to wider themes: for example, link the Curragh incident and the Larne gun‑running to questions about the limits of state authority; relate the rise of Sinn Féin to changes in public opinion produced by wartime policies and British reprisals; and treat the Government of Ireland Act 1920 both as a legislative attempt to resolve the crisis and as a pragmatic recognition that partition was the most feasible political solution at that moment.

## Exam technique
Approach questions with a clear plan and explicit engagement with the focus of the question. For causation essays, outline short‑ and long‑term causes, explain relative weight and link to the question throughout. For change‑over‑time questions, define the parameters of continuity and change and support claims with dated examples. When tackling source‑based questions, always consider provenance: who produced the source, when and why, and how does that shape reliability? Use the content of sources critically: what do they show, what do they omit, and how useful are they for answering the specific question? When comparing interpretations, identify the argument each historian makes, relate it to the evidence, and evaluate strengths and weaknesses—do interpretations reflect different emphases on class, religion, political strategy or international context?

Structure paragraphs around a clear point, evidence that includes specific events or quotations, explanation that links evidence to the argument, and a short concluding sentence that ties back to the question. Time management is vital: allocate time proportional to marks, leave minutes at the end to proofread, and ensure essays have a firm introduction setting out your argument and a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Finally, synthesise across the period: examiners reward answers that place events in context, assess change and continuity, and show an ability to weigh interpretations rather than listing events.
