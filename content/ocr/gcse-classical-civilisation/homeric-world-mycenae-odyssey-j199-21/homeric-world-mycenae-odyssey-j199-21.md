# The Homeric World: Mycenae & Odyssey (OCR J199/21) (GCSE Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction and what this option covers
The Homeric World option asks you to combine two kinds of study: the material culture of the Mycenaean world and a close reading of selected books from Homer’s Odyssey. The culture section takes you into the Late Bronze Age kingdoms centred on Mycenae and Tiryns (roughly the second half of the second millennium BC), exploring palaces, tombs, art and everyday life as revealed by archaeology. The literature section asks you to study Books 9, 10, 19, 21 and 22 of the Odyssey, paying attention to plot, characterisation, themes and the techniques Homer uses. In the examination you will be expected to deploy your knowledge of archaeological objects and sites alongside carefully chosen evidence from the Odyssey, and to show awareness of how different kinds of sources reflect their contexts and might be interpreted in different ways.

## The Mycenaean world: sites, palaces and society
Mycenaean civilisation is the archaeological culture that flourished on mainland Greece in the Late Bronze Age and which later Greeks identified as the heroic world behind their legends. Key sites are Mycenae and Tiryns, with palatial complexes built around a central hall or megaron, massive “Cyclopean” walls and elaborate gateways such as the Lion Gate at Mycenae. Palaces functioned as administrative, economic and ritual centres: they controlled storage, craft production and long-distance trade, and they hosted elites whose identities are partly reconstructed through objects and tombs. The society that built these sites appears hierarchical and martial in parts, signalled by finds of weapons, chariot fittings and fortified citadels, yet it was also engaged with the wider eastern Mediterranean by trade and cultural exchange. When you discuss Mycenae in answers, make sure you explain what the archaeological evidence actually shows and what reasonable inferences can be made about social structure and daily life, while acknowledging the limits of the evidence.

## Material culture: tombs, frescoes, goldwork and Linear B
Mycenaean material culture gives vivid, sometimes surprising insights. The spectacular finds from Grave Circle A at Mycenae — including gold masks (one famously labelled by Schliemann as “the Mask of Agamemnon”), gold vessels, a dagger blade with an inlaid hunting scene, and richly ornamented rhyta — reveal elite display, craftsmanship and connections with Aegean and Near Eastern decorative traditions. Tomb architecture ranges from deep shaft graves to beehive-shaped tholos tombs and chamber burials, and these different forms reflect evolving funerary practices and social signalling. Frescoes and small-scale objects show themes of hunting, processions and ritual, while storage jars and Linear B clay tablets (found at palaces such as Pylos) provide documentary evidence of palace administration, redistributive economies and specialised crafts. When using these sources in essays, describe what an object looks like, say where it was found and discuss its original use, its social meaning, and any problems with interpretation (for example, later disturbance of graves or the selective survival of durable materials).

## Homer, oral poetry and the composition of the Odyssey
The Odyssey as we read it is a product of long oral tradition, probably crystallised into its current epic form in the early first millennium BC, though it preserves memories and motifs that look back to earlier Bronze Age material. Homeric poetry uses formulaic language, repeated epithets and extended similes, features that helped performers compose and remember long narrative. The poem was intended for performance to an audience, and recognising this helps when you analyse scenes: speeches, dramatic reversals and vivid similes are crafted for immediate impact. The connection between archaeological Mycenae and the world Homer describes is complex: some palace details in the Odyssey echo early Bronze Age layouts, but the poem mixes elements from many periods and is not a straightforward historical source. In exam answers you should therefore be cautious: you can draw useful comparisons between the Homeric picture of palaces and archaeological evidence, but avoid treating the Odyssey as literal history.

## Key themes and characters in the prescribed books
The books prescribed for study contain several of the Odyssey’s best-known episodes and a compact set of themes worth exploring in detail. Book 9 (the Cyclops) confronts the rules of hospitality, or xenia: the Cyclops’ savagery is set against Greek expectations that hosts and guests must show restraint and exchange gifts. Book 10 (the stay with Circe) combines danger and enchantment while developing themes of transformation and the rightful restoration of order, with Odysseus’ cleverness and the dependence of humans on divine aid highlighted. Book 19 advances the recognition plot and the role of Penelope, foregrounding loyalty, cunning and the domestic authority of the palace; Book 21 (the contest of the bow) is the dramatic reversal in which Odysseus’ unique skill proves his identity; and Book 22, the slaughter of the suitors, forces readers to confront questions of justice, revenge and community restoration. Throughout these books Odysseus is presented as a complex hero: brave and resourceful, but also deceitful and at times morally ambiguous. Athena’s patronage and Poseidon’s enmity structure the narrative, but human choices and social norms — hospitality, loyalty, and honour — are central concerns. When you write about characters, show how Homer uses speeches, similes, and narrative viewpoint to shape sympathy and judgement.

## Approaching the prescribed passages: reading, context and classroom focus
To get the most out of the prescribed books, combine close textual reading with contextual knowledge. For Book 9, pay attention to the structure of Odysseus’ speech, how he presents himself and his men, and the moment of the name-trick (“Nobody”) which reveals Homeric features of cunning (metis) and narrative irony; consider also what the Cyclops episode says about civilisation versus barbarism and how it plays with expectations of xenia. In Book 10, focus on the transformation motif: Circe’s turning of men into animals, the role of Hermes’ herb, and the staged return to the ship which shows how wisdom and ritual knowledge restore the social order. Book 19 needs careful attention to Penelope’s interactions with the disguised Odysseus, her weaving metaphor and the way recognition is delayed; this is a rich source for discussing gender and power in the palace. In Book 21 examine how the test with the bow functions as narrative proof, the symbols of the bow and its associations with Odysseus’ lineage, and the dramatic economy of the scene. Book 22 is often emotionally demanding: look for Homeric techniques that build tension, the role of the slaves and Telemachus, and how divine intervention frames what would otherwise be collective slaughter. In the classroom, encourage students to annotate speeches, mark recurring epithets and similes, and practice turning descriptive comments into evaluation — asking why Homer wants the audience to react in a certain way to a character or event.

## Linking Homeric literature to Mycenaean archaeology
Exam questions sometimes invite you to compare literary and material sources. Use archaeological evidence to illuminate the Odyssey, but do so carefully. The megaron-like palace scenes in the poem resonate with archaeological plans of Mycenaean palaces: the central hall, the ceremonial role of feasting, and the importance of display can be usefully compared. Funerary practice in Mycenae and the prominence of found grave goods can be contrasted with Homeric attitudes to the dead and graves. Decorative themes on Mycenaean daggers or frescoes — hunting scenes and animals — can be compared to imagery in poetic similes and descriptions. At the same time, explain the limits of such comparisons: Homer’s world is a literary mosaic created many centuries after the height of the Mycenaean palaces, and the poet adapts older traditions to a new social imagination. In an answer that compares the two kinds of evidence, make sure you identify the provenance and original function of material sources and use them to support, not replace, close reading of the poem.

## Exam technique
In the exam you will need to show knowledge (AO1) and analysis/evaluation (AO2). For J199/21 the paper is divided into a Culture section and a Literature section, each carrying equal marks; plan to spend roughly half your time on each section. Begin literature answers with a concise point that directly addresses the question, then support it with precise references to the prescribed books — name the book, summarise the relevant episode in one or two sentences, and quote or paraphrase key lines or moments to support your reading. For the culture section always identify the object or site by name and provenance, describe it accurately, and then discuss its use, social meaning and possible modern or ancient interpretations. When asked to compare a literary and a material source, set out points of similarity and difference and evaluate why those sources present events or people differently, referring to purpose, audience and context. Use technical vocabulary such as megaron, tholos, xenia, nostos and metis correctly, but explain what the terms mean when you first use them. Balance description and analysis: concise description establishes AO1, but your AO2 marks come from interpretation, linking evidence to argument and considering alternative readings. Time management is crucial; leave a few minutes at the end to reread longer answers, check that you have directly answered the question and made clear, supported conclusions. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions and get feedback that focuses both on factual accuracy and on the clarity and cogency of your argument.
