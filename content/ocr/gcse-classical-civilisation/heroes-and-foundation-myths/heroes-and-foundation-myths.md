# Heroes and foundation myths (Heracles, Theseus, Romulus, Aeneas) (GCSE Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why heroes matter
Founding myths and the heroes who populate them are central to how the ancient Greeks and Romans understood themselves. Heroes such as Heracles, Theseus, Romulus and Aeneas are not just exciting characters in stories; they are embodiments of social values, political claims and religious practice. They explain the origins of cities and institutions, they provide models of behaviour for citizens and rulers, and they appear again and again on monuments, coins and temple sculptures. In this topic you will need to know the main episodes associated with each hero, how those episodes were told by different authors, and how visual and material culture was used to present the heroic past to ancient audiences. You will also need to be able to compare Greek and Roman versions of the same basic ideas: for the Greeks the hero often anchors civic identity and local cult; for the Romans myth is frequently employed to justify imperial rule and collective origins.

## Heracles / Hercules: the universal hero
Heracles is the most mobile of Greek heroes: his myths travel across the Greek world and are adopted by the Romans as Hercules. The core of his myth in Greek traditions is the Twelve Labours, a cycle of tasks that transform him from a tormented exile into a civilising figure who overcomes chaos and dangerous creatures. In literature and on monuments the labours are a visual shorthand for Heracles’ strength and endurance, and they are famously depicted on the sculptures of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. Heracles is also linked to ritual and athletic identity; he is presented as the founder or patron of athletic contests at Olympia, a connection that ties his personal glory to communal religious practice. The stories of Heracles’ later life—his battles with Achelous and Nessus and the poisonous shirt that causes his death—culminate in his apotheosis, a transformation into a god, which allowed both Greeks and Romans to claim divine favour for the hero. In Roman tradition Hercules becomes a protector of the community, appearing in tales such as Hercules and Cacus near the Tiber and being a figure used by Roman authors to underline Rome’s strength and destiny. Recognise Heracles’ common attributes in art: club, lion-skin and muscular form, and remember that different texts (Homeric Hymns, Ovid, parts of classical sculpture) offer different emphases—Homeric material often preserves an older heroic tone, Ovid and later poets allow for more psychological or ironic readings.

## Theseus and the civic hero of Athens
Theseus is an essentially civic hero: his exploits are tied to the creation and consolidation of Athens. His journey to Crete to slay the Minotaur, his victories over monstrous foes on the road to Athens, and his role in uniting Attica around the city were stories used by Athenians to explain their political identity and institutions. Vase-paintings such as the Theseus kylix show key episodes—Theseus’ entry into the labyrinth, the slaying of the Minotaur, and his return—making the narrative accessible in domestic and ritual contexts. Plutarch’s biography of Theseus preserves versions of these stories and importantly supplies material for comparison with Roman foundation myths; Plutarch explicitly contrasts Theseus with Romulus, treating both as political founders whose lives offer moral lessons. Theseus is also used to explore themes of leadership, law and justice: the mythical accounts often portray him reforming or consolidating local customs, fighting pirates and brigands, and creating the basis for Athenian rule. When you study Theseus, look at how the myths connect to Athenian festivals, how vase imagery helps fix episodes in the public imagination, and how writers like Plutarch use the hero as a vehicle for discussing civic virtues.

## Aeneas and the Trojan origin of Rome
Aeneas occupies a special place in Roman myth because he provides a Trojan precursor to Roman civilization. The story of Aeneas fleeing the fall of Troy, wandering in the Mediterranean and finally settling in Italy is used by Roman authors to link Rome’s origins to the heroic age of the Greeks and to set up a divine destiny for Rome’s people. Virgil’s Aeneid is the single most influential literary treatment of Aeneas’ voyage and settlement; Book 8 in particular (the prescribed extract) presents Aeneas as pious, dutiful and destined to found a line that will lead to Alba Longa and, eventually, to Rome itself. Virgil gives Aeneas an ideological role: he is not only a survivor but a carrier of pietas and future greatness. In Roman art and propaganda Aeneas and his descendants were used to legitimise political claims, especially under Augustus, who promoted the Trojan ancestry of his regime to connect the new order to a revered past. When studying Aeneas, remember that different sources approach his character differently: the Aeneid reads like epic propaganda with literary sophistication and Augustan undertones, while earlier or alternative accounts may stress other aspects of his wandering or his role as a refugee and leader.

## Romulus, Remus and the founding of Rome
The twin brothers Romulus and Remus are the most famous founders in Roman myth. Their story provides an origin for the city of Rome itself: born of a union between a mortal and a royal line with divine associations, abandoned and suckled by a she-wolf, rescued by shepherds, and later quarrelling over the location and rule of the new city, the tale culminates in Romulus killing Remus and becoming the first king of Rome. Livy’s early history presents this narrative with a blend of moralising detail and civic explanation. The Romulus myth explains not only the name of the city, but also socially important institutions: the formation of the Roman population, the role of asylum, the incorporation of neighbours and the origins of certain religious practices. Romans used the story to justify both the city’s martial nature and its social order. In addition, Romulus was later accorded divine honours under the name Quirinus, a pattern seen in other heroes who become deified or cult figures. When you compare Romulus and Remus with Greek foundation heroes, note how Roman accounts emphasise collective destiny, legal and religious institutions, and the incorporation of diverse peoples rather than the more local or city-focused achievements of Greek heroes like Theseus.

## Comparing heroes and their functions
When you put these heroes side by side, patterns and contrasts emerge that are useful for essays and source work. Heracles is pan-Hellenic and transgressive: his labours take him across the world and his story is useful for athletic and panhellenic identity as well as for imperial Roman self-fashioning; Theseus is local and civic, a symbol of political unification and reform for Athens; Aeneas is ancestral and providential, a vehicle for Roman claims to destiny and continuity with Troy; Romulus embodies the founding violence and legal origins of Rome, giving narrative shape to institutions from the Senate to the military. The ways in which these heroes appear in literature vary with authorial purpose: Plutarch offers moral comparison and biography, Livy provides patriotic and didactic history, Virgil produces poetic myth-shaping with political purpose, and Ovid offers inventive and sometimes subversive retellings. Visual culture responds to these textual traditions: temple friezes and civic monuments select episodes that serve local pride or imperial ideology, while vase scenes and funerary reliefs embed heroic exempla into private life. A good comparison essay will use specific moments from texts and images—such as the Labours carved at Olympia, the Theseus kylix, the shield of Aeneas in Virgil, or the Ara Pacis imagery—to show how different communities used myth to explain present realities.

## Myth, cult and artistic representation
Founding myths do not remain only on the page; they are lived in cults, festivals and civic display. Temples, altars and public ceremonies were ways to keep a hero present in the minds of citizens. The Parthenon frieze, with its battle scenes and mythic references, and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, with its sculpture cycle of heroic scenes, show how mythic episodes are tied to public worship and political self-assertion. Roman monuments such as the Ara Pacis and the Augustus of Prima Porta statue repurpose mythic language to create imperial narratives: mythic ancestry, divine favour and the virtues of leaders are made visible in relief and statuary. Festivals and local rites—those associated with Heracles at Olympia or the Lupercalia connected to Romulus and Remus—turn stories into recurring social acts, reinforcing identity. When you study visual sources, pay attention to what is depicted, where it was placed, who commissioned it, and what message it communicated to contemporary viewers. Consider also how myths could be adapted: a Greek hero might be framed as an Olympic benefactor, while the same figure in Roman hands becomes evidence of Roman magnanimity or military protection.

## Exam technique
Answering questions about heroes and foundation myths requires both accurate knowledge and the ability to use sources to make a clear argument. Begin by reading the question carefully and identifying whether it asks for description, comparison, explanation or evaluation. Use specific details from the prescribed literary extracts and visual sources: name the text and author when relevant, describe key episodes and mention distinctive visual features (for example, Heracles’ lion-skin and club, the Minotaur scene on a kylix, the wolf in early Roman iconography, or the shield given to Aeneas in Book 8). When comparing Greek and Roman material, make explicit links between the story and its social or political function. Balance narrative with analysis: do not simply retell a myth, but explain what it meant for ancient audiences and how different sources present it. When discussing visual material, note original location and purpose, and combine this with literary evidence to strengthen your interpretation. In longer responses plan a clear structure with an introduction that states your argument, paragraphs that develop and support it with evidence, and a brief conclusion that sums up your judgement. Remember the assessment objectives: AO1 rewards accurate knowledge and context, AO2 rewards analysis and evaluation; aim to demonstrate both. Finally, practise with past-style questions using the prescribed sources and unseen extracts; rehearsing how to integrate quotations, descriptions of images and comparisons will make your answers confident and well‑paced on the day.
