# Source analysis and comparative skills (AO1 & AO2) (GCSE Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

Understanding how to work with ancient sources is central to success in OCR GCSE Classical Civilisation. The two Assessment Objectives you must satisfy are AO1, which tests knowledge and understanding of literature and visual/material culture and how sources reflect their cultural contexts, and AO2, which tests your ability to analyse, interpret and evaluate those same sources. Across the qualification AO1 carries the greater share of marks (60% of the total) while AO2 makes up the remaining 40%, so exam answers must combine secure factual knowledge with careful, evidence-based analysis and reasoned judgement.

## What we mean by a source: literary and visual/material culture

Ancient evidence takes two broad forms: literary texts and visual or material remains. Literary sources include epic, drama, history, satire, letters and inscriptions. In this specification these will be set texts such as Homer’s Odyssey, selected passages from the Homeric Hymns, parts of Virgil’s Aeneid or selected Roman satire and letters. Visual and material sources include architecture, sculpture, funerary stelai, wall-paintings, domestic layouts, coins and monuments such as Trajan’s Column, the Parthenon frieze, the Ara Pacis or house-plans at Pompeii. Each type of source offers different kinds of information. A poem can reveal values, emotions and arguments through language and literary technique; a building or statue can reveal ritual use, patronage and public image through layout, iconography and materiality. When you study a theme you will normally be expected to bring both kinds of evidence together, using literary passages to illuminate beliefs and attitudes while using material culture to show how those beliefs were expressed in public and private life.

## Provenance, purpose and audience: the first questions to ask

Every successful source analysis starts by asking where the source comes from, why it was made and who saw it. For a poem this means considering the poet, the genre and the intended listeners or readers; for instance, the Homeric Hymn to Demeter was composed within a religious and oral-performance tradition and shapes understanding of myth and ritual. For a sculpture or building you should identify when and where it was produced, who commissioned it, and how people interacted with it: the Parthenon frieze was designed for the Panathenaic procession and thus communicates civic ideology to Athenians; the Ara Pacis, set up in Rome under Augustus, presents imperial family and peace imagery to a Roman audience. These basic facts — date, place, maker/commissioner and original setting — are AO1 material. AO2 then asks you to explain how those facts shape the source’s message and reliability. A public monument is likely to represent official ideology more than private experience, while a satire or a letter may reveal personal attitudes or objections.

## Reading the source closely: language, form and iconography

Close reading means attending to the specific ways a source communicates. For literary texts look for narrative techniques, diction and rhetorical devices. In the Odyssey you might discuss the use of formulaic epithets, extended similes and speeches to construct Odysseus as both cunning and morally ambiguous. In Virgil’s Aeneid consider how imagery and speeches create sympathy or criticism for particular characters. For visual and material sources focus on pose, gesture, iconographic attributes and composition. A statue such as Augustus of Prima Porta carries symbolic objects, a contrapposto stance and a breastplate scene that combine to present Augustus as divinely sanctioned commander. When you describe such features give precise details — the objects shown on a relief, the position of an altar in a temple plan, or a particular line in a lyric — and then explain their likely significance for contemporary viewers. Doing this shows both secure AO1 knowledge and the AO2 skill of interpreting how form produces meaning.

## Comparing Greek and Roman evidence: bridging cultures and themes

A distinctive requirement in the thematic papers is the comparative study of Greek and Roman responses to the same theme. You may be asked to compare a Greek literary source with a Roman visual source, or vice versa, and you must be able to move between cultural contexts. Start by identifying the shared theme — for example, foundation myths, the representation of a hero, religious practice, or attitudes to women — and then set out the specific perspectives each culture offers. Comparing the Theseus kylix with Plutarch’s comparison of Theseus and Romulus invites you to discuss how hero-founders legitimise political institutions in Greek and Roman thought. Comparing the Centauromachy on the Parthenon with the Amazonomachy or with imagery on the Ara Pacis allows you to discuss myth as a symbol of civic order and imperial power. Effective comparisons do not simply list differences; they explain why those differences matter, tying them to social, political or religious contexts and showing how each source shapes a contemporary audience’s understanding of the theme.

## Using prescribed and unseen sources: building a wider evidence base

The exam will include questions on prescribed sources that you must know well, and will also include some unseen material. Familiarity with the prescribed material gives confidence, but preparing broadly is essential for handling unseen items. Make sure you can place each prescribed source in its context and can quote or describe key passages and features. At the same time, practice applying the same lines of analysis to unfamiliar material: ask the same questions of an unseen inscription, relief, or short passage as you would of a known source. Cross-referencing is a powerful technique: when you see an unseen fresco of a domestic scene, bring in knowledge of Pompeian house-plans, the function of the atrium, and literary depictions of dinner parties to enrich and test your interpretation. The exam rewards students who can combine close reading of the source in front of them with broader contextual knowledge.

## Constructing balanced, evidence-driven answers

A high-quality answer makes specific points supported by precise evidence and logical explanation. Begin with a brief opening statement that locates the source and outlines your approach, then move to focused paragraphs that combine description and analysis. For AO1 include relevant factual material about date, place, genre and cultural background; for AO2 explain what the features you describe suggest about purpose, audience and meaning, and evaluate how persuasive the source is as evidence. Where appropriate, acknowledge bias or limited perspective: a public commemorative monument may be propagandistic, an epic may stylise social realities, and a funeral stele will reflect elite values rather than the lives of ordinary people. Use comparative judgement to weigh sources against each other: when two sources give different pictures, consider who made each one, for whom and why, and which aspects are more likely to reflect lived experience. Conclude with a short, synthetic judgement that answers the question directly and reiterates how your evidence supports it.

## Reaching the higher grade descriptors: depth, discrimination and clarity

To reach the top grades you must combine comprehensive and accurate AO1 material with perceptive AO2 analysis. That means going beyond description to offer nuanced interpretations, showing awareness of different possible readings, and explaining both what a source is saying and why it says it in that way. Perceptive answers often mobilise a range of sources, bring in precise details from texts and objects, and attend to counter-evidence or alternative perspectives. For example, when discussing Roman attitudes to foreign queens compare Roman literary portrayals of Cleopatra with the political imagery of Actium reliefs and with Octavian’s coinage; show how literary invective and imperial imagery work together to delegitimise an opponent while also noting where poetry and visual propaganda differ in emphasis. Clear structure, careful selection of relevant facts and consistent linking back to the question will make such sophisticated analysis readable and convincing.

## Exam technique

In the exam, begin by reading the whole paper and underlining command words. For source-based questions spend the first minute establishing the source’s identity and context: state its type, date and original location if given or reasonably inferable. Then describe key features concisely and move quickly to analysis: explain what those features tell you about purpose and audience. When asked to compare, set up a clear axis of comparison (for instance: purpose, representation of power, role of ritual, or portrayal of gender) and address the Greek and Roman material on each limb of that axis rather than treating them as isolated paragraphs. Use specific detail: a line from the Homeric Hymn, the depiction of Athena on a kylix, the placement of an altar in the Temple of Zeus, the iconography on the Prima Porta breastplate, or an inscription from Pompeii will strengthen your answer. If a question uses an unseen source, focus on what you can say confidently and then support that with wider contextual knowledge. Manage your time so extended responses have a clear introduction, two or three developed analytical paragraphs and a short conclusion that answers the question directly. Finally, write with precision: define technical terms when relevant, avoid sweeping generalisations unsupported by evidence, and make sure your judgement is explicit and justified by the sources you have discussed.
