# Roman City Life: homes, family and leisure (OCR J199/22) (GCSE Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what this topic covers and why it matters
Roman City Life asks you to step into the streets, homes and public spaces of cities such as Rome, Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia and to use what people wrote and what they left behind to build a picture of everyday life. The component combines a “Culture” study of urban institutions, housing, family and leisure with a “Literature” study that uses authors who observe, mock or record city living. Together these give you the two lenses required by OCR’s specification: material/visual culture and literature. You will be expected to know what objects and buildings looked like and what authors said about them, and to bring these sources together when answering questions. The topic is especially useful because it links the tangible remains that survive in the archaeological record with lively literary descriptions, allowing you to evaluate how representative different types of evidence are.

## The urban setting and key sites
Roman cities were highly varied but shared many features: public monuments and entertainment complexes, temples, baths, markets, streets and a mix of rich houses and crowded apartment blocks. Pompeii and Herculaneum are particularly important because the eruption of Vesuvius preserved whole houses, frescoes, mosaics, shop fronts and even graffiti, giving exceptional detail about domestic decoration, food, names and day-to-day life. Ostia, as Rome’s port, shows commercial and working-class life in apartment buildings such as the Insula of Diana. In Rome itself the Colosseum and the Circus Maximus dominate evidence for large-scale public spectacle. When you study Roman City Life you should be familiar with specific sites named in the specification (for example the House of Menander and the House of Octavius Quartio in Pompeii, the central baths at Herculaneum and the Insula of Diana at Ostia) and be able to describe their layout, decoration and surviving features. Remember that the function and display of these places — whether a formal atrium house with painted walls or an insula crowded with small rooms — shaped how people lived and how others saw them.

## Homes, decoration and daily routines
Roman housing falls into two broad types for this topic: the private, often lavish domus of wealthier citizens and the multi-storey insulae (blocks of flats) that housed urban poor and many freedmen. A typical Pompeian domus had a street entrance leading into an atrium with an impluvium (a shallow pool) and a tablinum (a reception or office area), and a rear peristyle garden surrounded by rooms decorated with frescoes and mosaics. The House of Menander and the House of Octavius Quartio offer clear examples of decorative schemes and domestic art, and you should be able to describe how painted scenes and mosaic floors produced a message about status, taste and cultural priorities. Insulae like the Insula of Diana show cramped accommodation, multiple households, shops on the ground floor and evidence for different living standards within the same block.

Daily routines in the Roman home could include family meals such as the cena (dinner), which could be a sociable and staged event involving reclining at table, entertainment and a ritual of invitation and status. Domestic slaves performed cooking, cleaning and other services, while some households employed skilled slaves for trades or intellectual work. The archaeological record — from kitchen remains and cooking vessels to furniture fittings and personal objects — can be read alongside literary descriptions to reconstruct daily life, but you must always consider the bias of both kinds of source: wealthy houses are over-represented archaeologically, while elite authors are more likely to describe the upper end of society.

## Family, education and social structure
Family and social structure were the organising principles of Roman city life. The paterfamilias was the male head of the household with legal authority over family members; patrons and clients formed networks of loyalty and obligation that structured political and social life. Citizenship, senatorial and equestrian status, property qualifications and the roles of freedmen all shaped a person’s opportunities and reputation. Slavery was central to the urban economy: slaves worked in shops, houses and public services, and could hold a range of skills. Freedmen occupied an ambivalent social position — able to gain wealth and influence but often limited in political rights and subject to social prejudice.

Education prepared children for adult life and was organised into stages. Young boys (and sometimes girls from wealthier families) began with the litterator for basic reading and writing, progressed to a grammaticus for literature and language, and some advanced to a rhetor for public speaking and political life. The equipment used in schools — stylus and wax tablet, pens, ink and papyrus — survive in the textual record and are echoed in visual representations. Marriage practices, dowries and the legal distinctions between different forms of marriage determined women’s legal position and property rights. In your answers you should be able to explain roles and rights and to contrast experiences across social classes and between different urban settings.

## Leisure, spectacle and public life
Leisure was a public and highly visible feature of Roman urban life. The amphitheatre, with the Colosseum as its most famous example, hosted gladiatorial combats, animal hunts and public executions; the Circus Maximus staged chariot racing that enjoyed mass popular devotion and intense factional rivalries. Theatres hosted comedies, mime and pantomime; the baths combined exercise, bathing and socialising within complex buildings containing frigidarium, tepidarium, caldarium and palaestra. These spaces were arenas for social display and for political and social relationships: games were often sponsored by emperors or politicians seeking public favour, and seating arrangements could reflect social rank. Gladiators trained in ludus schools and had a distinctive social status which could combine low social standing with celebrity; charioteers could become immensely popular and wealthy.

When studying leisure, you should be able to describe the design and purpose of the main types of building, explain who used them and why, and consider how literary authors and material culture represent these activities. The specification expects familiarity with the Colosseum and Circus Maximus, and with the ways Roman authors write about the spectacle — whether sarcastically, admiringly or critically.

## Literary and material evidence: reading sources and their limits
A central challenge in Roman City Life is reading different kinds of evidence together. The literature prescribed for this component — Horace’s Satires, Juvenal’s Satire 3, Petronius’ Satyricon (the Dinner with Trimalchio) and letters by Pliny — offer vivid, often opinionated views of city life. Horace tends to satirise gently and offer moralising observation; Juvenal shows the anxieties and outraged tone of a satirist reacting to urban excess and danger; Petronius fashions a fictional dinner that parodies social climbing and freedman ostentation; Pliny’s letters provide a personal, documentary tone that records real people, social networks and events. These literary voices are invaluable but must be read as rhetorical products that aim to entertain, instruct or criticise.

Material and visual sources — houses, frescoes and mosaics, public monuments, inscriptions and graffiti — give direct, physical evidence. Pompeian wall-paintings and mosaics show decoration, mythological scenes and everyday motifs; tombs and inscriptions record names, careers and dedications; shop fronts and electoral notices scratched on walls reveal political life at street level. Archaeological preservation is uneven: the ash that conserved Pompeii is a unique survival that biases our picture towards the Pompeian snapshot. Always evaluate what an object can tell you about function, audience and intended message, and remember problems such as survival bias, representativeness and modern interpretation. Good answers combine specific visual or literary examples with critical explanation of what each source can and cannot prove.

## Exam technique
In the exam, clear planning and source-based thinking will earn marks because questions require both AO1 knowledge and AO2 analysis. Start with a short plan: identify the key point you will make, the evidence you will use (naming specific houses, monuments or passages), and how you will balance description with analysis. For short-answer questions aim for concise, accurate facts that directly address the question; for extended responses structure your answer into paragraphs each with a clear point, evidence and explanation. When using literature, quote or summarise a relevant line or episode and explain its significance; when using material culture, describe the object or building and its original context: for example, note that the atrium of a domus served both a practical and a social purpose or that graffiti in Pompeii often records electoral slogans as working-class political activity.

Comparative questions require you to weigh similarities and differences: when comparing rich houses and insulae, discuss both architectural differences and what they tell us about social inequality; when comparing literary and archaeological evidence, explain why an author’s view might be biased and what the material evidence corroborates or contradicts. Use the prescribed sources named in the specification as anchors in your answer — for Roman City Life mention examples such as the House of Menander, the Insula of Diana, the Colosseum, the Circus Maximus, Petronius’ Trimalchio and Pliny’s letters — and make sure you explain their relevance rather than simply naming them.

Time management is essential: allocate time proportionally to the marks available, leave a few minutes to check a longer essay and make sure your conclusion clearly answers the question asked. In evaluation-style questions aim for a balanced judgement and avoid simple one-sided statements; instead show awareness of different points of view and end with a reasoned conclusion that draws on both literature and material culture. Finally, practise past-style questions under timed conditions, and revise by linking specific examples to themes (housing, family, leisure) so that in the exam you can deploy precise evidence confidently and persuasively.
