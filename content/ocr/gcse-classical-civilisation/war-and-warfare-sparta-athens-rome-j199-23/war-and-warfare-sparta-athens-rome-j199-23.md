# War and Warfare: Sparta, Athens and Rome (OCR J199/23) (GCSE Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what this topic covers and why it matters
War and warfare in the classical world shaped politics, society and identity across Greece and Rome. The OCR J199/23 component asks you to study warfare in three contrasting contexts: Sparta and Athens in the fifth century BC, and Rome in the Imperial period. You will look at how armies and navies were raised, equipped and commanded; at key battles and campaigns and their consequences; and at how warfare was represented in literature and material culture. This topic connects practical military detail—training, tactics, pay and organisation—with the human and cultural consequences of violence: glory and heroism, fear and suffering, civic pride and memory. Understanding both the facts of warfare and the ways authors and artists shaped responses to war will help you make balanced, evidence-based judgements in the exam.

## Sparta in the fifth century BC: society, training and Thermopylae
Spartan society was built around military readiness. From childhood the agoge trained Spartan males to be disciplined, hardy and collectively loyal. Education in the agoge combined physical training, comradeship through the syssitia (common messes), and an emphasis on obedience and endurance. Spartan military structure reflected the social system: full citizens (Spartiates) supplied hoplite soldiers, while perioikoi (free non-citizens) and helots (state-owned serfs) supported the economy and sometimes supplemented forces. In battle Spartans fought as heavy infantry in the hoplite phalanx, a close, disciplined formation whose strength lay in cohesion and mutual protection rather than manoeuvre.

Thermopylae (480 BC) is the classic case study for Spartan ideology and action. A small Greek force led by Leonidas held the narrow pass against Xerxes’ Persian invasion, buying time for other Greek cities. Although militarily a defeat, Thermopylae became a powerful symbol of self-sacrifice and duty. The combination of documentary accounts, later literary treatment and visual commemorations (statues, votive dedications and helmet finds) allows you to discuss both the historical events and the cultural uses of the story: how a military episode becomes a civic myth that values honour and collective resistance.

## Athens in the fifth century BC: navy, citizens and Salamis
Athens contrasted sharply with Sparta. Its military power depended on a large fleet of triremes and on broad-based civic participation. The construction and maintenance of the fleet were major civic expenses; key reforms and decisions—most famously Themistocles’ push to build and equip more ships—turned the Athenians into a naval power. Triremes were light, fast warships designed for manoeuvre and ramming but also for close fighting when necessary. Effective trireme tactics relied on skilled oarsmen, experienced captains and coordinated formations such as the diekplous and periplous to outmanoeuvre heavier vessels.

The Battle of Salamis (480 BC) was the naval turning point in the Persian Wars. Facing a numerically larger Persian fleet, the Greeks used the constraining geography of the straits and their superior seamanship to win a decisive victory. Themistocles’ cunning and the contribution of allied commanders were central, and the role of figures such as Artemisia—an allied commander who won Xerxes’ attention—provides material for exploring non-Athenian perspectives. In Athens the navy also had social and political effects: sea power enabled imperial expansion, funded public works, and broadened political participation by rewarding citizens who served at sea, while also exposing Athens to the costs and responsibilities of empire.

## The Roman Imperial military: organisation, tactics and campaigns
The Roman army of the Imperial period was an institutional force designed to control a vast and diverse empire. Recruitment combined voluntary enlistment from Roman citizens and the use of non-citizen auxiliary troops who provided specialist skills and, after service, could gain citizenship. Training created highly disciplined units able to build fortifications, march long distances and fight reliably. A legion was the core heavy infantry unit; in the Imperial period it was arranged into cohorts and centuries and operated alongside auxiliary cavalry and light infantry. A Roman legionary was equipped with a distinctive set of weapons and armour and fought with combined tactics that used pila (throwing spears) to disrupt enemies before closing in with the gladius.

Roman military organisation extended to permanent fortresses and roads, a professional logistics system and an officer corps that linked military command to imperial politics. Fort layout—rectangular camps with gates, principia (headquarters) and streets—reflected Roman emphasis on order and control. Pay and rewards, retirement benefits and the chance for social advancement made army service an attractive career and a mechanism for Romanisation. The navy played a supporting role in securing sea lanes, transporting troops and engaging in major naval battles.

## Key battles and campaigns: Salamis, Thermopylae, Actium and Trajan’s Dacia
Certain engagements appear repeatedly in the sources because they changed the balance of power and shaped cultural memory. Thermopylae and Salamis together halted Xerxes’ invasion and are often paired in Greek accounts to contrast land and sea warfare and to highlight different city-state responses. Actium (31 BC) marks the decisive confrontation that ended the Roman Republic: Octavian’s fleet under Agrippa defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra, securing Octavian’s path to sole power as Augustus. Coins and reliefs from the period, including the depiction of galleys and standards, are crucial in understanding Roman propaganda and the official telling of events.

Trajan’s campaigns against the Dacians (early second century AD) illustrate Imperial expansion and its presentation. The Dacian wars were celebrated in Rome, most famously on Trajan’s Column, which offers a continuous pictorial narrative of campaign scenes, sieges, river crossings and interactions with Dacian peoples. The column is an essential primary source for how war was commemorated: it emphasises imperial leadership, engineering skill and eventual victory, while also containing vivid images of violence, suffering and the logistical scale of Roman warfare. Studying such monuments helps you balance the official narrative of glory with the human cost of conquest.

## Literature and themes: how ancient authors shape responses to war
Poets and historians shape attitudes to war as much as armies did. The prescribed literary texts for this component present contrasting responses. Passages from Homer’s Iliad show the world of heroic warfare: aristeiai (heroic exploits), personal honour, and the emotional toll of battle. Selections from the Iliad capture both the exhilaration of combat and moments of pathos and reconciliation; Book 24’s meeting of Priam and Achilles, for example, highlights human grief and the possibility of pity even amid war.

Tyrtaeus’ war poetry, written in a Laconic style, offers an Athenian-era Spartan voice that celebrates the fallen warrior and communal courage, ideal for understanding how poetry could be used to encourage and moralise military action. Virgil’s Aeneid Book 2 gives a Roman literary account of the fall of Troy, emphasising the collapse of civic life and the trauma of flight—an example of how epic can represent war’s horror as well as its role in founding myths. Horace’s odes in the Augustan period reflect Roman attitudes to empire, military service and the boundaries of Roman control; poets in this period often shaped an ideal of the soldier-citizen that supported imperial ideology. Across these texts you will explore themes of glory, honour, comradeship, courage, fear, family and the suffering of non-combatants.

## Material culture and visual sources: reading what objects tell us
Artefacts and monuments are central to OCR’s assessment. Objects such as the Bronze Warrior figure and the Corinthian-type helmet dedicated at Olympia offer tangible evidence of arms, armour and dedicatory practices. Naval reliefs and kylixes showing Persians and Greeks fighting, and the south frieze from the Temple of Athena Nike, illustrate how Athenians represented conflict and victory. Roman material culture—from the bronze legionary statuette to coins showing galleys and standards, and monumental sculpture like Trajan’s Column or the relief commemorating Actium—is both documentary and propagandistic. When you study these items, focus on appearance, original context and intended purpose: ask who commissioned the work, what message it was designed to convey, and how different audiences (contemporary viewers, later Roman viewers, modern historians) might interpret it. Comparing literary descriptions with visual evidence is a powerful way to build nuanced arguments.

## Making judgements: comparing sources and assessing reliability
A central skill in this component is to evaluate and compare sources. Literary authors wrote with purposes: Homeric epics entertain and exemplify values; Tyrtaeus exhorts; Virgil frames the past to support Augustan Rome; Horace reflects elite ideology. Similarly, monuments and coins were often produced to communicate power. Always ask what each source wants its audience to think and why it presents events in a particular way. Cross-reference literary accounts with archaeological and art-historical evidence to test claims: for example, use fort plans and legionary equipment to check literary descriptions of Roman tactics, or compare the dramatic language of an epic battle with the more functional details shown on a relief. Where sources conflict, show awareness of bias, genre, audience and date, and explain which features make one account more or less reliable for the question asked.

## Exam technique
Answer the question asked. Begin by quickly planning the structure of your response and noting which sources you will use. For short-answer questions, be precise and factual: name key people, dates and features (for example, describe the hoplite phalanx or the basic layout of a Roman fortress). For longer essays, write a clear introduction that defines the focus and outlines your argument, use paragraphs that each develop a single point with supporting evidence from both literary and material sources, and finish with a conclusion that directly answers the question. Always integrate evidence: when you cite a text or object, explain what it shows and why it matters for your argument. Where comparison is required, make contrasts explicit—how did Spartan training differ from Athenian naval practice, and why did those differences matter in battle? When assessing reliability, consider genre, purpose and audience of the source and whether archaeological context supports or contradicts the narrative. Manage your time so you leave space for a concise conclusion and, where appropriate, a brief evaluation of alternative interpretations. Practise writing answers under timed conditions using the prescribed sources and unseen extracts, and use material culture as well as literary extracts to show that you can integrate the two strands required by the specification.
