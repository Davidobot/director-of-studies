# Close reading of prescribed set texts (GCSE Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What close reading means for this specification
Close reading in OCR GCSE Classical Civilisation asks you to move beyond simply remembering stories and objects: you must show detailed knowledge of texts and material culture, explain how they reflect their social and historical contexts, and judge their meaning and purpose. The exams test two complementary skills. AO1 requires accurate, contextual knowledge of literature and visual/material sources. AO2 asks you to analyse, interpret and evaluate those sources, using evidence to build a clear argument. In practice this means reading a passage or looking closely at an image, identifying what it shows and how it is constructed, and then connecting those observations to the wider culture that produced it and to the possible intentions of the author, artist or patron.

## Reading the set literary texts
When you approach a prescribed passage of Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Euripides, Pliny, Horace, Juvenal or the other set authors, begin by situating the extract in its narrative and cultural context. For narrative poems like the Odyssey and the Iliad you should be able to summarise what has happened immediately before and what will follow, and to explain the passage’s function in the larger plot: does it develop character, advance action, or explore theme? Pay attention to characterisation and relationships. In the Odyssey notice how Odysseus’ guile, his relationship with Athena, and themes of nostos and xenia shape his behaviour in books such as those prescribed. In the Iliad extracts focus on the portrayal of honour, rage and the consequences of violence. For Roman poets look for tone and genre: Horace’s satire is urbane and ironic while Juvenal is invective and moralising; Petronius gives fictionalised, often grotesque sketches of urban life, and Pliny’s letters present personal perspective and social expectations.

Language features matter at GCSE level. Note recurring words, epithets, similes and formulae in Homer, and how speeches convey authority or persuasion. In Latin and Greek literature translated into English you should still be able to point out devices such as vivid imagery, rhetorical questions, emotive language and the use of direct speech. When studying drama or lyric, consider form and performance: Aristophanes’ comic devices and stagecraft, or the dramatic irony and female voice in Euripides’ Medea and Helen. Always link such observations to cultural meaning—what would an ancient audience have understood about heroism, piety, gender or social order from the lines you are analysing?

## Reading visual and material culture
Visual sources require a different kind of close reading but the same critical curiosity. Start with the basic facts you must know: what the object or building is, where it stood, its date and its original function. From there move into description: what is depicted, how are figures arranged, what materials and techniques were used, and what stylistic features are evident? For example, when you examine the Parthenon frieze or the Centauromachy sculpted on the Parthenon, describe the composition, the contrast between order and chaos and how those visual choices communicate Athenian values and political identity. For Roman monuments such as the Ara Pacis or the Prima Porta statue of Augustus, identify how imagery of the imperial family, gods and allegorical figures constructs a message of peace, divine favour and authority.

Ask about audience and context: who commissioned the work and why, and how would its placement (in a temple, forum, tomb or domestic setting) affect its meaning? A temple’s cella and cult statue were active parts of ritual and civic life, while a domestic fresco in Pompeii mediated private identity. Consider technique and survival too: frescoes, mosaics, relief sculpture and architecture have different constraints and affordances; a painted wall can create intimate domestic scenes, whereas a triumphal arch uses scale and narrative relief to celebrate military success. Finally, compare image and text: how does Livy’s account of a foundation myth align with visual representations such as the Aeneid’s scenes on Roman coinage or on Trajan’s Column?

## Making and comparing thematic links between Greece and Rome
The thematic papers require you to make direct comparisons between Greek and Roman sources. Effective comparison rests on selecting clear points of similarity and difference and explaining why they matter. Foundation myths are a rich example. Theseus’ civic role for Athens and the Romulus and Remus story for Rome both assert civic identity, but they do so in different political contexts and with different emphases: Greek myths often highlight local cult and heroism, whereas Roman foundation stories can be harnessed to dynastic or imperial ideology, as in Virgil’s presentation of Aeneas as an ancestor of Rome’s leaders.

Comparisons of gods and religion should contrast cult practice with literary representations. Greek and Roman gods are often recognizable parallels, but their social roles and rituals diverge. Comparing the Parthenon and the Pantheon, or the Homeric Hymn to Demeter with Ovid’s Orpheus episode, helps you show how ideas about the divine, civic identity, ritual and the afterlife changed from polis cults to imperial patronage. When studying women, contrast portrayals such as Medea and Cleopatra with the social realities implied by funerary stelai, the Vestal House, or the evidence of domestic life in Pompeii. Always ask how literary portrayal intersects with material evidence: does art confirm, complicate or contradict the moralising voice of a male author?

## Using historical and cultural context to deepen interpretation
Context is the bridge between observation and explanation. For literature, explain the social or political position of the author and the conventions of the genre. Virgil wrote under Augustus and shaped Roman myth to support the new regime; Ovid’s metamorphoses play with myth for artistic and occasionally subversive ends; Aristophanes wrote comedy that comments on Athenian politics and social anxieties. For material culture, reflect on patronage, public display and function. A public monument like Trajan’s Column both commemorates conquest and constructs an emperor’s image of benevolent leadership; a private house with elaborate frescoes communicates status, taste and identity.

Context also includes ancient audience expectations and reception. A Roman elite reader might respond differently to an image of Cleopatra than an Augustan crowd. Consider legal and social norms where relevant: the status of women in Athens and Rome, the role of slaves and freedmen in urban life, or the Spartan agoge in shaping military identity. Bringing appropriate context into your answer shows AO1 knowledge and strengthens AO2 interpretation because it explains why sources were made and how they would have been understood.

## Combining sources and judging reliability
Examiners expect you to use a range of sources to support an argument, and to show awareness of their limitations. A literary author may be biased by genre, politics or personal motive; an epic poet may dramatise events for effect, while a satirist exaggerates to criticise. Visual sources are selective and shaped by patronage, function and audience. Good close reading therefore balances description with evaluation: state what a source shows, explain how it does so, and then assess how far you can generalise from it.

When you bring sources together, avoid simple aggregation. Use each source to illuminate a particular point and note contradictions or differences in emphasis. For example, you might use Plutarch’s comparison of Theseus and Romulus to discuss civic heroism, then add an inscriptional or archaeological detail to show how public cult or urban topography reinforced a hero’s memory. Where evidence conflicts, suggest why: different genres, occasions, or audiences produce different versions of events. This kind of measured judgement is what teachers look for at higher grades.

## How to prepare and revise effectively
Revision for close reading combines detailed knowledge and practiced analysis. Learn the required passages and objects so you can recall key details quickly, but practise applying analytical questions to new unseen extracts and images. Annotate prescribed literary passages with notes on theme, technique and context; sketch and label visual sources so you can describe them accurately under timed conditions. Practise writing answers that integrate two or more sources, and get comfortable explaining how context affects meaning. Regular feedback from teachers on timed essays will help you refine argument structure, evidence use and evaluative language.

## Exam technique
Manage the paper by understanding its structure. The Thematic paper divides into Greek, Roman and comparative sections, so plan time for two focused short/extended responses and a comparative essay; the Literature and Culture paper requires sustained answers on culture and on literature. Start each answer with a brief orientating sentence that locates the source in context, then move to precise description and quotation or detailed visual description. For AO1 aim to show accurate factual knowledge about the author, date, function and cultural background; for AO2 focus on interpretation, technique, audience and purpose, using evidence to support each point.

When you compare, make the comparison explicit throughout rather than adding it only at the end. Use topic sentences that set out the point you will compare, then treat each source in turn, concluding with an evaluative judgement that weighs their similarities and differences. Keep quotations short and relevant or describe key visual details precisely; the exam rewards targeted use of evidence rather than long quotation. Remember to address the command words: ‘explain’, ‘compare’, ‘assess’ require different balances of description and judgement. Finally, leave a minute at the end of each answer to link back to the question and to add a concise concluding sentence that sums up your argument. This disciplined approach converts detailed close reading into clear, high-scoring exam answers.
