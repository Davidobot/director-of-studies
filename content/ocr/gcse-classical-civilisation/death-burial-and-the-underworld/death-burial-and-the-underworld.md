# Death, burial and the underworld (GCSE Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why this topic matters
Death, burial and beliefs about the underworld were central to ancient Greek and Roman life. Funerary rites expressed family loyalty, social status and religious belief; monuments and grave goods communicated identity and memory; myths about descent and return to the world of the living gave shape to ideas about the soul, the power of the gods and the moral order. For GCSE Classical Civilisation you will need to study both the practices people actually performed and the ways poets and dramatists imagined the afterlife. That means combining literary sources, such as the Homeric Hymn to Demeter and Ovid’s account of Orpheus and Eurydice, with visual and archaeological evidence such as grave stelai, tomb architecture and votive offerings. Understanding the differences between Greek and Roman responses, and the limitations and biases in our sources, is key to making thoughtful comparisons and strong exam answers.

## Beliefs about the soul and the underworld
Ancient Greeks and Romans shared many broad ideas about death but expressed them in different ways. In Greek thought the soul, often called psychē, left the body at death and travelled to the underworld, a shadowy realm beneath the earth ruled by Hades (Pluto to the Romans). The underworld was not a single, uniform place: poets distinguish bleak regions such as Tartarus for the wicked from the Fields of Asphodel for the ordinary dead and Elysium for heroes and the blessed. Rivers such as the Styx and Lethe mark the landscape, and ferrymen like Charon appear in later literary tradition to transport souls. Roman religion adopted and adapted these ideas; Proserpina stands alongside Pluto as a central chthonic deity, and Roman rituals reflect strong concern for the dead as ancestors whose favour or wrath could reach into the present. Belief in restless or malevolent dead is visible in Roman practices such as Lemuria, a festival designed to placate wandering spirits, and in Greek traditions of funerary rites intended to secure safe passage and peaceful rest.

## Greek funerary customs: preparation, procession and commemoration
In ancient Greece the treatment of the corpse and the rites around burial were highly regulated and emotionally charged. The body was washed, anointed and dressed by family members during the prothesis, the ritual laying out of the deceased where relatives kept watch, lamented and prepared the public display of grief. At dawn the ekphora, the funeral procession, carried the body to the burial place; this procession, with its singers, mourners and symbolic displays, was itself a public performance of family status and piety. Burial in a grave or tomb was common, sometimes accompanied by stelai — upright grave markers decorated with relief scenes that could show the deceased at home, in battle, or in affectionate poses. Tombs might receive offerings and garlands at festivals for the dead such as the Genesia, which reinforced ties between the living and their ancestors. Archeological finds support this pattern: grave goods and pottery accompany many burials, emphasizing the belief that the dead needed provisions or commemorative goods and that memory was a practical as well as religious duty. Literary and artistic sources must be read together to reconstruct how different social classes experienced death; the elaborate monuments of the elite tell only part of the story.

## Roman funerary practice: display, clubs and ancestor cult
Roman approaches to death shared some features with the Greeks but developed distinctive institutions. The body was prepared for burial or cremation, and public display of the dead remained important; the funeral procession provided a stage for political and social messages. Elite Romans practised ancestor worship through imagines, wax death masks and elaborate monuments that celebrated family history, while funeral orations could burnish reputation and secure political capital. At the other end of society, burial clubs or collegia funeraticia emerged as practical mutual-aid societies that ensured proper funerals for freedmen and lower-status individuals who could not afford lavish rites. The Roman calendar preserved festivals for the dead: Parentalia was a period of remembrance for family ancestors, while Lemuria involved rites to exorcise harmful spirits. One striking difference from Greek practice is the long-term oscillation between inhumation and cremation in Roman customs; in the late Republic and early Empire cremation was common, with ashes placed in cinerary urns, while inhumation became more frequent later on. Archaeology and inscriptions, such as funerary epitaphs and burial inscriptions from Pompeii and elsewhere, help us reconstruct these variations and the everyday concerns that shaped them.

## Journeys to the underworld in literature: Demeter, Persephone and Orpheus
Myths about descent, loss and return shape how the Greeks and Romans imagined the underworld. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter tells the profoundly human story of Persephone’s abduction by Hades and Demeter’s search for her daughter, a narrative that explains the seasons and models mourning, negotiation with the gods and rites of initiation. The hymn places special emphasis on the agricultural and civic consequences of the divine absence and on the origin of the Eleusinian Mysteries — rituals promising a form of hope beyond death to initiates. In Roman literature Ovid’s telling of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Metamorphoses gives a different tone: Orpheus, the musician whose song softens the hearts of gods and shades, descends to win back his wife but fails when he looks back at the crucial moment. Ovid uses the episode to explore themes of love, loss, human limitation and the power of art. Both myths are rich sources for classroom discussion: they show how the underworld is imagined as a place with rules and inhabitants, and they reveal cultural values about grief, piety and the limits of human agency.

## Monuments, material culture and what it tells us
Material remains are indispensable for studying ancient death. Grave stelai and reliefs capture private moments and social identity in visual terms, while tomb architecture and grave goods indicate wealth, social roles and beliefs about the afterlife. In Greece the funerary stelai often portray the deceased in domestic settings or as warriors, giving a sense of the life they led; in Rome tombs placed along major roads outside the city served as public statements of status and family continuity. Painted tombs such as those preserved in parts of Italy, cinerary urns, and funerary inscriptions add textual and visual detail. Yet archaeological evidence has limits. Materials survive unevenly, so the extravagant monuments of elites dominate the record. Rural or poorer burials leave fewer traces, and the archaeological snapshot cannot always reveal the performative, oral and emotional aspects of funerary ritual recorded in literary sources. The best interpretations combine material and literary evidence, always mindful of provenance, date, and the likely audience for a given object or text.

## Comparing Greek and Roman practice and reading sources critically
When you compare Greek and Roman death practices, consider social context, religious emphasis and the type of source you are using. Both cultures honoured ancestors and used ritual to negotiate the boundary between life and death, but differences emerge in institutions such as the Roman collegia, the Roman emphasis on ancestor masks and public commemoration, and the particulars of festivals like Genesia, Parentalia and Lemuria. Literary sources often dramatise ritual for poetic or political ends: a hymn or myth may explain ritual origins and carry theological meaning but should not be read as an ethnographic manual. Visual sources can be equally selective: a funerary stele commissions an image to project an idealised identity rather than record mundane reality. Always ask who produced a source, for whom, and why; consider whether a text reflects elite practise, popular belief, or the imagination of an author centuries after the custom described.

## Exam technique
In exams you are assessed on two connected skills: precise knowledge of ancient practices and texts, and the ability to analyse and evaluate sources to build a reasoned argument. Start by answering the question directly, making sure your first sentence signals your main point. Use named examples from both Greece and Rome where required, such as the Homeric Hymn to Demeter for Greek religious beliefs and Ovid’s Orpheus for Roman literary portrayal, and describe key rituals such as prothesis and ekphora or Roman funeral clubs and festivals like Parentalia and Lemuria. When you bring in visual or archaeological evidence, identify what the object is, where it originally stood and what it would have communicated to ancient viewers. Avoid unsupported generalisation: instead of saying “they believed in the underworld,” explain how the underworld was portrayed (rivers, regions such as Tartarus and Elysium, ferryman figures) and link that to funerary practice (coins for the ferryman, offerings at the tomb). For comparison questions, organisation matters: make distinct paragraphs for Greek practice, Roman practice and then a direct comparison that highlights similarities and differences, always tying points back to the question. For evaluation, comment on source reliability and audience — for example, argue why a poetic account might exaggerate or why an elite tomb stele might underrepresent poorer practices — and conclude by weighing the evidence to reach a balanced judgement. Manage your time so you can plan, write, and leave a minute at the end to check clarity and to add any short, well-chosen detail that strengthens your argument.
