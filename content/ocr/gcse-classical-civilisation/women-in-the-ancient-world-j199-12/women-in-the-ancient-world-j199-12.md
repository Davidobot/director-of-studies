# Women in the Ancient World (OCR J199/12) (GCSE Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: scope and themes
This component asks you to explore how women were represented, what everyday life could be like for them, and where women could exercise power in ancient Greece and Republican Rome. The focus is mainly on Athens and Republican Rome, but material from Sparta, Pompeii and other communities is used to give a fuller picture. The topic brings together myth and history, literature and objects, asking you to compare Greek and Roman attitudes and to think about what the evidence actually tells us. You will study legendary figures such as Helen and Lucretia alongside real women who appear in literature, law-cases and inscriptions; you will learn about family life, marriage, work and religion; and you will consider exceptional women—warrior figures, courtesans and powerful foreign queens—and how they were represented by ancient writers and artists.

## Sources and how to use them
Successful answers depend on combining literary and visual/material sources and recognising the strengths and limits of each. Drama, poetry, history and letters are often written with an agenda: a playwright like Euripides shapes a character to provoke thought and emotion; Livy and Plutarch interpret early Roman history to teach moral lessons; Catullus and Cicero use invective and rhetoric for personal or political effect. Archaeological objects and monuments—grave stelai, frescoes, statues and domestic contexts—provide direct evidence about appearance, status and ritual use, but they too represent choices about what to show and for whom. Always identify the type of source, its purpose and likely audience, and consider what that means for reliability. For example, a funerary stele like the Hegeso stele presents an idealised image of a woman and her social role, while the House of the Vestal Virgins or Roman legal inscriptions reveal institutional realities. In exams you will be asked to compare Greek and Roman examples: use both kinds of evidence, explain what each source can tell you, and discuss why they might present women differently.

## Women of myth and legend
Mythic women such as Pandora, Helen of Troy, the Sabine Women, Tarpeia and Lucretia play a crucial role in shaping ideas about female virtue, danger and political identity. In Greek myth Pandora is often used to explain the origin of human suffering and to embody anxieties about female curiosity. Helen’s portrayal ranges from a passive beauty to an active cause of war, and studying Euripides’ Helen helps you see how a dramatist can subvert traditional tales. Roman foundation myths use female figures to explain and legitimize the city: the Sabine Women mediate between warring men to secure Rome’s future, Tarpeia is a negative example of treachery, and Lucretia’s rape and suicide become a moral and political catalyst for the overthrow of the monarchy. When you analyse these stories, think about how they were used: did the myth legitimise male authority, justify war, or provide cautionary examples about behaviour? Consider who benefits from each version of a myth and how artistic depictions—on vases, reliefs or public monuments—reinforce the message.

## Young women, marriage customs and household roles
The lives of young women were shaped by education, marriage arrangements and expectations of domesticity, but experiences varied widely between contexts. In Athens girls were primarily educated for their future role in the household; their learning focused on domestic tasks and moral training for marriage. Spartan girls, by contrast, experienced a public education that emphasised physical fitness and produced women who could own property and manage estates. In Rome, many girls received home education and some wealthy families provided broader learning; marriage forms include coemptio, confarreatio and usus, and the legal distinction between marriage cum manu and sine manu affected women’s property rights and legal status. Inside the household, the ideal Athenian wife (kyria) and the Roman matrona were expected to run domestic affairs, bear children and maintain family honour, while slaves performed much of the labour. Archaeological evidence—house layouts, frescoes in Pompeii and funerary stelai—helps reconstruct daily life but must be read alongside legal and literary texts to understand social expectations and lived realities.

## Women outside the respectable ideal: prostitution, courtesans and scandal
Ancient societies made sharp distinctions between respectable wives and women who operated outside that ideal. In Greece, pornai (public prostitutes) and hetairai (companions who could be more educated and influential) fulfilled different social roles and elicited different responses in literature; the symposium context shows how hetairai were represented as partners in conversation as well as sexual companions. In Rome the meretrix and lena appear in invective poetry and legal cases, and figures such as Clodia (often linked with Catullus’ Lesbia) are remembered through hostile male testimony. Court speeches like Cicero’s Pro Caelio use accusations about sexual behaviour to destroy reputations, so you must treat such sources with caution: they are rhetorical and often exaggerated. The stories of individuals such as Neaira and Aspasia let you discuss how women could navigate public life, use relationships for influence, and become the focus of political and moral debate.

## Women and religion
Religious roles could offer women genuine public authority and visibility. Priestesses and prophetesses feature in both Greece and Rome: the Pythia at Delphi acted as a state oracle, and Roman Vestal Virgins held unique privileges and responsibilities in maintaining Rome’s sacred fire. The Vestals enjoyed legal privileges and public prominence, but also faced severe punishment for breaches of chastity. Female ritual roles extended to state festivals: Greek women took part in the Thesmophoria and the Panathenaia, and Roman cults such as the Bona Dea involved women in exclusive rites. The Flaminica Dialis, as the wife of the Flamen Dialis, had ritual taboos reflecting how religion could both empower and constrain. Visual evidence—statues, reliefs and temple contexts—reveals how religious women were represented, while literary sources explain their civic importance and the moral expectations attached to their roles.

## Power, politics and exceptional women
Although formal political institutions in Athens and Rome excluded most women, women could and did influence politics in indirect and sometimes direct ways. In Athens women were barred from the Assembly, yet comic drama like Aristophanes’ Assemblywomen imagines women seizing public power and satirises male anxieties about political change. Roman women, though excluded from the Senate, could exercise influence through family networks, patronage and public benefaction; campaigns such as the repeal of the Oppian Law illustrate collective female action in Rome. Individual women could be both idealised and vilified: Sempronia is named in Sallust’s account of the Catilinarian conspiracy, and the Laudatio Turiae gives a rare female voice in a funerary inscription that praises a woman’s loyalty and legal skill. The stories of Agnodice and the Assemblywomen allow you to ask about the boundaries of women’s authority, how those limits were policed, and how literature records both real incidents and wishful thinking.

## Foreign and warrior women: Medea, Amazons, Camilla and Cleopatra
Foreign or warrior women often embody cultural fears about female agency and foreign threat. Medea, as presented by Euripides, is a complex figure whose intelligence and vengeance challenge Greek patriarchy; her story encourages sympathy even as it depicts transgressive violence. The Amazons and Penthesilea provide models of female martial prowess in Greek art and epic, used to define male heroism by contrast. In Roman epic, Camilla in Virgil’s Aeneid is admired as a swift warrior but her death restores Roman masculinity. Cleopatra VII is a paradigmatic example of how a powerful foreign queen was portrayed in Roman sources: Roman poets and historians emphasise her sexuality and political threat, often obscuring her skills as ruler. When you study these figures, consider how cultural anxieties about gender, ethnicity and power shape their portrayal and how modern readers can distinguish between propaganda and plausible historical detail.

## Interpreting evidence and making comparisons
Comparative questions are central to this component. When you compare Greek and Roman examples, do more than list differences: explain how social structures, legal frameworks and religious institutions shaped women’s lives. Use prescribed literary passages—Aristophanes’ Assemblywomen, Euripides’ Medea and Helen, Livy’s account of Lucretia, Virgil’s passages about Camilla—and pair them with visual sources such as the Hegeso stele, the Flight of Medea krater, the Parthenon and Bassae friezes, frescoes from Pompeii and the House of the Vestal Virgins. Always address context: date, genre, intended audience and purpose. A funeral stele presents an ideal, a comic play mocks, and a historian may moralise; synthesise these perspectives to reach a balanced judgement about what the evidence suggests and where it is silent or biased.

## Exam technique
In the exam, read the question carefully and identify whether it asks for knowledge (AO1), analysis (AO2) or a combination. Begin answers with a short direct response to the question, then support it with specific evidence from both literary and visual/material sources. Where the question asks for comparison, make sure you treat both Greek and Roman examples and make explicit links between them rather than discussing them separately without comparison. When you use a prescribed source, identify its type (play, inscription, vase, statue), its purpose and its likely audience, and explain how those factors affect its reliability. For unseen sources, describe what you can directly observe and place the item in its broader cultural context before using it to support an argument. For longer essays, organise your response into clear paragraphs that each make a point, provide evidence and evaluate that evidence; end with a brief conclusion that answers the question and reflects on the balance of evidence. Remember that examiners reward precise factual knowledge, close analysis of sources, and a thoughtful evaluation of how and why ancient representations of women were constructed.
