# Myth and Religion (OCR J199/11) (GCSE Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview and purpose of the topic
Myth and Religion is the thematic study that asks you to investigate how ancient Greeks and Romans understood the world, expressed power and identity, and organised everyday life through stories, rituals and built environments. The topic covers a wide chronological range but focuses on material and literary evidence that has survived for us to study: temple architecture and sculpture, festival practice and sacrificial rites, foundation myths and heroic legends, funeral customs and beliefs about the underworld. You will learn to use both literary texts and visual or material culture together to form balanced, evidence-based arguments. The course is designed so that you make direct comparisons between Greek and Roman practice and consider why differences exist, what they meant to people at the time, and how later audiences interpreted those practices.

## What you will study and how to approach sources
In Myth and Religion you will study major gods and their attributes, foundation stories for Athens and Rome, the figure of Heracles/Hercules, festivals and sanctuaries, the role of temples and priests, death and burial practices, and myths of the underworld such as the Homeric Hymn to Demeter and Ovid’s account of Orpheus. The specification expects familiarity with a set of prescribed literary and visual sources and with the idea that sources were produced for particular audiences with particular aims. When you study each source, pay attention to what it shows about appearance, function, style and original setting, and think about why the author or artist chose to present things in a particular way. Always ask whose voice you are reading or looking at, whether the source is official or private, and how later viewers or readers might have reused the same imagery or tale for political or religious purposes.

## Gods, heroes and foundation myths
The Greek and Roman pantheons overlap but were embedded in different social and civic structures. In Greece, Zeus, Hera, Demeter, Poseidon, Hephaistos, Apollo, Artemis, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysos, Hestia, Hermes and Hades appear in myths and are visualised in sculpture, vase-painting and monumental architecture. The Romans adopted many of these deities under Latin names: Jupiter, Juno, Ceres, Neptune, Vulcan, Apollo, Diana, Minerva, Venus, Mars and Pluto, and they also emphasised specific priesthoods and cults that reflected Roman civic priorities. Heroes and foundation myths played a key role in defining civic identity. The Athenians told of a contest between Poseidon and Athena for the naming of Athens and celebrated the deeds of Theseus, while Romans traced their origins through Aeneas, Alba Longa and the twin founders Romulus and Remus. Heracles in Greece and Hercules in Rome functioned as a bridge between myth and civic cult: in Greek contexts he could be linked to the origins of the Olympic Games and the labours pictured on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, while Ovid and Virgil adapt his adventures to underscore Roman values, for example by associating Hercules with protection of the city and with episodes such as his confrontation with Cacus.

## Temples, sacrifice and festival life
Temples and sanctuaries give us direct evidence for how religion was woven into public life. In Greece, the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia provide contrasting examples of pan-Hellenic and civic expression. The temple usually housed an inner chamber with a cult statue, while altars positioned outside allowed worshippers to observe sacrifices. Priests and priestesses, and specialised religious figures such as prophets, carried out rituals that ranged from animal sacrifice to libations and dedications. In Rome, buildings such as the Pantheon and the Temple of Fortuna Virilis show a continuous engagement with monumental architecture; priestly colleges like the Pontiffs and the Vestal Virgins managed civic rites, augurs read omens and haruspices inspected entrails. Festivals bound communities together: in Athens the Great Panathenaia and the City Dionysia combined processions, competitions and theatrical performance; in Rome the Lupercalia and Saturnalia brought religious observance together with social spectacle. When studying festivals and temples, consider both practical details—who performed a ritual, where and when—and the symbolic messages that the festival or temple aimed to communicate about the polis or the empire.

## Death, burial and journeys to the underworld
Ideas about death reveal a great deal about cultural values. Greek funeral practice included preparation of the body, the prothesis display, an ekphora procession to the gravesite, and the use of stelai to commemorate the dead; rituals such as Genesia remembered ancestors. Romans observed similar practices, but their calendar also included family festivals such as the Parentalia and public rites like the Lemuria. Archaeology from cemeteries, tombs and grave goods—such as stelai, painted sarcophagi or the riches from Mycenaean shaft graves—offers tangible evidence for beliefs and status. Myths about journeys to the underworld, such as the Homeric Hymn to Demeter’s account of Persephone or Ovid’s story of Orpheus and Eurydice, allow you to compare literary portrayals of death and its meanings. These stories give insight into how grief, loss and the possibility of return or transformation were imagined, and they also show how different genres and authors shaped the emotional impact of a myth for their audience.

## Visual and literary case studies: how to read them together
The specification makes clear that you must use both literature and material culture to support judgments, so learning to read images as carefully as words is essential. Statues such as the Augustus of Prima Porta and monuments like the Ara Pacis demonstrate how mythic imagery could be harnessed to express imperial ideology, linking Augustus to divine ancestry and to a narrative of restored peace. Vase paintings, gravestones and temple friezes present condensed stories and symbolic gestures; the Centauromachy and Amazonomachy sculpted on the Parthenon and on the Bassae frieze show how myth was used to express civic triumph over chaos and foreignness. Literary texts in the prescribed list include the Homeric Hymns, episodes from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, selected passages from Livy and Virgil, and in some cases dramatic or satirical treatment of myth. When you prepare for the exam, practise moving from description to interpretation: identify what the source shows, explain what that detail meant to its original audience, and then consider alternative readings. For instance, compare how a Roman monument and a Greek temple relief might both depict a heroic scene but use it to endorse different political claims.

## Making comparisons between Greece and Rome
A central requirement of the course is comparative analysis. Greece and Rome shared many stories and images but adopted and adapted them in ways that reflected different political structures, social priorities and historical experiences. Where Greek art might emphasise civic freedom, competition and pan-Hellenic religious festivals, Roman monuments often foregrounded dynastic succession, public benefaction and the emperor’s role as guarantor of order. When you compare, do not simply list differences: explain how each difference follows from a social or political context. For example, the prominence of the Vestal Virgins in Rome can be linked to Roman concerns about household and state purity and to the legal position of women in relation to property and sanction. Equally, the Athenian celebration of Theseus links leadership to the idea of a civic champion whose myth underwrites communal institutions. Use specific examples from the prescribed sources—the Parthenon friezes, the Pantheon’s architectural program, Livy’s foundation narrative or the Homeric Hymn—to support your analysis and to show how meanings change with context.

## Exam technique
Success in the Myth and Religion paper depends on combining accurate factual knowledge with balanced evaluation of sources. Start by reading each question carefully and underline the task words: do you need to describe, explain, compare, or evaluate? Manage your time so that you allocate enough minutes to longer, synoptic questions that ask you to use both literary and visual material. Remember the two assessment objectives: AO1 rewards knowledge and contextual understanding, so show you know the prescribed texts and monuments and what they meant in their original contexts; AO2 rewards analysis and evaluation, so go beyond description and explain why a source presents events in a certain way, what its biases might be, and how it might be read differently by ancient and modern audiences. For source-based questions, always begin with a clear description of the source’s content and features, then move to interpretation and, where relevant, comparison. When asked to compare a Greek and Roman example, frame your answer around a short thesis that identifies the main point of comparison, then support it with two or three focused, evidence-backed paragraphs that draw on both literature and material culture. Use specific names, titles and locations—such as the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, the Parthenon, the Pantheon, Ovid’s Orpheus, or the Ara Pacis—to demonstrate AO1 knowledge, and follow that detail with analysis about purpose, audience and historical context for AO2 marks. For extended responses, plan a brief structure before you write: an introduction that answers the question directly, two to three development paragraphs that compare and analyse evidence, and a concluding paragraph that summarises your judgment. Practise writing concise, reasoned conclusions that reflect the evidence you have discussed. Finally, use past question practice to familiarise yourself with the balance of short and long questions, and always check that you have answered every part of the question asked.
