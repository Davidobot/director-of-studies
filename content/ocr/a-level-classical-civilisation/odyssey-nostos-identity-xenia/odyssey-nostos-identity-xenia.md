# Odyssey: Nostos, Identity and Xenia (A-level Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: the Odyssey’s concerns and structure
Homer’s Odyssey is fundamentally a poem about return: the nostos, or homecoming, of Odysseus. Yet that return is not only a physical voyage across the Mediterranean; it is an ethical and social journey in which identities are tested, hospitality is judged, and social order must be restored. The poem’s structure—beginning in medias res, interrupting the action with Odysseus’ own first‑person account, and alternating scenes in Ithaca and on the voyage—means themes interlock. The reader moves between the public sphere of the palace and the private experiences of a man who is “many‑wiled” and mutable. Understanding nostos, identity and xenia together gives a coherent route into the poem: nostos gives the narrative aim, identity supplies the problem to be resolved, and xenia provides the social code against which characters are judged.

## Nostos: layers of homecoming
Nostos in the Odyssey is a complex ideal. At one level it means the sailor’s safe return to his homeland; at another it involves recovery of status and household order. For Odysseus nostos requires not just arrival at Ithaca but recognition by family, re‑establishment of household authority and the reassertion of social norms. Homer contrasts different kinds of return: the successful, ritualised hospitality extended by the Phaeacians leads to prompt repatriation and generous gifts; the destructive “homecomings” of other heroes or enemies reveal the poem’s moral stakes. Nostos is also psychological: Odysseus must remember who he is (and the audience learns about his past through his own narratives) and his household must remember and accept him. Telemachus experiences a parallel nostos in his journey from boyhood to manhood, returning with new confidence to play a role in restoring the household. The poem thus treats nostos as both personal fulfilment and political repair.

## Identity and disguise: fluid selves and recognition
Identity in the Odyssey is unstable and performative. Odysseus is repeatedly described as polymetis or polytropos—resourceful, versatile, “many‑wiled”—and his mastery of disguise and deception is central to his character. He tells the Cyclops that his name is “Nobody,” he invents stories, and he appears to his wife in rags. Disguise serves several functions: survival in hostile situations, strategic testing of others, and finally the recovery of identity through recognition scenes. Homer stages identity as something that can be confirmed by physical proof (the scar on Odysseus’ thigh revealed to Eurycleia), by domestic knowledge (Penelope’s test of the secret of the bed), and by behaviour. Recognition scenes are powerful because they resolve doubt: they reunite the man with his social world, allowing nostos to be completed. Yet the poet deliberately complicates sympathy for Odysseus by showing how his cunning can be morally ambiguous; his capacity for trickery raises questions about the ethics of deceit when deployed for patriotic ends.

## Xenia: the social code and its violations
Xenia, the ritualised laws of guest‑friendship, is one of the poem’s organising principles. It governs the exchange between host and guest: a stranger receives food, washing, entertainment and a safe stay; the guest reciprocates with respect and, ideally, a return gift or later assistance. In the Homeric world xenia is sanctioned by Zeus, the protector of guests, so breaches have religious as well as social consequences. The Odyssey sets up a range of xenia examples to teach and to test. The Phaeacians embody idealised xenia, rescuing and conveying Odysseus home; their actions show how hospitality promotes order and community. By contrast, the Cyclops violates xenia spectacularly by eating guests, an act that invites divine punishment. The suitors in Ithaca pervert xenia: they overstay, consume the household’s resources, and plot to marry Penelope. Their behaviour is the social problem Odysseus must solve. Other episodes complicate the pattern: Circe and Calypso provide shelter but also detain Odysseus; is their hospitality genuine when it compromises nostos? xenia thus becomes a tool for examining moral and cultural boundaries.

## Close reading of key episodes: how the themes play out
Certain episodes are especially instructive. Odysseus’ encounter with Polyphemus (Book 9) juxtaposes cunning with moral cost. The hero’s bluff of the name “Nobody” and his escape by blinding the Cyclops demonstrate metis, but the subsequent taunting and the boast to reveal his identity bring Poseidon’s curse—here identity and pride have long‑term consequences for nostos. Circe (Book 10) is a reversal of the Cyclopean scene: she initially transforms men into animals, yet then becomes host and adviser, offering both hospitality and practical help for the journey home, including directions to the Underworld. The visit to the Underworld (Book 11) is a moral and prophetic moment: Odysseus hears from shades about the fate of others and is warned about the cattle of Helios, a temptation that will test the crew’s discipline. The Phaeacian episodes (Books 6–8) show hospitable ritual at its best: games, feasting and the provision of ships and gifts mark civic generosity. Finally, the return to Ithaca (Books 13–24) stages tests and recognitions. Athena’s disguises enable a gradual unmasking, and the bed test provides an indelible symbol of marital knowledge and fidelity. The slaughter of the suitors raises questions about justice: restoration of household order is violent and absolute. Close attention to language and plot choices in these episodes exposes how Homer manipulates sympathy, ambiguity and moral evaluation.

## Literary techniques and oral context: how Homer shapes these themes
Homer’s artistry—his use of epithets, formulaic phrases, extended similes and established plot sequences—supports the poem’s treatment of nostos, identity and xenia. Opening the narrative in medias res creates suspense about Odysseus’ fate and allows the poet to interweave present action with narrative flashbacks, framing Odysseus as both actor and narrator. The poet’s use of repeated motifs—boasts, guest‑friendship rituals, tests of recognition—gives the audience patterns to compare, so that ethical and social contrasts become visible. The oral tradition that produced the Odyssey relied on mnemonic formulas; these shape character portrayal but also permit improvisation, enabling a complex hero who acts both within and against traditional heroic expectations. Similes, often drawn from pastoral or martial life, underline emotional states and moral judgements: the domestic simile, for instance, often accompanies scenes of reunion to emphasise intimacy and social repair.

## Characters as embodiments and critiques of values
Key characters function as embodiments or problematizations of Homeric values. Odysseus is both model and critique: he is praised for cleverness and condemned when his cunning borders on selfishness or arrogance. Penelope represents fidelity and cleverness of another kind—her weaving and unravelling of the shroud and the final bed test position her as guardian of the household’s integrity. Telemachus is a formative figure whose maturation from uncertain youth into a partner in vengeance parallels the restoration of the house. Athena embodies divine endorsement of Odysseus and the values he represents; her interventions show how nostos and justice align with divine will. By contrast, the suitors are a concentrated image of civic decline, their abuse of xenia signalling collapse of social order. Even secondary figures complicate simple moral readings: are Calypso and Circe benevolent captors or dangerous detainers? Are the Phaeacians blameless benefactors or indulgent of a culture of sailing that might be politically suspect? Character study helps the student weigh Homeric values against ethical ambiguity.

## Teaching and contextual clarification
When approaching the Odyssey for A‑level study, it is important to contextualise the poem within late Bronze Age memory, Archaic Greek oral tradition and the social realities of the archaic polis. Explain to students that Homeric social codes—like xenia and the importance of household authority—reflect values essential to a society before centralized legal systems fully enforced norms. Encourage students to track recurrent motifs and to compare episodes to show patterns: for example, compare the Cyclops, Phaeacian, and suitor scenes to demonstrate contrasting models of hospitality. Remind students to consider voice and perspective: Odysseus’ own narrative voice in Books 9–12 colours events with self‑presentation and selective emphasis, whereas the external narrative sometimes invites ironic or critical distance. Finally, link the poem’s ethical questions to later literary responses and to debates about leadership, justice and homecoming, so students appreciate the Odyssey’s ongoing cultural resonance.

## Exam technique
Respondents should combine close textual detail with awareness of the historical and cultural contexts that shaped the Odyssey’s values. In source‑based questions begin with a brief identification of the passage’s context and then proceed to analyse language, imagery and dramatic function: draw attention to key moments of characterization, narrative voice and the ways the episode illustrates nostos, identity or xenia. When writing essays balance argument and evidence: make a clear thesis, support it with well‑chosen episodes (naming book numbers where helpful), and consider alternative readings—Homer often invites ambiguous moral judgements, and examiners reward candidates who acknowledge complexity. Use comparisons across episodes to demonstrate synoptic understanding; for example, use Polyphemus, the Phaeacians and the suitors to show how hospitality functions as both religious duty and social stabiliser. Finally, integrate scholarly perspectives if you know them, but do so sparingly and to support an argument rather than substitute for textual analysis. Time management matters: allocate time to plan, write structured paragraphs, and leave a few minutes to check that quotations and references are accurate and that the conclusion returns to the question.
