# Democracy and the Athenians: Solon, Cleisthenes and Pericles (A-level Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what Athenian democracy looked like and why it matters
Athenian democracy was not a single blueprint but an evolving set of institutions, practices and cultural habits that together produced a distinctive political culture in the city of Athens. It matters because many of the ideas we associate with popular government — rule by large public assemblies, accountability of magistrates, and the idea that ordinary citizens could take part directly in decision-making — were practised in Athens in the 6th and 5th centuries BC in ways that shaped Greek political thought and later Western political theory. Importantly, Athenian democracy was limited: only adult male citizens had full political rights, and women, slaves and resident foreigners were excluded. Yet within those limits the Athenians developed mechanisms intended to prevent domination by a single group or individual and to integrate a diverse population into the life of the city. Understanding the long, contested process that produced that system—especially the contributions of Solon, Cleisthenes and Pericles—helps explain both the strengths and the tensions of Athenian political life.

## Solon: crisis, compromise and the foundations of reform
Solon (early 6th century BC) is remembered as a lawgiver who responded to social and economic crisis with reforms designed to stabilise Athens by balancing competing interests. The city faced deep indebtedness, the concentration of land and political power in aristocratic hands, and threats of internal violence. Solon’s measures combined social relief and institutional change. His most famous reform, the seisachtheia, cancelled debts and forbade debt-slavery, immediately addressing the most volatile grievance. He reorganised citizens into property classes with different political roles and military obligations, creating a system that linked economic capacity to political participation without returning to hereditary oligarchy. Solon is also credited with judicial and legal reforms: he revised Draco’s harsh homicide and public order laws, promoted timelier adjudication, and is associated with the early development of appeal and more public forms of justice.

Solon’s significance lies less in inventing democracy than in creating flexibility and space for political participation. His reforms curtailed the worst abuses of aristocratic dominance, widened citizen involvement, and introduced principles — clearer laws, greater public accountability, and representation by property class — that later reforms would build on. For teaching, it helps to emphasise Solon’s role as a mediator: his laws were compromises meant to prevent civil war rather than to realise a single ideological programme. Sources about Solon are late and often ideological, so treat narratives that make him the sole architect of democratic Athens with caution.

## Cleisthenes and the redefinition of political identity
Cleisthenes (late 6th century BC) is often credited with the structural reorganisation that turned Athens from a collection of powerful families and local factions into a polity where many citizens had a stake in public life. His key innovations were the creation of new demes (local units), the reorganisation of citizens into new tribes that cut across old family and regional loyalties, and the institution of the Council of 500 (the Boule) chosen by lot from these tribes. This redivision diluted aristocratic power based on kinship and locality, giving ordinary citizens new channels to participate in political administration.

Two features of Cleisthenes’ changes deserve particular attention. First, sortition — the use of lot to select many public officials — became a defining technique: it embodied the idea that offices should be accessible and that selection should not be monopolised by elites. Second, the demes created new local identities that fed into the city-wide political system; citizens now thought of themselves not only as members of families but as members of demes with civic responsibilities. The institution of ostracism, probably introduced in the years after Cleisthenes, provided a non-violent mechanism to exile a perceived threat to the constitution, though it was used sparingly.

Cleisthenes’ reforms therefore did not create democracy in full but redistributed political opportunity and made the polis a political community whose members were linked by institutions rather than only by birth. When teaching Cleisthenes, emphasise how reorganisation of administrative units can change political culture: Cleisthenes gave Athens the institutional vocabulary that later democratic innovations could use.

## Pericles, Ephialtes and the mid‑5th century deepening of democracy
The mid-5th century BC saw further, more radical moves towards popular government, with Ephialtes and Pericles as the most prominent reformers. Ephialtes reduced the powers of the Areopagus, the conservative council of ex-archons that had long dominated Athenian political life; his reforms transferred many of those judicial and supervisory responsibilities to the people’s courts and the Boule. This weakened aristocratic oversight and strengthened institutions controlled by a wider body of citizens.

Pericles, who dominated Athenian public life in the decades before the Peloponnesian War, consolidated and extended democratic practices. Under Pericles the Assembly (Ekklesia) became the central forum for major decisions, including declarations of war, treaties and laws; public office-holding expanded, and crucially, payment for jury service and for certain public duties was introduced. Payment was transformative because it enabled poorer citizens to participate in political life without losing livelihood: the claim that democracy under Pericles became ‘the rule of the poor’ should be seen in light of these measures to widen participation. Pericles’ leadership and his public building programme — which reshaped the Athenian landscape and civic identity — also helped create a sense of collective Athenian greatness. He is often credited with a civic rhetoric that fused pride, superiority and the ideal of active citizenship.

Pericles’ influence is visible in Thucydides’ portrait of the Athenian empire and the famous Funeral Oration attributed to him, which celebrates the equal rights of citizens and the city’s cultural achievements. Yet Periclean Athens also presents tensions: an imperial policy abroad that gathered wealth and power for Athens, and aggressive politics at home that could encourage demagogy. Teaching this period benefits from balancing Pericles’ democratic achievements with the costs and contradictions of empire and charismatic leadership.

## Institutions in practice: Assembly, Boule, courts, sortition, payment and citizenship
The Athenian political system worked through a set of interlocking institutions. The Assembly met regularly and was the sovereign decision-making body; speech and persuasion mattered, so rhetorical skill had civic value. The Boule of 500 prepared business for the Assembly and oversaw daily administration; it was drawn by lot and rotated membership to prevent accumulation of power. The law courts — large juries chosen by lot — acted as both judges and executors of political will, creating accountability through trial and punishment.

Sortition, or selection by lot, appears repeatedly as a mechanism designed to prevent corruption and concentration of office. It underpinned the Boule, many magistracies and the juries, and reflected a belief that ordinary citizens, when mixed and brought together, could govern fairly. Payment for public duties — jury pay and other compensations — made participation realistic for the poor and therefore widened the citizen base. Ostracism, jury oversight, and the principle that magistrates could be held to account at the end of their term were all means of checking abuse.

Yet institutions could be manipulated. Demagogues exploited mass assemblies and the courts, and imperial revenues sometimes skewed local politics. Citizenship laws, increasingly restrictive in the late 5th century, remind us that the concept of the citizen itself was contested and could be narrowed as well as widened. When preparing students, it is useful to trace how institutions were intended to work and how real politics sometimes subverted those intentions: the contrast between constitutional ideals and political practice provides rich material for analysis.

## Sources, interpretation and classroom approaches
The surviving evidence for Athenian democracy comes in mixed genres: historical narrators, playwrights, political speeches, inscriptions and later philosophical critiques. Each kind of source has strengths and limitations. Thucydides offers a reflective, sometimes idealising account of events and leaders; his depiction of Pericles’ policies and rhetoric is invaluable but shaped by Thucydides’ own analytical aims. Aristophanes’ comedies are satirical and aimed at entertainment, yet they reveal contemporary anxieties about leaders, the people, and democratic practice. The Old Oligarch (Pseudo-Xenophon) presents a sharp, cynical critique of democracy from an aristocratic viewpoint; Plato’s Republic offers a philosophical attack on rule by the many. Tragic plays and legal speeches show how ideas of justice, citizenship and the role of law were debated in public culture.

In teaching, emphasise source evaluation: who composed the text, for what audience, and with what purpose? Encourage students to compare different kinds of evidence — for example, to contrast Aristophanes’ comic portrayal of demagogues with Thucydides’ political analysis and the procedural details preserved in inscriptions or legal speeches. Use case studies: Solon’s reforms as presented in later historians, the law-court evidence for trials, or Pericles’ Funeral Oration as a rhetorical manifesto. Make sure students practise weighing biased literary portrayals against institutional evidence and archaeological material. Secondary modern scholarship can help frame these debates and offer interpretations to test against primary material; recommended authors include accessible historians of Greek democracy who outline both the achievements and limitations of Athenian institutions.

## Exam technique
When answering examination questions on Solon, Cleisthenes and Pericles, begin by making clear definitions: define the term democracy as the Athenians understood it, and specify dates or the institutional context you will use. For source-based questions, always comment on provenance and purpose before using the material as evidence: identify the genre (history, comedy, speech, law), the likely audience, and how that shapes the content. In essays, structure your argument thematically or chronologically, use specific examples (for example, seisachtheia, the Boule of 500, payment for jury service, Ephialtes’ curtailment of the Areopagus), and explain significance: not just what happened but why it mattered for democratic development.

Balance is crucial: show understanding of reformers’ intentions and achievements but also of limits and consequences. When asked to assess a statement (e.g. ‘Solon laid the foundations of Athenian democracy’), weigh supporting and opposing evidence and reach a reasoned judgement. Use secondary scholarly views sparingly and critically to support your points if the question invites wider reading; examiners reward engagement with interpretation rather than mere quotation. Time management is essential: allocate time to plan, write and revise, and in long essays signpost your argument so the examiner can follow your line of reasoning. Finally, practice applying these techniques to the prescribed sources used in the specification — Thucydides, Aristophanes, the Old Oligarch and the tragedy extracts — so you can deploy them fluently in the exam.
