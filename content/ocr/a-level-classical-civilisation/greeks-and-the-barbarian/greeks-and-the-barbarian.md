# Greeks and the 'Barbarian': Herodotus, Aeschylus and Art (A-level Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why this topic matters for A-level Classical Civilisation
The theme of the “barbarian” sits at the intersection of literature, history and material culture, and it is therefore an ideal focus for the OCR A‑Level that asks you to combine textual and visual evidence with classical thought. At its simplest the word barbarian marks linguistic difference — Greeks heard non‑Greek speech as “bar‑bar” — but at the level of ideology it becomes a powerful way for Greeks to define themselves. The study brings together core skills from the specification: close reading of texts in translation, interpretation of visual and archaeological sources, and measured evaluation of ancient ideas and their contexts. It also connects immediately with enduring modern questions about identity, stereotyping and cultural encounter, so the material is both accessible and intellectually demanding for students preparing for the H408 exams.

## Greek identity and the invention of the ‘barbarian’
The Greek world in the Archaic and Classical periods was not a single nation but a patchwork of independent city‑states. Shared language, religious festivals and mythic traditions created a sense of cultural kinship, yet the poleis were politically autonomous and often in conflict. The idea of the barbarian emerged in this context as a rhetorical and cultural boundary: someone who did not speak Greek, whose customs were different and therefore liable to moral judgment. The Persian Wars (early 5th century BC) were a decisive moment. Military confrontation with the vast Achaemenid Empire crystallised Greek self‑image in opposition to a foreign monarchical power. Victory and defeat stories alike were woven into drama, historiography and visual arts. As you study this component, it is helpful to keep in mind that “barbarian” could mean enemy, exotic other, threat, or even object of curiosity and admiration; the Greeks used the term in many registers and at times contradicted themselves.

## Herodotus: inquiry, ethnography and narrative bias
Herodotus remains central to the topic because his Histories offer one of the most detailed ancient narratives of Greek–Persian encounters. He labels himself an investigator and includes ethnographic sketches, speeches, and anecdote as part of a broader inquiry into why the East and West clashed. Herodotus displays a mixture of admiration and Greek prejudice: he can marvel at Persian administrative organisation, the palaces of Persepolis and Persian customs, and yet he is also capable of portraying Persian empire and monarchic ambition as threatening to Greek freedoms. His narrative techniques — use of oracles, stories about Xerxes, and inclusion of supernatural motifs — are rhetorical tools that shape how an audience should respond. For examination work you should be prepared to discuss how Herodotus constructs his characters, how far his narrative reflects Greek anxieties, and what evidence his account offers about Persian society. Crucially, assess Herodotus’s reliability: his aims are not modern objectivity but the weaving of a meaningful narrative, so his cultural descriptions need to be read with attention to context, rhetorical purpose and the performative expectations of his original listeners.

## Aeschylus’ Persians: tragedy, perspective and public memory
Aeschylus’ Persians is unique among surviving Greek tragedies because it dramatizes a very recent historical disaster from the Persian point of view. The play stages the Persian court’s grief after Salamis; the chorus of Persian elders and the unambiguous evocation of Xerxes’ hubris create an unusual dramatic posture in which the Greek audience is invited into a space of pity for the defeated enemy. The play remains useful for classroom discussion because it shows how drama functioned in Athens as public performance, shaped by religious festival and civic memory. It also demonstrates how theatrical devices — chorus, messenger speeches, onstage representations of loss — can influence an audience’s reading of events. In teaching this play, emphasise how Aeschylus uses the conventions of tragedy to moralize about imperial overreach, and how the dramatist’s choices reflect contemporary Athenian attitudes: victory celebrated at the civic level but also an awareness of the human cost of war. Comparing Aeschylus’ portrayal of Persians with Herodotus’ gives a productive tension between poetic dramatization and historiographical narrative.

## Art and material culture: visualising the ‘other’
Visual sources are indispensable for understanding how Greeks and Persians saw one another. Vase‑painting, temple friezes and tomb reliefs encode conventions for representing foreigners: patterned trousers, caps, and beards often marked Persians in Greek iconography, while Persians in their own reliefs appear as idealised, multiethnic subjects bringing tribute. The Parthenon and the frieze of the Temple of Athena Nike offer Greek visual narratives of the Persian Wars, while Athenian vases such as the kylix attributed to the Triptolemos Painter show encounters between Greeks and Persians on a domestic scale. On the Persian side, the monumental reliefs at Persepolis, the Gate of All Nations and the stair reliefs of the Apadana present a multiethnic empire in formal procession, asserting imperial order rather than barbarian chaos. Finds such as the Oxus Treasure and the Cyrus Cylinder testify to a sophisticated imperial culture and political ideology that complicate Greek stereotypical portraits. When you interpret material culture in essays or commentaries, attend to details of style, original function and findspot; consider what a votive amphora, a funerary relief or a royal inscription might have been intended to convey to contemporary viewers.

## Female barbarians: Amazons, Medea and the politics of otherness
Greeks were fascinated and alarmed by female figures who crossed normative gender and cultural boundaries. The Amazons and the figure of Medea are central case studies. Vase scenes and sculptural reliefs repeatedly show the Amazon as an exotic, martial inversion of Greek female roles; she is an embodiment of disorder that must be contained by heroic action. Medea, as Euripides portrays her, is both a sympathetic tragic figure and a threatening foreign woman who disrupts civic and domestic norms by murdering her children. Euripides’ Medea and the material culture depicting Amazons illuminate Greek anxieties about foreignness interwoven with gender. For A‑level responses, explore how the status of these women as “barbarian” amplifies fears about social boundaries, and how dramatists use that status to probe questions of justice, revenge and citizenship. Note too that Greek audiences may have had complex responses: fascination with the exotic could coexist with moral censure.

## Working with sources: reliability, context and comparison
A‑level success depends on a rigorous approach to sources. Always place a text or artefact in its social, political and performative context. Ask who produced it, for what audience, and what assumptions they shared. For Herodotus, consider his aims as an inquirer and storyteller; for Aeschylus, consider the festival setting and the expectations of an Athenian audience. For vases and reliefs, consider original placement and function: a krater used at a symposium has different intentions from a public frieze. Use triangulation: compare literary accounts with visual evidence and archaeological data to test or nuance an interpretation. Be mindful of anachronistic judgment; while modern parallels can help explain why the topic matters, your primary focus must be the ancient sources and how contemporaries would have understood them. In longer essays, bring in scholarly interpretations to support or challenge your reading, but always anchor argumentation in close analysis of the prescribed ancient material.

## Exam technique
When approaching OCR H408 questions on the invention of the barbarian, structure is your ally. For commentary questions start with precise description of the source’s content and form, then discuss purpose, audience and context, and finish with an evaluation of its usefulness for answering the question asked. For extended essays ensure your introduction gives a clear thesis that answers the question directly and outlines your line of argument. Develop paragraphs that combine assertion with evidence: cite a passage, a dramatic moment, or a visual detail, explain its significance, and link it back to the question. Where the paper asks you to use more than one type of source, make explicit comparisons: show how Herodotus’ ethnographic detail complements or contrasts with Aeschylus’ dramatic portrayal, and how material culture confirms or complicates these literary images. Remember the assessment objectives: AO1 requires accurate knowledge and contextual understanding; AO2 demands critical analysis and reasoned judgement. Time management is crucial: allocate time proportionally to the marks available, leave five to ten minutes to proofread, and plan essays briefly before writing. Use subject‑specific vocabulary — terms such as “chorus”, “peripeteia”, “iconography”, “apadana”, “ethnography” — but avoid jargon for its own sake. Finally, be prepared to judge reliability: no ancient source is neutral, and your examiner will reward a balanced answer that recognises bias, intention and the value of cross‑checking literary and archaeological evidence.
