# Augustus and the Imperial Image (A-level Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction
Augustus and the Imperial Image asks how a man who came to power in the bloody aftermath of civil war was able to create an enduring public persona that reconciled Rome to a new form of monarchical rule. This topic is centrally concerned with propaganda: the deliberate shaping of message through monuments, coinage, literature, ritual and legislation to persuade different audiences that Augustus’ rule restored order, revived traditional values, and served Rome’s long-term interests. For A‑level study this means learning to read both texts and objects as purposeful statements, to weigh what they claim against other evidence, and to judge the short‑ and long‑term effectiveness of Augustus’ campaign to control his image.

## Political and historical background
Understanding Augustus’ image-making begins with the political context in which Octavian emerged. The assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC left a power vacuum and a republic exhausted by internecine conflict. Octavian’s path from heir and triumvir to sole ruler involved military victory, skilful alliances (notably with Agrippa and, for a time, with Mark Antony and Lepidus), and an acute sensitivity to Roman hatred of explicit kingship. Augustus therefore adopted a strategy of appearing to restore the republic while concentrating power in his hands. This political balancing act informed every aspect of the imperial image: public emphasis on pietas, restoration, and moral leadership accompanied subtle constitutional innovations. Key textual evidence for Augustus’ own presentation is the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, an autobiographical inscription intended to summarise his achievements and to be read as a testament to his beneficence and legitimacy.

## The strands of Augustus’ public image
Augustus constructed a composite identity through several overlapping roles, each designed to appeal to particular constituencies. First, as Divi filius he linked himself to the deified Julius Caesar, claiming divine ancestry that bolstered his legitimacy in the eyes of soldiers and populace. Second, as Imperator he emphasised military success and the pax that followed, celebrating victories and triumphs while often obscuring the brutal realities of civil war. Third, under the title Augustus he asserted a religious and moral authority: he presented himself as restorer of traditional Roman cults, building and refurbishing temples and reviving rites, thereby positioning himself as guardian of Rome’s spiritual health. Fourth, as a culture hero and promoter of a mythic Golden Age he aligned his rule with images of peace, fertility and prosperity, evoked in the imagery of the Ara Pacis and the Secular Games. Finally, in adopting the epithet Pater Patriae and legislating on marriage and morality, Augustus sought to symbolically embody the patriarchal stability of the Roman family and state. Together these strands formed a carefully calibrated message: Augustus was not a usurper of liberty but a benefactor whose extraordinary powers were exercised for Rome’s well‑being.

## Monuments and material propaganda
Material culture was central to the imperial image because monuments and objects could be encountered by broad and diverse audiences across the city and the provinces. The Ara Pacis Augustae, a richly carved altar set within a walled precinct, is a visual manifesto of Augustan ideology: procession scenes highlight Rome’s social cohesion and piety, while vegetal motifs and allegorical figures signal peace and abundance. The Forum of Augustus and the Temple of Mars Ultor projected legal and military authority in the heart of Rome; the mausoleum and other public works physically transformed the city and offered visible evidence of benefaction. Imperial statuary such as the Augustus of Prima Porta worked on two levels: the statue’s idealised, youthful portrait echoes Greek convention and suggests timeless authority, while the cuirass relief carries specific propaganda (the return of the Parthian standards) and the figure of Cupid at Augustus’ leg links him to divine lineage. Coinage offered an even more widely disseminated medium: portraits, laureate heads, and reverse types (cornucopia, Pax, comet) circulated through daily economic life and shaped impressions among troops, merchants and provincials. Provincial monuments and cult sites such as the Sebasteion at Aphrodisias show how Augustan iconography was adapted beyond Rome, promoting the imperial cult and projecting loyalty in regional contexts. The close reading of such objects requires attention to form, context, audience and placement: a relief that elides violence in a public monument may do a different rhetorical job from a triumphal procession recited in a historian’s narrative.

## Poetry, panegyric and the managed voice
Literature was another key instrument for shaping Augustus’ image, and it came in both commissioned and independent voices. Poets who received imperial patronage were able to celebrate the regime while also experimenting with epic and lyric genres that gave cultural prestige to Augustus’ political programme. Virgil’s Aeneid exemplifies the literary side of Augustan promotion; by retelling Rome’s mythical origins and linking Aeneas’ mission to Rome’s destiny the epic legitimises the new order and glorifies pietas and duty. Horace’s Odes and the Carmen Saeculare praise Augustus directly and celebrate moral renewal and cultural revival in tones that mix genuine poetic ambition with political convenience. Elegists such as Propertius and Ovid negotiated patronage and critique in more ambiguous veins; Ovid’s Metamorphoses and his poems that echo Augustan themes complicate any simple reading of literature as mere propaganda. Literary sources must therefore be read with attention to patronage, genre expectations, and the poet’s own aesthetic aims. Alongside poetry, more direct proclamations survive: the Res Gestae is a self‑fashioned narrative of benefactions and achievements, and later historical accounts (Suetonius, for example) preserve both official claims and anecdotes that reveal tensions between image and reality. Teaching students to compare the subtle, allusive power of epic with the blunt pronouncements of the Res Gestae develops sensitivity to different rhetorical strategies and their likely audiences.

## Policy, ritual and the performance of authority
Augustus did not rely on imagery alone; his policies and rituals enacted the image he wanted to project. The restoration of temples, the revival of priesthoods, and the organisation of high-profile games such as the Secular Games provided public proof of Rome’s renewed religious order and of Augustus’ role as custodian of tradition. Moral legislation (the Lex Julia on marriage and morals, laws regulating adultery and rewarding childbearing) was a means of linking private conduct to public health and presenting Augustus as the moral tutor of the state. Administrative reforms—reorganising the city, professionalising the army, creating a settled system of provincial governance—were framed as stabilising achievements and often publicised through monuments and coins. Yet policy also exposed contradictions: the encouragement of traditional Roman simplicity sat uneasily alongside extravagant building programmes and displays of wealth. The role of close associates such as Agrippa and members of the imperial family (notably the use of Gaius and Lucius as youthful symbols of dynastic continuity) reveals that image‑making was collective as well as personal, relying on networks of patronage and public performance.

## Reception, legacy and the problem of long‑term influence
Augustus’ image was remarkably durable, but its reception varied by audience and over time. In Rome during his lifetime many welcomed peace and benefactions, but elites who valued republican forms were sometimes uneasy about the new concentration of power. In the provinces, imperial imagery promoted loyalty and the cult of the emperor, but local appropriation produced diverse expressions of Augustan ideology. Later imperial art and architecture, as well as literature and historiography, drew on Augustan models: emperors after Augustus often invoked his imagery to naturalise their own rule. Conversely, later writers such as Suetonius and Tacitus preserve critical perspectives that emphasise manipulation, coercion and the erosion of liberties. Modern scholarship continues to debate whether Augustan propaganda was a transparent mask for autocracy, a sophisticated political settlement that delivered stability, or some combination of both. These debates are useful in the classroom because they show how one can interpret the same evidence in different ways depending on questions of agency, audience and purpose.

## Interpreting the evidence: methodological cautions
Working on Imperial Image requires careful method. Texts and objects have different strengths and limitations: literary panegyric may be rhetorically powerful but partisan; the Res Gestae is self‑serving; coins are mass media but often formulaic; monuments speak in stone but have been moved, damaged, or reinterpreted over time. Students should practise triangulating evidence—cross‑checking a coin type, a passage of Horace and the archaeological context of a monument—to form balanced judgements. Attention to audience is crucial: a public altar in Rome communicates to a Roman populace differently than a provincial Sebasteion does to local elites. Equally important is genre awareness: epic constructs mythic authority, while epitaphs, official inscriptions and poems each have conventions that shape their messages. Using secondary scholarship to frame arguments is rewarded in exam answers, but students should demonstrate independent analysis and avoid uncritical repetition of scholarly views.

## Exam technique
For OCR examination on Imperial Image, answers must combine accurate factual knowledge with critical evaluation. When commenting on prescribed visual sources, begin with close description—note appearance, symbolism and original setting—and then link these formal observations to intended messages and likely audiences. In response to literary sources, identify genre, purpose and tone before assessing propaganda value. For short stimulus questions (10 marks) focus on a clear, supported judgement that directly links evidence to the question. For 20‑mark and 30‑mark essays develop a structured argument: establish a thesis, deploy a range of evidence (monuments, coins, Res Gestae, poetry), consider counter‑arguments and different audiences, and conclude by weighing the overall effectiveness of Augustus’ image. Time management is vital: allocate more time to higher‑tariff questions and plan essays briefly before writing. Use scholarly views selectively to support, challenge or deepen your analysis, always tying them back to primary evidence. Remember to address both AO1 (knowledge and context) and AO2 (analysis and evaluation): exams reward answers that not only explain what the sources say but also interrogate why they say it, for whom, and with what success.
