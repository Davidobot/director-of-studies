# Love and Relationships: Ethics, Poetry and Desire (A-level Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what this topic asks you to do
The Love and Relationships component asks you to move between ideas and texts, comparing ethical thinking about desire with poetic representations of love. You will need to combine philosophical argument — how thinkers defined and judged desire — with close reading of poetry that shows love in action: its pleasures, pains and social consequences. The central concerns are the values attached to sexual behaviour and affection, the differences between ideal and lived relationships, and how gender, status and genre shape both ethical debate and literary portrayal. In practice this means reading Plato’s accounts of love and desire alongside Stoic responses exemplified by Seneca, and contrasting these conceptual positions with the lyrical intimacy of Sappho and the witty didacticism of Ovid’s Ars Amatoria Book 3. Successful answers will show secure knowledge of social context and literary technique as well as sustained evaluation: why authors argue the way they do, and how poetry either endorses or undermines ethical claims.

## Social and cultural context: men, women, marriage and sexual norms
To interpret ideas about love you must be grounded in the social realities that inform them. Marriage in classical Athens and Republican/Imperial Rome functioned not primarily as a private romance but as a social and legal institution: it regulated property, lineage and civic status. Men, particularly elites, enjoyed wider sexual latitude than women; adultery was policed most strictly where it threatened legitimate succession or public honour. In Greece, practises of pederasty and structured homoerotic relationships existed alongside marriage; these relationships had social codes and educational aspects that can seem alien to modern assumptions. In Rome legal and moral discourse also emphasised family honour and social order, yet literature records a lively culture of extramarital affairs and erotic play. Any interpretation must balance normative prescriptions (what philosophers and lawmakers argue) with evidence of behaviour in poetry, drama and private correspondence, and must treat surviving material — especially lyric fragments and elegy — with care because it often represents elite voices rather than the whole society.

## Plato on love and desire: ascent, distinction and the moral problem
Plato approaches love as a force that can be either destructive or ennobling depending on its object and the soul’s response. His dialogues distinguish bodily desire from a higher form of love that seeks the permanent and the good. The famous ladder of love asks the beloved lover to move from attraction to a particular body, through appreciation of beauty in many bodies, to the love of minds and laws, and finally to the Form of Beauty itself. Desire, understood as erotic longing, is shown to produce intense physical symptoms and irrational behaviour, but it can be channelled toward intellectual and moral improvement. Plato also grapples with homoerotic relationships, treating them as potentially educational if they lead the young person from physical attraction to philosophical aspiration. When you write about Plato, focus on his method: dialectical argument, myth and dramatic set pieces used to test ideas. Show how his concern is ethical as well as metaphysical: love must be disciplined and directed if it is to contribute to the soul’s flourishing, and uncontrolled desire risks moral corruption and civic harm.

## Seneca on love and desire: Stoic control and the challenge of passion
Seneca, writing within the Roman Stoic tradition, treats love with scepticism and caution. For Stoics, passions are disturbances of the soul, irrational movements away from virtue; love, when it manifests as uncontrollable lust or jealous attachment, is a form of furor that undermines self-mastery. Seneca’s writings on desire combine sharp rhetoric and practical advice. He urges control through reason, the minimising of emotional dependence, and the cultivation of inner freedom. At the same time his works and plays acknowledge the power of erotic passion; this tension between theory and human experience is a rich ground for analysis. When you discuss Seneca, attend to his use of moral exempla and rhetorical invective against excess, and be ready to explore how his Stoic ideals conflict with the realities of Roman social life. You can also show how Seneca’s ethic differs from Plato’s: Plato proposes a positive use of erotic desire to ascend to the good, whereas Seneca’s remedy is often suppression and distancing from passion.

## Sappho and lyric voices: personal feeling, fragmentary evidence and female perspective
Sappho’s poetry offers a vital counterpoint: a female, intensely personal perspective that foregrounds feeling rather than philosophical abstraction. Her fragments capture the immediacy of erotic experience, the bodily effects of love, and the social rituals of affection and lament. One of the most famous images shows the lover rendered speechless, trembling and pale — a catalogue of physical symptoms that underlines how love overwhelms reason. The lyric form, performed and quickly intimate, uses vivid metaphor, direct address and mythic allusion to make private emotion public in a condensed space. A major practical issue in studying Sappho is the fragmentary nature of her work: you will need to acknowledge gaps and avoid over-generalising from a tiny corpus. Nevertheless her poems are indispensable for questions about female agency, homoerotic expression and the emotional reality of desire. In essays, connect Sappho’s concentrated lyric moments to broader themes: how poetry validates feeling as knowledge, how female desire is shaped by communal gatherings and rituals, and how myth is reworked to express personal experience.

## Ovid’s Ars Amatoria Book 3: didactic playfulness and the ethics of seduction
Ovid’s Ars Amatoria Book 3 takes a different tone: it treats love as a game to be mastered and offers practical instruction for women on how to find and keep lovers. Its mode is playful, didactic and ironic; Ovid assumes a readership attuned to performance and social manoeuvre. The poem’s authority is deliberately subversive — it instructs while seeming to promote a libertine lifestyle, and this ambivalence produces a comic critique of moralising norms. Rhetorical devices, mythological exempla used for humorous effect, and an urbane tone characterize Ovid’s approach. When assessing Ovid, consider the poem’s place within Augustan moral reforms and the poet’s own uneasy relationship with official morality. Book 3 allowed women advice that both empowers and manipulates, raising ethical questions about autonomy, deception and the commodification of the self in love.

## Themes, comparisons and how to form an argument
The heart of the unit is comparison. Plato’s ascent and Seneca’s control represent two philosophical responses to the same problem: desire’s tendency to disrupt reason and social order. Sappho and Ovid offer literary engagements that complicate abstract prescriptions by showing love’s lived texture. When you construct essays, organise your argument around a clear question: for example, whether desire ought to be controlled or transformed, or how gender shapes ethical expectations. Evidence should move from close textual analysis — language, imagery, form — to contextual interpretation: why Plato frames love as a stairway to the divine, why Seneca repeatedly warns against furor, why Sappho’s directness challenges male philosophical authority, and why Ovid’s playful counsel can be read as both liberating and corrosive. Remember to evaluate sources: lyric fragments do not provide a systematic ethical treatise, and didactic irony must be handled carefully. Consider counter-arguments and alternative readings, and make explicit how each author’s genre and audience influence their stance on love. Where possible, bring in secondary interpretations to deepen your analysis, but always anchor claims in textual detail.

## Exam technique
Answering exam questions successfully depends on planning, evidence and clarity. Begin essays by defining key terms such as eros, pietas, or furor where relevant, and state your thesis so the marker knows your line of argument from the outset. Use paragraphs that each make a discrete point supported by close reading: quote or paraphrase a short passage, analyse language and form, then link the point back to your argument and to wider cultural context. When comparing authors, alternate between texts rather than treating them in isolation; this keeps the comparison dynamic and enables direct contrast. For commentaries on Sappho or Ovid, pay attention to tone, diction and poetic technique, and for philosophical passages focus on structure of argument and use of examples or analogies. Always acknowledge limitations of the evidence — the fragmentary state of lyric, the rhetorical shape of Stoic advice, or the propagandistic uses of philosophical positions — and use these to qualify rather than undermine your claim. Manage time so you can plan, write and leave a few minutes to proofread. Finally, remember the assessment objectives: demonstrate secure knowledge and contextual understanding, and produce clear, critical analysis that uses evidence to make substantiated judgements.
