# Politics of the Late Republic: Caesar, Cicero and Cato (A-level Classical Civilisation Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Political background and institutions
To understand the politics of the late Roman Republic you must first be comfortable with the basic institutions and values those institutions embodied. The res publica was a mixed system in which magistracies, popular assemblies and the Senate all had roles, and career ambition was channelled through the cursus honorum — the ordered sequence of public offices from quaestor to consul. Magistrates held imperium, the right to command armies and governors of provinces, and could be granted extraordinary powers such as a dictatorship in an emergency. Equally important were non-constitutional practices: patronage and clientela structured social and political life, while amicitia and personal rivalries often determined alliances. By the first century BC these structures were under strain. Increasing wealth inequality, competition for provincial commands, and the unprecedented accumulation of military resources by ambitious generals created opportunities for individuals to challenge collective rule. The political labels populares and optimates are useful shorthand: populares pursued measures that appealed to the people and the assemblies, often through tribunician legislation or grain law; optimates claimed to defend senatorial prerogative and traditional normae. In practice, most leading politicians used both popular appeal and senatorial influence when it suited them, so these categories are tendencies rather than fixed factions.

## Cato the Younger: Stoic idealist and conservative
Marcus Porcius Cato (Cato the Younger) is the canonical representative of conservative opposition in the late Republic. Famous in ancient sources for his incorruptibility, austerity and uncompromising moral stance, Cato modelled his political life on Stoic principles. Stoicism, with its emphasis on self-control, virtue and duty, informed Cato’s hostility to what he saw as the moral and constitutional degradation of Roman politics. He was a stalwart defender of the Senate’s authority and an implacable opponent of popular demagogues. Cato’s public actions — obstructing policies he judged harmful, prosecuting perceived corruption, and ultimately choosing suicide over submission after the collapse of the Republican cause — made him a focal point for contemporaries and later writers who wanted to contrast personal virtue with political expediency. In studying Cato, be alert to two things: first, how Stoic ethics translated into political practice; second, the limits of the model. His intransigence appealed to those who feared the decline of republican norms, but his unwillingness to compromise is often judged to have hindered constructive solutions to deep social problems.

## Julius Caesar: populares, reformer, and dictator
Gaius Julius Caesar’s career is central to any account of the Republic’s end because he combined military genius, political daring and a willingness to exploit personal loyalty for public power. Caesar’s rise depended on a web of alliances, notably the informal first triumvirate with Pompey and Crassus, which allowed him to secure consulship and a profitable provincial command in Gaul. His conquest of Gaul (58–50 BC) made him wealthy and created armies whose loyalty was personal and tested by long campaigns. When senatorial resistance threatened his return to Rome, Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC and initiated civil war. As victor, he accepted appointments that concentrated power: perpetual dictatorship and reforms that addressed census, debt, and administration, while also planting veterans and changing municipal structures. His presentation as a popular leader who enacted reforms for the people coexisted with behaviour that conservatives saw as monarchical and anti-republican. The assassination on the Ides of March 44 BC was motivated by a mixture of idealism and self-preservation among the conspirators; they hoped to restore the Republic but underestimated the strength of Caesar’s legacy and the political consequences of violence.

## Cicero: orator, republican theorist and pragmatist
Marcus Tullius Cicero offers the clearest contemporary window into republican rhetoric, political thought and daily manoeuvre. As a novus homo who rose to the consulship, Cicero prized concordia ordinum — the cooperation of orders — and argued that the best state combined the virtues of oligarchic and popular elements. His political ideal, often expressed as cum dignitate otium (peace with dignity), shows his preference for honourable public life governed by law and senatorial leadership. In practice Cicero’s career was both principled and opportunistic: he prosecuted corruption in the Verrine affair, famously exposing Verres, and used the courts and his speeches to shape public opinion. His letters (the prescribed selection) are invaluable for historians because they record private judgments, relationships and tactical calculations. They reveal how Cicero related to Pompey, Caesar, Cato and Clodius, and they show the constant balancing between moral outrage and political necessity. Two features deserve emphasis when you study Cicero: first, his rhetorical mastery — his use of devices like anaphora, tricolon and invective in public speeches — which shaped both persuasion and historical record; second, the genre and publication history of his works. In Verrem were courtroom speeches produced for persuasion, later circulated and polished for publication; his letters were private communications that may have been selectively edited. Both are rich but they must be read with an awareness of purpose and audience.

## Key events, relationships and turning points
The politics of the late Republic pivot around a handful of events and relationships that you should be able to narrate and analyse with precision. The first triumvirate (Caesar, Pompey, Crassus) artificially balanced rival ambitions but collapsed with Crassus’s death and the rivalry between Caesar and Pompey. The civil war (49–45 BC) rearranged the political map and demonstrated the decisive role of military power. Caesar’s dictatorship and reforms evoked diverse responses: relief among those who desired order, alarm among optimates who feared monarchical rule. The assassination led not to a republican restoration but to renewed violence: the power struggle between Mark Antony and Octavian (the Second Triumvirate) ended in proscriptions and the eventual eclipse of the Republic. Personal relationships mattered enormously; marriages, client ties and political marriages were tools of alliance, while invective and legal prosecutions were tools of destruction. For essays, be ready to link events and personalities to institutional weaknesses and social change rather than treating them as isolated episodes.

## Sources, reliability and historiographical approach
The prescribed primary sources for this component are Cicero’s In Verrem and a body of his letters; these provide rich contemporary material but they also present puzzles. In Verrem is a prosecutorial text designed to persuade jurors and to justify action against a corrupt governor; its rhetorical force and selective presentation mean it must be treated critically. The letters expose private calculations and can be read for candid insight, yet they too can be edited or rhetorical. Beyond Cicero, the late Republic is known to us through later historians and biographers, numismatic and epigraphic evidence, and material culture: coins and monuments reveal public image and propaganda, while archaeological evidence can corroborate reforms and building programmes. Teaching and revision should emphasise source evaluation: ask whose voice is recorded, why that voice was recorded, what is omitted, and how the author’s position affects reliability. Comparative reading — placing Cicero’s speeches alongside less partisan evidence — will help you construct balanced arguments in essays and commentaries.

## Why the Republic fell: interpretations and arguments
Explaining the fall of the Republic requires weighing structural pressures against individual agency. Structural explanations point to widening economic inequality, the expansion of Rome’s territories and the consequent dependence on strong provincial commands, the erosion of civic norms by repeated use of irregular measures, and the failure of elites to manage reform. Personalist explanations emphasise the ambitions of figures such as Caesar and the formation of private armies whose loyalty lay with commanders rather than the state. Institutional decay — for example, the misuse of the assemblies, the politicisation of the courts, and the weaponisation of violence — made constitutional solutions harder to implement. A balanced answer recognises that personalities exploited existing weaknesses; ambition without institutional vulnerability would probably not have toppled the Republic, and institutional fragility without ambitious actors might have provoked different outcomes. When constructing essays, compare the weight of structural and individual explanations and be ready to use primary evidence (actions, speeches, reforms) to support your conclusion.

## Exam technique
To score well in this component you must combine secure factual knowledge with critical evaluation and careful use of sources. For short commentary questions begin with a clear statement identifying author, context and purpose, then analyse key words, tone and rhetorical devices, and end with a balanced judgement on what the passage reveals and its limitations. For 20 and 30 mark essays open with a focused thesis that answers the question directly and signals the line of argument. Support each paragraph with specific evidence: for political questions use institutional detail (e.g. powers of imperium, the role of assemblies), for biographical questions cite actions and speeches, and for evaluation always discuss source reliability. Show synoptic awareness by connecting political ideas to material culture or literature where appropriate, and integrate scholarly views to strengthen analysis while making clear how primary evidence supports or challenges those views. Time management is vital: spend the first few minutes planning, allocate time proportional to marks, and leave five to ten minutes to refine your conclusion. Finally, practise past-style questions using the prescribed Cicero texts so that you can quote, analyse, and evaluate with confidence in the exam.
