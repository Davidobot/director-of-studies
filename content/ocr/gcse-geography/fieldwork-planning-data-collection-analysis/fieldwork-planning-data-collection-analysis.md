# Fieldwork planning, data collection and analysis (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction to fieldwork for OCR GCSE Geography A (J383)
Fieldwork is a core part of the OCR GCSE Geography A specification and is not an optional extra. It means learning geography beyond the classroom by investigating real places and processes. The specification requires centres to provide learners with opportunities to carry out fieldwork on at least two occasions, in contrasting locations and covering both physical and human geography. These experiences give you the chance to apply classroom knowledge, practise geographical skills such as mapping and statistical analysis, and develop the confidence to investigate real-world questions. Remember that centres must submit a written fieldwork statement to OCR describing the two fieldwork occasions; this is an administrative requirement separate from your exam answers, and it must be submitted electronically by the centre by the date specified by OCR.

## Planning a fieldwork enquiry
Good fieldwork starts with a clear, focused question or hypothesis that can be investigated in the real world. When planning, think carefully about scale: are you studying a local river reach, a stretch of coastline, or patterns in an urban neighbourhood? Choose questions that match the kind of environment you will visit and the skills you need to demonstrate. For example, a river study might investigate how channel characteristics change downstream, while an urban study might examine how land use varies with distance from the city centre. Planning must include practical considerations such as permissions, health and safety, transport and timing; ethical issues for human surveys; the equipment needed; and whether a pilot visit is required to test methods. A pilot study can identify problems with your data collection sheet, timings or sampling points and will improve the reliability of your results.

## Choosing methods for data collection
Your methods must be appropriate to the question and to the environment. Physical geography techniques include measuring channel width, depth and velocity, taking pebble size samples, recording beach profiles, using clinometers to measure slope, and testing water quality (pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen). Human geography techniques include structured questionnaires, land-use surveys, pedestrian counts, observations of activity, and accessibility or amenity audits. Use maps, GPS and compasses to locate sample points accurately and include clear instructions for the use and calibration of instruments. When collecting qualitative data, such as observations or interview responses, plan how you will record them consistently. Always record units and the precision of measurements, and keep a clear, dated field notebook or electronic log so that your data traceability is immediate and obvious when you write up your findings.

## Sampling, accuracy and reliability
How you choose sample points is central to good fieldwork. Sampling strategies include random sampling, systematic sampling along a transect, stratified sampling where you sample different land-use zones, and opportunistic sampling when conditions limit choice. Each method has strengths and weaknesses. Random sampling reduces bias but may miss important zones; systematic transects are useful for studying change with distance but can under-represent variability perpendicular to the transect. Think about sample size and the time available: larger samples increase statistical confidence, but practical limits will constrain you. Accuracy and reliability depend on consistent procedures, well-calibrated equipment, and repeated measurements where possible. Consider control or comparison sites to separate natural variability from human impact. Be aware of sources of error: observer bias when categorising land use, instrument error for water meters, and temporal variation such as tide or weather changes. Recording these limitations transparently is part of good fieldwork practice.

## Processing and presenting fieldwork data
Once back from the field, the next step is to clean and organise your data. Check units, remove or explain obvious recording errors, and enter data into spreadsheets for analysis. Use appropriate graphical and cartographic techniques to present patterns clearly: maps and transect diagrams for spatial changes, scatter graphs and correlation plots for relationships between variables, histograms for size distributions, line graphs for change over distance or time, and box plots or cumulative frequency graphs to show spread and quartiles. Choropleth maps and proportional symbol maps are useful for comparing areal data such as deprivation indices or population densities. If GIS is available, use it to combine layers and show spatial relationships; otherwise clear annotated base maps and overlays are acceptable. Always label axes, include units, and choose graph types that suit the data. Present summary statistics such as mean and median, and measures of spread like range and interquartile range, to support your descriptions. When making calculations, show working so that your reasoning is traceable.

## Analysing results and drawing conclusions
Analysis goes beyond describing patterns to explaining them using geographical knowledge and theory. Link your empirical findings to processes and concepts studied in the specification. For a river study, explain why velocity and channel size increase downstream in terms of discharge and transport processes. For an urban study, relate observed land-use patterns to accessibility, historical development, and economic change. Use statistical techniques to quantify relationships: calculate correlation coefficients when investigating bivariate data, sketch trend lines on scatter plots, and consider whether interpolation or cautious extrapolation is justified. Address anomalies and outliers: these may reveal measurement error, localised features, or interesting secondary processes. Your conclusions should be directly tied to the original question, summarise the main findings clearly, and indicate the degree of confidence you have in them. A strong conclusion evaluates how far the evidence supports or refutes the hypothesis and suggests the wider significance of the results, for example implications for flood management, conservation, or planning.

## Evaluating methods and suggesting improvements
A full fieldwork account must reflect critically on the methods used. Discuss sampling limitations, measurement precision, the effect of timing and weather, and any ethical or safety constraints that affected data collection. Suggest realistic improvements: for example, increasing sample size, using more accurate instruments, sampling at multiple times to capture temporal variation, or employing stratified sampling to cover known land-use categories. Consider alternative approaches that could strengthen findings, such as paired control-impact designs, longitudinal monitoring, or combining primary data with reliable secondary sources such as government datasets. Demonstrating thoughtful evaluation shows examiners that you understand the strengths and limits of geographical enquiry and can plan better investigations in the future.

## Exam technique
When answering fieldwork questions in the exams, read the question carefully to identify which assessment objective is being tested. Examiners expect you to demonstrate knowledge (AO1), understanding (AO2), application and analysis (AO3), and use of skills (AO4). For skills questions, refer explicitly to maps, graphs and statistics you would use and why they are appropriate. When asked to design fieldwork, state a clear title or question, explain the location and scale, give a defined sampling strategy, describe specific measurement methods and equipment and justify choices in terms of reliability and validity. Use specialist terminology accurately and aim for three marks of Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar by writing concise, coherent extended answers with correct technical terms. Where numerical analysis is required, show your calculations and label units; include measures of central tendency and spread where they support your interpretation. In synoptic questions, link field findings to wider geographical theory or case studies from the specification, showing how local evidence fits global or national patterns. Finally, when discussing limitations and improvements, be specific rather than vague: mention particular instruments, sample sizes or alternative sampling designs. Practise planning, presenting and evaluating short fieldwork write-ups under timed conditions so you can produce clear, evidence-based answers in the exam.
