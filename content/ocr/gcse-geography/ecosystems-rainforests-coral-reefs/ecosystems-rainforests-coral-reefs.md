# Ecosystems: rainforests and coral reefs (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What an ecosystem is and why rainforests and coral reefs matter
An ecosystem is a community of living organisms (plants, animals and people) interacting with the non-living parts of their environment (climate, soil, water) to form a functioning system. These interactions are dynamic: energy flows through ecosystems and nutrients cycle within them. Tropical rainforests and coral reefs are two of the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. They are also highly interdependent systems where most of the available nutrients are held in living organisms rather than in the soil or water. For people they provide essential goods and services — from food, timber and medicines to coastal protection and tourism income — while for the planet they store carbon, regulate climate and support global biodiversity. Understanding their structure, processes and threats is central to GCSE Geography’s study of ecosystems and environmental management.

## Components, cycles and the idea of interdependence
Rainforests and coral reefs are built from basic abiotic components such as sunlight, temperature, rainfall, water chemistry and substrate (soil or reef rock), and biotic components including plant and animal species and human communities. In both systems nutrient cycling is rapid and tight. In tropical rainforests most nutrients are stored in vegetation; heavy rainfall promotes fast decomposition and the quick uptake of nutrients by roots and leaf litter, leaving soils thin and easily degraded if the forest is removed. Coral reefs operate in warm, clear, low-nutrient ocean waters where corals and reef organisms efficiently recycle nutrients through symbioses and localized food webs. Energy enters both systems primarily through sunlight — driving photosynthesis in rainforest plants and in reef algae, including the symbiotic zooxanthellae that live inside coral tissues. These tight links mean that a change in one component, for example the loss of a tree species or a rise in seawater temperature, can ripple through the whole ecosystem.

## Tropical rainforests: distribution, structure and processes
Tropical rainforests are found around the equator in regions such as the Amazon Basin, the Congo Basin, Madagascar, Southeast Asia and parts of Australasia. Climatically they are warm year-round with high, often seasonal, rainfall and little temperature variation. Structurally they are vertically complex, with emergent trees, a closed canopy, an understorey of smaller trees and shrubs, and a forest floor rich in decomposers. The water cycle in rainforests is driven by high rates of evapotranspiration: leaves intercept rain, transpiration returns moisture to the atmosphere and frequent convectional rainfall helps sustain the local and regional climate. The nutrient cycle is rapid: dead leaves and wood are quickly decomposed and the nutrients are rapidly taken up by plant roots or absorbed by epiphytes and climbers. Because so much nutrient is tied up in living biomass, deforestation quickly depletes the system’s fertility and leads to soil erosion and decreased productivity.

The value of rainforests to people is wide-ranging. They support indigenous communities that rely on hunting, gathering and small-scale agriculture, supply timber and non-timber forest products, and are a global store of carbon. Threats include logging (both legal and illegal), conversion to agriculture and cattle ranching, mining, plantation development (for example oil palm), road building and urban expansion. These activities reduce biodiversity, release carbon dioxide, increase runoff and sedimentation, and fragment habitats. Management responses range from protected areas and sustainable forest certification to agroforestry, selective logging and international mechanisms such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). A clear case study to use in exams is the Amazon: students should be able to describe how drivers such as cattle ranching, soy cultivation and infrastructure projects have affected forest cover, biodiversity and local climate, and evaluate conservation efforts.

## Coral reefs: location, biology and vulnerability
Warm-water coral reefs occur in tropical shallow seas, lining coastlines and forming large systems like the Great Barrier Reef off Australia, the Mesoamerican Reef in the Caribbean, and reefs around the Red Sea and Pacific islands. Reefs require sunlight for the photosynthetic algae (zooxanthellae) that live inside coral polyps; they therefore grow in clear, shallow water with low sediment input. Reefs are biological hotspots: corals build calcium carbonate structures over long periods, creating complex three-dimensional habitats that support thousands of species, from fish and crustaceans to marine plants and microbes.

Nutrient dynamics in reefs are different from terrestrial systems. Open ocean waters feeding reefs are usually nutrient-poor, so reef communities have evolved efficient internal recycling. Many reef organisms are tightly linked; for example, grazing fish control algal growth that would otherwise smother young corals. Coral bleaching is a key vulnerability: when seawater temperatures rise even slightly, corals expel their zooxanthellae, losing colour and, often, their major source of energy. If stressful conditions persist, corals die and reef structure degrades. Other threats include ocean acidification (which reduces corals’ ability to build calcium carbonate skeletons), overfishing and destructive fishing techniques, coastal development and land-based pollution that increases sediment and nutrient runoff, and damage from tourism and shipping.

The Great Barrier Reef provides a useful example for case-study work. In recent decades it has experienced repeated mass bleaching events linked to marine heatwaves, causing coral mortality and changes in species composition. Management efforts include zoning within marine protected areas, restrictions on fishing, water quality improvement programmes targeting agricultural runoff and reef restoration projects. In exam answers students should be able to assess how effective these measures are and explain why global actions on greenhouse gas emissions are essential for reef survival.

## Values, services and the human dimension
Both rainforests and coral reefs deliver ecosystem services that are economic, social and environmental. Rainforests store carbon, reduce erosion, regulate local climates and provide resources and cultural identity for many communities. Coral reefs protect coastlines by absorbing wave energy, support fisheries that feed millions of people, underpin tourism economies and are a source of novel medicines. The loss of these ecosystems therefore has local consequences — loss of livelihoods, increased flood risk or reduced fish stocks — and global consequences — higher atmospheric carbon and biodiversity loss.

Human activities are both the cause of many threats and a necessary part of solutions. Sustainable management must balance the needs of local people with conservation goals. Examples include community-managed marine reserves that allow traditional fishing while protecting breeding areas, payment-for-ecosystem-services schemes that compensate landowners for conserving forest, and ecotourism models that channel income into local stewardship. Effective strategies are usually multi-level, combining local action with national policy and international agreements, because drivers such as climate change and international commodity markets require coordinated responses.

## Fieldwork, skills and how to study these ecosystems
Fieldwork brings ecosystems to life and is a required part of GCSE Geography. Practical investigations in rainforest margins, coastal mangroves near reefs, or in local woodlands and beaches can develop the same kinds of skills that are used to study tropical ecosystems: careful observation, measurement, sampling and analysis. Techniques useful for rainforest study include transects and quadrats to record plant species and canopy structure, soil sampling to test fertility and texture, and water measurements to assess local hydrology. For coral reefs, fieldwork methods include underwater transects and quadrats to record coral cover and species abundance, water temperature and pH monitoring, and measuring turbidity and nutrient concentrations to assess runoff impacts. Where direct access to tropical sites is not possible, fieldwork can use remote sensing, GIS mapping, analysis of secondary datasets and evaluation of case-study reports. In all cases it is important to plan investigations with clear questions, representative sampling, and awareness of safety and ethical considerations.

## Management and sustainable solutions — local to global
Managing rainforests and coral reefs requires reducing direct local pressures and tackling broader drivers. Locally, actions include establishing protected areas, enforcing sustainable fishing and forestry practices, restoring degraded areas through replanting or coral gardening, and improving land-use planning to reduce sediment and nutrient runoff to reefs. Socially inclusive approaches that involve indigenous and local communities tend to be more sustainable because they integrate traditional knowledge and secure livelihoods.

National and international measures are also vital. Forest governance, law enforcement against illegal logging, agricultural policies that reduce the need for clearance, and economic incentives for sustainable production help reduce rainforest loss. For reefs, national policies on coastal development, wastewater treatment and fisheries management are crucial. Internationally, climate change mitigation is central: reducing greenhouse gas emissions lowers the frequency and severity of coral bleaching and protects forest carbon stocks. Schemes such as REDD+ and marine protected area networks create financial and legal mechanisms to support conservation, but their success depends on political will, funding and local engagement. Restoration techniques such as coral transplantation and assisted evolution show promise but are not substitutes for addressing root causes. In exam answers students should weigh short-term local fixes against long-term systemic changes and recognise trade-offs and uncertainties.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about rainforests and coral reefs, start by making sure you address the command word precisely: describe, explain, assess, evaluate and suggest each demand different responses. Always link physical processes to human impacts and vice versa to show synoptic understanding. For case study questions use at least one clear, contemporary example of a rainforest and one coral reef; include specific locations, the drivers of change, and both environmental and human consequences. In extended responses structure your answer logically: introduce the issue, explain key processes or causes, illustrate with case-study evidence, evaluate the effectiveness of management or the relative importance of causes, and conclude with a balanced judgement. Where fieldwork is relevant, refer to methods, data types and limitations, and show how field evidence supports wider conclusions. Use geographical terminology correctly (for example, evapotranspiration, leaching, symbiosis, coral bleaching, marine protected area) and aim for clear, accurate spelling, punctuation and grammar. Practice drawing clear, labelled diagrams such as a rainforest vertical profile or a reef cross-section to support explanations, and practise interpreting maps, graphs and unseen resources so you can apply skills under exam conditions. Above all, be prepared to link local examples to global processes: the best answers make these connections and show an understanding of the complex interdependence between people and ecosystems.
