# People and cities in the UK (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why study people and cities in the UK
Studying people and cities in the UK brings together physical and human geography to explain how places are shaped, used and experienced. At GCSE level you are expected to understand the patterns and processes that create regional differences, the causes and consequences of population change, and the complex ways in which cities develop and change. The UK is both a single country and a collection of contrasting places: global cities like London sit alongside small post‑industrial towns, coastal resorts and fast‑growing university cities. Learning the people and cities topic helps you link local and lived experience to national trends and global connections, and it prepares you for the skills and case studies you will be examined on in all three components of the OCR GCSE Geography A course.

## UK population: structure, change and consequences
The UK’s population has changed substantially since 1900. Birth rates, death rates and improvements in healthcare have moved the country through the stages of the Demographic Transition Model so that today the UK has a relatively low birth rate and an ageing population. An ageing population creates pressures on public services and the economy: demand for healthcare and pensions increases, the proportion of working‑age people falls, and local areas may need to adapt housing and transport to be more accessible. Conversely, areas with younger populations often need more schools and family services.

Population structure is visible through tools such as population pyramids, which summarise age and sex distributions for places and can be used in both case study discussion and fieldwork analysis. When preparing a case study, make sure you can explain causes (for example, declining fertility, improved life expectancy, migration) and effects (service demand, changes to labour supply, political and economic implications) and evaluate how local and national policymakers respond, for example through retirement age policies, targeted housing, or services for older people.

## Migration and the UK’s connections with the world
Migration has been one of the most important drivers of population change in the UK during the 21st century. International migration has reshaped cities, labour markets and cultures. People arrive from former Commonwealth countries, European countries, and further afield, bringing skills and creating new communities. Migration influences urban character, contributes to population growth in some places, and can help fill labour market shortages in sectors such as healthcare, hospitality and technology.

The UK’s global connections extend beyond migration. Trade and investment link the UK to major world partners; historical ties and contemporary diplomacy shape flows of goods, services and people. When you write about the UK’s connections, be specific about principal trading partners and the types of goods or services involved, and explain how these links affect local economies. For example, global financial links reinforce London’s role as a world city, while regional manufacturing and port activity connect places such as Liverpool and Hull to international markets.

## Patterns of development and regional inequality
Uneven development within the UK is a central idea to understand. Geographic location, historical economic change, infrastructure and government policy all influence why some regions prosper while others experience long‑term decline. The shift from primary and secondary industries to services and high‑value knowledge sectors since the late 20th century has benefited cities with strong universities, good transport links and investment, while former industrial areas experienced deindustrialisation, job losses and social challenges.

When discussing regional inequality, name clear examples to support your explanation. The “North–South” contrast is a useful starting point but simplify it to show causes: legacy industries, investment patterns, and access to global markets. Use case studies of a region that has experienced decline and another that has grown to illustrate consequences: population loss or ageing, changes in employment structure, differences in life expectancy and income, and the policy responses—investment zones, transport projects, retraining programmes and regeneration schemes. Explaining specific local consequences makes your answers stronger and shows you can apply geography at different scales.

## Urban processes: suburbanisation, counter‑urbanisation and re‑urbanisation
Cities are not static. Urban processes such as suburbanisation, counter‑urbanisation and re‑urbanisation shape how people live and how places function. Suburbanisation is the spread of housing and services into suburbs as people seek more space and improved living conditions, often driven by rising car ownership and new housing development. Counter‑urbanisation is the movement of people out of urban centres to smaller towns and rural areas, sometimes driven by the desire for a different lifestyle or teleworking opportunities. Re‑urbanisation is the return of people and investment to city centres, often associated with regeneration, the growth of tertiary and quaternary sectors, improved cultural facilities and apartments replacing former industrial sites.

These processes have consequences for housing supply and affordability, transport demand, the character of neighbourhoods, and social segregation. In towns that lose population, local economies can shrink and services close; in re‑urbanised areas, gentrification can improve the built environment while pricing out long‑standing residents. In the exam, you should be ready to describe causes and consequences, and to link these processes to examples such as the regeneration of former docklands, the expansion of commuter belts around major cities, or the growth of university towns.

## Cities in the UK: character, challenges and sustainable strategies
A city case study must cover the city’s role at local, national and global scales, patterns of migration and their impact, ways of life, contemporary challenges and sustainable strategies used to tackle these challenges. Choose a city you know well—London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds and Bristol all provide rich material—and describe how migration, culture, housing, transport and employment shape everyday life. Explain challenges such as housing shortages, transport congestion, air quality issues and waste management, and be prepared to assess strategies aimed at sustainability. For housing, this could include affordable housing programmes, brownfield redevelopment and planning policies; for transport, strategies might include bus and tram networks, cycling infrastructure, and congestion charging; for waste and resource management, describe recycling programmes, waste‑to‑energy plants and local initiatives to reduce consumption.

When evaluating sustainable strategies, consider social, economic and environmental trade‑offs. For example, high‑density development near transit can reduce car dependence and conserve greenfield land but may raise concerns about local character or affordability. Good answers will balance evidence of success with realistic limits and offer reasoned judgments about which approaches are most useful for different urban issues.

## Fieldwork, data and geographical skills
Fieldwork is an essential part of studying people and cities because it grounds theory in real data and lived experience. OCR requires centres to provide at least two fieldwork opportunities in contrasting locations and contexts. For students, fieldwork offers the chance to design enquiries, collect primary data through surveys, questionnaires and environmental quality assessments, and to present results using maps, charts and statistical measures. In human geography fieldwork, you might investigate pedestrian flow in a city centre, compare retail change along a high street, survey attitudes to local services, or measure housing quality in different neighbourhoods.

Data skills are vital for both fieldwork and exams. Be confident using maps (scale, coordinates, OS features), interpreting choropleth maps and flow lines, and constructing and analysing graphs such as line charts, histograms and scatter plots. Understand basic statistics: mean, median, mode, range and inter‑quartile range, and be able to sketch trends, draw lines of best fit and make sensible predictions. In exam answers use data to support conclusions: quote figures from fieldwork or published sources, describe patterns, and acknowledge limitations such as sample size or bias.

## Exam technique
Exam questions on people and cities test a mix of knowledge, application, skills and judgement. Read the question carefully and identify the command words—describe, explain, assess, evaluate—and the scale you are being asked to consider. For short response questions be precise and include place‑specific detail when required. For 6‑mark questions structure your answer with clear points supported by examples or data and a short conclusion. For extended 12‑mark responses begin with a brief introduction that sets out your argument, develop balanced paragraphs that explain causes, consequences and responses, and finish with a reasoned judgement. Use geographical terminology throughout and aim to include synoptic links: connect urban change to national economic shifts, migration patterns to cultural change, or energy and environmental policy to local planning decisions.

When you are asked to use resources or unseen stimuli, extract and interpret relevant information first, then combine it with your own geographical knowledge. For fieldwork‑based questions, demonstrate understanding of enquiry design, evidence collection, limitations and reliability, and show how data lead to conclusions. Remember there are marks for Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPaG) on extended answers, so write clearly, use paragraphs, and include specialist terms accurately. Finally, practice applying numerical skills in context: calculate percentage changes, comment on patterns in graphs, and use simple statistics appropriately to strengthen your conclusions. Clear, evidence‑based and well‑structured answers will score highly.
