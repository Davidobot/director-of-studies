# Global development and uneven development (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what we mean by development and uneven development
Development describes changes in the quality of life and economic wellbeing of people in different places. At GCSE level you will meet social, economic and environmental definitions of development that together help build a full picture of how and why places differ. Social measures include life expectancy, literacy and access to services; economic measures focus on income, employment structure and trade; environmental measures consider resource use and sustainability. Uneven development is the simple observation that some countries and regions are richer, healthier and more technologically advanced than others. This difference is the result of many interacting historical, physical, political and economic factors that operate at local, national and global scales. Understanding uneven development means thinking about causes, consequences and responses, and using indicators and case studies to make those ideas concrete.

## Measuring development: indicators and their strengths and limitations
You need to be able to explain and use a range of development indicators, and to evaluate what they actually tell us. Gross National Income (GNI) per capita gives an average measure of wealth and is widely used to compare countries, but it hides inequalities within countries and ignores non‑market activity. The Human Development Index (HDI) combines income with education and life expectancy to give a broader picture of wellbeing. Other useful measures include literacy rates, infant mortality, access to clean water, and Internet users, each revealing different aspects of development. Maps and graphs such as choropleth maps, population pyramids and flow‑line maps are powerful ways to show patterns: a choropleth map of GNI per capita makes spatial patterns of wealth clear, while a population pyramid highlights age structure and potential economic pressures. Remember to comment on limitations: averages can conceal regional inequality, official statistics may be outdated or incomplete, and different indicators can rank the same country very differently. Good exam answers will combine several indicators to provide a balanced judgement.

## Causes of uneven development: historical, physical and economic factors
Uneven development has deep roots. Historical factors such as colonialism reshaped global trade networks and left many countries dependent on a narrow range of exports and on extractive institutions. Physical geography matters too: landlocked countries or those with harsh climates and disease burdens face extra costs and constraints, while countries with favourable climates, fertile soils and natural harbours had earlier opportunities to develop trade. Economic factors include the structure of the economy; countries reliant on primary commodities tend to have more volatile incomes and fewer opportunities to add value than countries with diversified manufacturing and services sectors. Political stability, governance and infrastructure also play central roles: stable, well‑governed countries tend to attract more investment and to provide better education and healthcare. Finally, global processes such as trade rules, debt, the activities of multinational corporations and patterns of foreign direct investment create winners and losers. All these causes interact: for example, a country with a history of extractive colonial rule may also struggle to attract diversified investment and suffer entrenched inequality.

## How development changes: models, investment and trade
To explain how countries develop, you will be asked to use simple models and to understand the roles played by trade and investment. Rostow’s stages of growth provide a sequence from traditional society to high mass consumption; it is a useful framework for organising ideas but is a generalised model that does not fit every country’s path. Foreign direct investment and the expansion of global trade have been powerful engines of growth for many emerging and developing countries. Multinational corporations (MNCs) can bring jobs, technology and access to global markets, but they can also exploit cheap labour, repatriate profits and create environmental damage. Trade can drive growth when countries diversify and add value, but dependence on a few commodities exposes countries to price shocks. Remittances from migrants and overseas development assistance also inject money into economies, but their effects vary with governance and local capacity. When you evaluate development paths in exams, analyse both the benefits and the drawbacks of trade and investment, and consider long‑term sustainability.

## Case study guidance: choosing and using an LIDC or EDC example
The specification requires a case study of one low‑income developing country (LIDC) or emerging and developing country (EDC). Your case study should be contemporary and cover interrelated factors: geographical location and natural resources, political development and relationships with other states, principal imports and exports, the role of international investment, population and employment changes, social factors such as education and healthcare, technological developments, and at least one aid project. Good choices are countries where recent change is clear and well documented, such as India, Vietnam, Nigeria or Bangladesh. For example, India illustrates rapid economic growth driven by services and technology, major internal regional contrasts, and both benefits and costs of global integration. Nigeria illustrates the resource curse: large oil revenues alongside inequality, governance challenges and environmental impacts in the Niger Delta. For each element of your case study, be specific and give data where possible: describe the main exports and their contribution to GDP, explain how foreign investment has affected particular industries, and assess social indicators over time. Use Rostow’s model to discuss the country’s developmental path but support your judgement by referencing real evidence and acknowledging complexities.

## Urbanisation, cities and the consequences of rapid growth in LIDCs and EDCs
A major global trend you must understand is urbanisation. Most of the world’s population now lives in urban areas and many of the fastest growing cities are in LIDCs and EDCs. Rapid urban growth leads to the expansion of megacities and the creation of informal settlements or slums, where housing, sanitation and access to services are often inadequate. Cities such as Lagos, Dhaka and Mumbai demonstrate how rapid in‑migration and natural population growth create pressure for housing, transport, waste management and employment. The informal economy provides livelihoods for many migrants, but it also means limited tax revenue and lack of worker protections. Environmental consequences include air and water pollution, congestion and loss of green space. There are social consequences too: unequal access to education and healthcare, and the creation of spatial segregation within cities. Effective responses range from slum upgrading and affordable housing schemes to improvements in public transport and provision of basic services; evaluation in exam answers should consider feasibility, funding and long‑term sustainability.

## Aid, debt and sustainable development: interventions and controversies
Aid remains a contested part of the development story. Different types of aid include bilateral aid between two countries, multilateral aid through organisations such as the World Bank, and aid from non‑governmental organisations. Aid can fund infrastructure, health and education projects that support development, but it can also create dependency, distort local markets or be tied to donor interests. Debt and structural adjustment programmes have historically forced difficult policy choices on borrowing countries, sometimes reducing public spending on services. Sustainable development, which balances economic growth with social inclusion and environmental protection, is central to modern thinking about development. In practice this means evaluating the long‑term viability of development projects, considering environmental impacts such as deforestation or water stress, and supporting local capacity building so that benefits are resilient. When writing about aid and interventions in an exam, weigh short‑term gains against long‑term costs and ask who benefits and who bears the risks.

## Using evidence, maps and statistics in answers
Geography exams reward clear use of evidence and skillful interpretation of maps, graphs and statistics. When you use a choropleth map of GDP, a population pyramid, a trade flow map or graphs of HDI over time, always describe what the data show and then analyse what it implies about development processes. Be prepared to calculate simple percentage changes, read values from graphs, and draw conclusions from bivariate plots. Fieldwork and local data offer particularly strong evidence for supporting arguments: for example, a study of local transport usage or housing conditions can be used to compare local realities with national statistics. Always acknowledge limits of the data you use: explain why national aggregates may mask regional inequalities and why some data sources may be biased or out of date.

## Exam technique
Answer the question directly and plan before you write. Start with a clear introduction that defines key terms and outlines your approach, then structure the body so that each paragraph has a clear focus: for example, causes, consequences and responses, or economic, social and environmental perspectives. Use your case study material precisely: name the country or city, give specific facts or figures where you can, and link these facts back to the question. When evaluating, weigh different viewpoints and consider scale, timescale and who benefits. Use geographical terminology (for example, GNI per capita, HDI, informal economy, push‑pull migration) and insert evidence from maps, graphs or fieldwork to support your points. For extended answers allocate time to plan, write and proofread; aim for clear paragraphs with topic sentences and conclude by summarising your judgement. Remember the SPaG marks: check spelling of key terms, use correct punctuation, and use specialist vocabulary accurately. Lastly, practice using past question styles, develop concise case study notes you can deploy under time pressure, and get comfortable interpreting unseen resources so that your answers are both factual and analytical.
