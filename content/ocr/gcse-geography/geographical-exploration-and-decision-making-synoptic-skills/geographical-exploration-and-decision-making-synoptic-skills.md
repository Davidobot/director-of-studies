# Geographical exploration and decision-making (synoptic skills) (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What the synoptic paper is and why it matters
The Geographical Exploration component (J384/03) is the synoptic element of the OCR Geography B GCSE. It is a 1 hour 30 minute written paper worth 60 marks and contributes 30% of the overall qualification. Its purpose is to bring together ideas, concepts and skills from across the other two components — Our Natural World and People and Society — and test your ability to think like a geographer. Rather than checking isolated facts, this paper asks you to apply your knowledge to an unfamiliar country context, to interpret a range of unseen resources and to make reasoned judgements in a decision-making exercise. Success in this paper shows you can connect topics, use fieldwork and cartographic skills, analyse data, evaluate options and justify recommendations in the way professional geographers do.

## Synoptic thinking: what examiners mean by “thinking like a geographer”
Synoptic assessment asks you to make links across different topics and scales. This means moving beyond recalling a case study to explaining how processes and human decisions interact. For example, linking a warming climate (Changing Climate) to changing patterns of food production (Resource Reliance) requires you to combine physical processes, socio-economic effects and policy responses. Similarly, thinking about an expanding city (Urban Futures) alongside local water stress (UK in the 21st Century) asks you to balance population dynamics, infrastructure, environmental limits and governance. Examiners are looking for answers that show conceptual understanding, the ability to apply that understanding to new situations, and the capacity to evaluate trade-offs and uncertainties. Practising this kind of cross-topic reasoning is the best preparation.

## The Decision-Making Exercise: structure and approach
A central feature of the synoptic paper is the Decision-Making Exercise (DME). This is typically framed around a realistic problem in a named country or region: for instance, whether to allow further tourism development in a fragile rainforest, whether to build a dam in a river basin, or how to make an expanding city more sustainable. The DME provides a set of options and supporting resources and asks you to choose the best option, justify that choice using evidence, and reflect on the strengths and limitations of the evidence and the decision. When approaching a DME in the exam, begin by reading the scenario and its resources carefully, annotating the resource booklet with clear links to topics you have studied. Identify the stakeholders affected, define the criteria you will use to judge the options (economic benefit, environmental damage, social justice, feasibility, long-term sustainability), and weight these criteria explicitly in your answer. A strong response explains why one option is preferable, uses evidence from the resources and from your own case studies or fieldwork, acknowledges uncertainties or data gaps, and offers a clear, evidence-based recommendation.

## Core geographical skills tested in synoptic questions
Geographical skills are integrated throughout the synoptic assessment. Cartographic skills such as interpreting choropleth maps, flow-line maps and isoline maps, and calculating distances and gradients, often appear in resource-based questions. Graphical skills, including drawing and interpreting line graphs, scatter plots and population pyramids, are used to show temporal trends and relationships. Statistical skills are also required: you may need to calculate percentages, interpret measures of central tendency and spread, suggest trends from bivariate data, or explain weaknesses in a statistical presentation. GIS-style reasoning — interpreting layered spatial data, recognising spatial patterns and weighing scale — is increasingly important in synoptic contexts. Above all, fieldwork skills matter: you should be able to explain how primary data you collected supports or contradicts the unseen evidence, to appraise data collection methods and to reflect on reliability, sample size and bias. Practise applying these skills to unfamiliar datasets so that you can use them confidently on the day.

## Using fieldwork effectively in synoptic answers
Fieldwork forms a practical and examinable bridge between theory and the real world. The GCSE requires centres to offer fieldwork on at least two occasions in contrasting locations, covering physical and human contexts. In the synoptic paper you will be expected to draw on those experiences when interpreting unfamiliar material. Good use of fieldwork in an answer begins with concise, relevant references: describe the question investigated, the method you used, the main findings and how they relate to the unseen context. For example, if your fieldwork measured beach profile changes or water quality, explain how those measurements provide evidence for wider processes such as erosion, sediment transport or pollution, and how they inform decisions about coastal management or water resource allocation. Remember to evaluate the strengths and limitations of your data: small sample sizes, measurement accuracy and human error all affect the confidence you can place in conclusions. Exam answers that combine field data with secondary evidence from the resource booklet and wider case study knowledge demonstrate the integrative skills synoptic marking rewards.

## Typical synoptic links and worked examples
Practising explicit links between topics makes synoptic thinking habitual. One common link asks you to combine Changing Climate with Resource Reliance: for instance, how altered precipitation patterns affect crop yields, pushing a country from food self-sufficiency towards reliance on imports or aid. A worked example could consider the effects of more intense seasonal rainfall on rice productivity in a low-income country, connecting soil erosion, irrigation needs, market access and the role of TNC investment in agricultural technology. Another frequent theme is the intersection of Urban Futures and Sustaining Ecosystems: urban expansion into peri-urban wetlands reduces biodiversity and flood buffering capacity, increasing flood risk while undermining local livelihoods that depended on wetland services. A good synoptic answer would link land-use change to ecosystem service loss, discuss policy responses such as protected areas or green infrastructure, and weigh economic development against long-term environmental costs. When you practise, make sure each example contains physical processes, human responses, scale considerations and a judgement about the best way forward.

## Assessment focus, AOs and the role of SPaG
The synoptic paper assesses all four assessment objectives. You will need to demonstrate knowledge (AO1), show geographical understanding of concepts and interrelationships (AO2), apply understanding to interpret and evaluate information and make judgements (AO3), and select and use a variety of skills and techniques, including fieldwork methods and quantitative skills (AO4). Extended responses in this paper carry SPaG marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar and for correct use of specialist terminology; J384/03 includes three SPaG marks. Examiners expect precise technical language such as “runoff,” “inter-quartile range,” “mitigation,” or “ecosystem services” used appropriately. Accuracy in quantitative work and clarity in reasoning are assessed as part of the overarching objective to make justified decisions. Practise writing clear paragraphs that begin with a focused sentence, present evidence, analyse its significance, and end with a short evaluative or linking sentence.

## Preparing for the synoptic exam in your revision
Effective preparation combines content revision with skill practice. Revise core concepts across the eight topics so you can transfer them to new contexts: understand the causes and impacts of climate change, patterns of urbanisation, processes that shape coastal and river landscapes, the drivers of uneven development, and the challenges of resource security. At the same time, build confidence with maps, graphs and statistics by working through unfamiliar resource booklets and practising calculations under timed conditions. Rehearse DMEs by using past or mock scenarios: make a short plan that lists stakeholders, criteria, evidence from resources and fieldwork, then write a concise but balanced decision with explicit justification. Keep a portfolio of brief case-study summaries that include scale, key facts, dates and an evaluative sentence about success and limitations; these are quick to deploy in exam answers and show the examiner you can place new material into a real-world framework.

## Exam technique
Before you start writing, read the whole paper and the accompanying Resource Booklet carefully so you understand the context and the sources available. For the Decision-Making Exercise, annotate the resources as you read, underlining key facts, figures and map features and noting any connections to fieldwork or case studies you know. Spend a few minutes planning extended answers: identify the question’s command word, set out the criteria you will use to judge options, and sketch the structure of your response. When using numerical evidence, show your working and interpret the numbers — do not assume the examiner will infer the significance. In longer answers, aim for a clear structure where each paragraph makes one main point, links to evidence, analyses the implication and then evaluates or qualifies the point. Use specialist vocabulary correctly and keep sentences concise to protect SPaG marks; a brief concluding sentence that summarises your judgement or recommendation reinforces coherence. Manage your time so that you allocate effort proportional to the mark value of each question; leave a few minutes to review extended responses for clarity, add a short evaluation of limitations or uncertainties, and correct any obvious spelling or punctuation errors. Finally, practise under timed conditions using unseen resources so that on the day you can move from comprehension to analysis and decision confidently and efficiently.
