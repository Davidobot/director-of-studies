# Changing climate: evidence and impacts (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why climate change matters
Climate change is one of the most important geographical issues of the 21st century because it affects environments, economies and societies at every scale. To understand the topic fully you need to be able to read the long record of past climates, recognise current trends from recent measurements, and link cause to effect. The Earth’s climate has varied naturally through time, especially during the Quaternary period of repeated ice ages and warmer interglacial phases, but since the Industrial Revolution the planet has warmed much faster than most natural cycles would predict. That rapid change brings new risks for people and places, and it is why climate change is studied across both physical and human geography themes.

## Evidence for past and present climate change
Geographers use many types of evidence to build a picture of how climate has changed. Instrumental records of temperature and rainfall give the clearest picture of recent change: thermometer data collected from the mid-19th century onwards show a sustained rise in global average temperatures, particularly since the mid-20th century. To reach further back in time, scientists use proxy data. Ice cores drilled from Greenland and Antarctica preserve layers of snow laid down over hundreds of thousands of years; trapped air bubbles in those layers record past concentrations of greenhouse gases and provide temperature proxies. Tree rings, lake sediments and coral growth bands also record past conditions, each with its own strengths and limitations in terms of timespan and resolution. Changes in sea ice extent and glacier length are visible, sometimes illustrated by historical paintings and diaries that describe frozen rivers, larger glaciers or shifts in seasonal patterns; these cultural sources can support scientific records when interpreted carefully. Each type of evidence must be evaluated: instrumental records are precise but short, proxies extend the timeline but can be less direct measures of temperature, and historical records may be subjective. By combining many independent lines of evidence, a consistent picture emerges of significant climate variation over geological time and a clear recent warming trend.

## Natural causes of climate variability
Several natural processes drive long-term and shorter-term climate variability. Over tens of thousands of years, cyclical changes in Earth’s orbit and tilt — known as Milankovitch cycles — alter the distribution of incoming solar radiation and drive the succession of ice ages and interglacial periods. On shorter timescales, large volcanic eruptions can cool the planet for a few years by injecting reflective particles into the stratosphere; a famous example is the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 which contributed to the “Year Without a Summer” in 1816. Solar variability, including changes in sunspot activity, affects the amount of energy reaching Earth and has been linked to past cooler periods when solar output was low. Internal climate variability such as El Niño and La Niña events redistributes heat between ocean and atmosphere and causes regional extremes in rainfall and temperature. These natural factors are real and have shaped climate history, but they operate at particular timescales and amplitudes. The recent global warming trend cannot be fully explained by these natural influences alone, especially given the rapid rise in greenhouse gases since the 19th century.

## The greenhouse effect and human influence
The natural greenhouse effect is essential: gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap some of the Sun’s outgoing heat and keep the planet warm enough to support life. The problem in recent centuries is the enhanced greenhouse effect, where human activity has increased concentrations of these gases, strengthening the heat-trapping layer and raising global temperatures. Fossil fuel burning for energy and transport, deforestation, and intensive agriculture are the main sources of extra CO2 and CH4. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now higher than at any time in at least several hundred thousand years, and the rate of increase in the last century is exceptional. This anthropogenic forcing adds energy to the climate system and shifts the likelihood and intensity of extreme events, while also causing slower changes such as melting ice sheets and thermal expansion of the oceans.

## Global impacts of a changing climate
The impacts of climate change are wide-ranging and vary by place, but several themes are clear. Sea levels are rising because oceans expand as they warm and because ice on land — glaciers and ice sheets — is melting. Higher sea levels increase coastal erosion, flood risk, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies, threatening low-lying islands and river deltas. Weather extremes are becoming more frequent or intense in many regions: heatwaves and droughts are more likely, some areas suffer heavier rainfall and flooding, and other regions experience increased wildfire risk. Ecosystems feel the effects too: coral reefs are bleaching as ocean temperatures rise and oceans become slightly more acidic, species ranges shift polewards or upslope, and seasonal cycles such as flowering and migration alter. These environmental changes have social and economic consequences. Agriculture is sensitive to shifting rainfall and temperature patterns, with some regions becoming less suitable for traditional crops and others potentially gaining new opportunities. Health risks rise with heat stress, changing disease vectors and food insecurity. Economically, damage to infrastructure, higher insurance costs and loss of ecosystem services can be substantial, and some communities may face displacement when environments become unlivable.

## Impacts within the UK
The UK’s climate has warmed over recent decades and projections show further warming, with changes affecting many aspects of life. Winters are generally milder and wetter, especially in the north and west, while summers are projected to become hotter, with more frequent heatwaves in the south and east. Increased winter rainfall and more intense short-duration storms have heightened flood risk for rivers and urban drainage systems, while sea-level rise and storm surge combine to increase coastal flood and erosion hazards in low-lying areas such as parts of east England. These physical changes have human consequences: agriculture may need to adapt crops and practices as seasons shift, coastal communities face costly defences or managed retreat decisions, and urban areas must prepare for overheating and water management challenges. The UK has already experienced notable weather-related events that illustrate these pressures, including severe summer heatwaves and winter storms that caused widespread flooding and disruption. Learning to link these physical changes to local case studies helps explain why planning and adaptation are essential.

## Responses: mitigation and adaptation
Responses to climate change split broadly into mitigation — reducing the scale of future change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions — and adaptation — adjusting human and natural systems to live with the change already underway. Mitigation examples include transitioning to low-carbon energy sources such as wind, solar and hydro, improving energy efficiency in buildings and transport, protecting and restoring forests that absorb CO2, and changing agricultural practices to reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Adaptation measures range from hard engineering solutions, such as sea walls and flood barriers, to nature-based approaches like restoring wetlands and managed realignment of shores so that natural processes reduce risk. In cities, adaptation includes designing heat-resilient buildings, green infrastructure to manage stormwater, and planning to reduce vulnerability in the most exposed neighbourhoods. Effective responses require combining national policies, international agreements, local action and individual behaviour change, and they must be informed by up-to-date science and well-chosen case studies.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on climate change, begin by making clear the scale and timeframe you are discussing, whether that is recent warming, Quaternary cycles, local UK impacts or global consequences. For “describe” or “explain” questions, link cause and effect directly: describe the evidence, explain what it shows and then outline the processes that produce the observed changes. For evaluation or “assess” questions, compare natural and human causes and judge their relative importance, commenting on the reliability of different types of evidence and using examples to support your judgement. Use specific case studies where the question asks for them — for example, an ice core record or a recent extreme weather event — and make sure each paragraph advances your argument rather than listing facts. When discussing impacts, make explicit links between physical changes (such as rising temperatures or sea level) and human consequences (such as crop yields, insurance costs or migration). For the longer 6–12 mark answers include a clear introduction, developed analysis with evidence and a concluding sentence that answers the question directly. Remember to use correct geographical terms (for example “enhanced greenhouse effect”, “Milankovitch cycles”, “thermal expansion”) and to demonstrate SPaG by writing sentences that are clear and well punctuated. Finally, practise applying numerical and graphical skills where required: interpret small data extracts, draw conclusions from trends and use maps or climate graphs if given in the exam resources.
