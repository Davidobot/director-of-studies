# Climate change, weather systems and hazards (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: why weather systems and climate matter
Weather and climate shape lives, economies and environments at every scale. Weather describes short‑term atmospheric conditions such as rain, wind and temperature, while climate is the long‑term average of those conditions. GCSE geography asks you to understand both the systems that create weather and the longer‑term shifts in climate that are changing the frequency and severity of hazards. These hazards include tropical storms, droughts and flooding, each of which results from interactions between global atmospheric circulation, ocean temperatures and local geography. Being able to explain how processes operate, to use evidence from case studies and to evaluate management responses are key skills for exams and for understanding real world impacts.

## Evidence for past and present climate change
Evidence shows that climate has varied naturally over geological time, with ice ages and warmer intervals, but recent warming is unusually fast and closely linked to human activity. Long‑term records come from proxy sources such as ice cores, which trap air bubbles recording past atmospheric composition and temperature; tree rings, which reflect growth conditions year by year; and historical sources like paintings and ship logs. Instrumental records of global temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are available for the last 150–170 years and show a clear upward trend in temperature coinciding with rising greenhouse gas levels. Natural factors such as volcanic eruptions, changes in Earth’s orbit and variations in solar output have driven past climate change, but the enhanced greenhouse effect is the dominant explanation for modern warming. This enhanced effect occurs because human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, release extra carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap more outgoing longwave radiation and raise global temperatures, which in turn alters weather patterns, sea level and the behaviour of extreme events.

## Global atmospheric circulation and how it controls weather
The atmosphere’s large‑scale circulation patterns move heat and moisture around the planet and explain why different regions have distinct climates. Rising air near the equator in the Intertropical Convergence Zone produces heavy rainfall and supports tropical rainforests. Air that rises there moves polewards aloft, cools and descends around 30° latitude, creating stable, dry conditions and many of the world’s deserts. Between the equator and the poles, mid‑latitude westerlies and associated low‑pressure systems bring variable weather and fronts. The Polar cell and associated cold air masses help create the colder climates of high latitudes. These circulation cells, together with the Coriolis effect from Earth’s rotation, determine the prevailing winds and the paths of weather systems such as depressions that bring rain to the UK. The ocean also plays a major role: warm currents such as the North Atlantic Drift moderate the UK’s climate by bringing heat and moisture from lower latitudes, contributing to milder winters than might be expected at its latitude.

## Tropical storms, droughts and the El Niño Southern Oscillation
Tropical storms (called hurricanes, typhoons or cyclones depending on region) form over warm ocean waters where heat and moisture fuel intense low‑pressure systems. They occur mainly between about 5° and 30° latitude and require a pre‑existing disturbance, high sea surface temperatures, and sufficient Coriolis force to develop rotation. Climate change is expected to influence tropical storms: overall numbers may not rise dramatically, but the intensity of the strongest storms and the amount of rainfall they produce are likely to increase because warmer air holds more moisture.

Drought is another major hazard, involving prolonged water shortage caused by low precipitation, high evaporation, or changes to river flows and groundwater. Large‑scale climate drivers like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) produce significant interannual variability in rainfall. El Niño events, characterised by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific, typically shift tropical rainfall patterns and can cause drought in places such as Indonesia and parts of southern Africa while increasing rainfall and flooding on the Pacific coasts of South America. La Niña tends to produce the opposite pattern. For example, the strong El Niño of 2015–2016 contributed to drought conditions in parts of southern Africa and to coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, illustrating how ocean‑atmosphere coupling can produce far‑reaching impacts.

## Flooding and extreme weather in the UK
The UK is vulnerable to a range of extreme weather because of its maritime position, variable air masses and the influence of the North Atlantic Drift. Flooding in the UK can result from prolonged intense rainfall associated with deep Atlantic depressions, from rapid snowmelt in upland areas, or from coastal storm surges combined with high tides. The December 2015 Storm Desmond brought exceptional rainfall to parts of northwest England and southwest Scotland, producing record river levels and widespread flooding in Cumbria. Contributing factors included a strong Atlantic low bringing warm, moisture‑laden air that produced sustained heavy rain over saturated catchments. Understanding such events requires combining knowledge of synoptic weather patterns, river basin processes and human influences such as urbanisation and land use change that can increase surface runoff. Flood risk is therefore the product of hazard, vulnerability and exposure: where more people and assets sit in floodplains, the potential for harm grows.

## Impacts, adaptation and mitigation: global to local responses
Climate change and related hazards have physical, social and economic impacts that vary between places. Sea level rise threatens low‑lying coastal areas and small island states, altered rainfall patterns affect water supply and agriculture, and extreme heat increases health risks in cities. Responses occur at many scales and fall broadly into adaptation and mitigation. Adaptation reduces vulnerability through measures such as flood defences, improved drainage, land‑use planning that avoids building on floodplains, water conservation and drought‑tolerant crops, and changes to building design for heat resilience. The UK uses a mix of hard engineering (sea walls and embankments) and soft, sustainable approaches (managed realignment and wetland restoration) as part of integrated flood risk management.

Mitigation aims to limit future climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At national and global levels this involves transitioning energy systems away from fossil fuels towards renewables, increasing energy efficiency, and international agreements to cut emissions. The UK’s energy mix has changed markedly in recent decades: coal use has declined while wind and other renewables have grown, although questions remain about energy security, the role of natural gas and the debate around technologies such as fracking. Effective mitigation requires political will, technological innovation and public support, because global warming is driven by cumulative emissions from many countries over long time periods. Both adaptation and mitigation are necessary: adaptation deals with impacts that are already happening or inevitable, while mitigation reduces the scale of future change.

## Applying knowledge: case studies and fieldwork
Successful exam answers draw on specific, contemporary case studies and an awareness of scale. For the drought topic you should be able to explain how a named El Niño event altered sea surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation, link that to rainfall deficits and describe social consequences such as crop failure, water shortages and migration, then discuss local adaptations used by affected communities. For flooding in the UK, a case such as Storm Desmond enables you to link synoptic conditions, catchment processes and the human response, including short‑term emergency measures and longer‑term floodplain management. Fieldwork underpins strong responses to synoptic questions: practical experience of measuring river discharge, mapping floodplain land use or surveying local attitudes to flood risk equips you to interpret unfamiliar data in exams. You will also be expected to use quantitative and cartographic skills, including reading maps and drawing or interpreting graphs, and to apply numerical techniques such as calculating percentage changes, means or rates from given data.

## Exam technique
In exam answers start by clearly defining key terms such as climate change, greenhouse effect, tropical storm or drought to show AO1 knowledge. Use short, focused paragraphs that apply those definitions to the case study or data provided, and make sure you explicitly link cause, process and consequence to demonstrate AO2 and AO3. Where questions ask for evaluation, consider strengths and limitations of evidence, uncertainties and the effectiveness of different management strategies. For extended answers plan a brief structure before you write: an opening sentence that answers the question, two or three developed points with specific evidence and a concluding judgement that synthesises your argument. Use numerical and map skills where appropriate: reference figures from graphs, describe spatial patterns shown on maps and, if asked, show simple calculations with units. When drawing on fieldwork, explain methods, sampling limitations and how results support your conclusions. Remember that examiners reward the use of named, recent case studies and clear, specialist terminology; aim for accuracy in spelling, punctuation and grammar and for precise use of vocabulary such as “atmospheric circulation”, “sea surface temperature”, “runoff” or “managed realignment”. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions, review mark schemes to understand the required level of response for each tariff, and use feedback to improve clarity, depth and the effective use of evidence in your answers.
