# Global hazards: weather and tectonics (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what this topic covers and how to approach it
Global hazards from weather and tectonics are central to understanding our changing planet and the risks people face. At GCSE level you will be expected to explain why extremes of weather and tectonic activity occur, describe their physical causes, and evaluate their social, economic and environmental consequences. You should be able to study hazards at different scales – global patterns, national and regional contexts, and the local impacts on communities – and use case studies to show place-specific causes, consequences and responses. Case studies must be contemporary (21st century) and, for the weather hazard questions, include one UK example and one non-UK example. In addition to factual knowledge, you will be assessed on geographical skills: map interpretation, graph work, using data, fieldwork understanding and the ability to make judgements and propose responses.

## How weather becomes hazardous: global circulation and local triggers
Weather extremes are rooted in the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere and in interactions with oceans, land surfaces and topography. The global circulation system – often described in terms of the Hadley, Ferrel and Polar cells together with high and low pressure belts – helps explain why different regions have characteristic climates and why some places are predisposed to particular hazards. For example, the convergence and uplift near the equator drive strong convective rainfall and fuel tropical storms, while the descending air beneath subtropical highs favours arid conditions and drought in many desert belts.

Local factors modify these broad patterns. Sea surface temperatures, the position of storm tracks, mountain ranges and the configuration of coastlines can concentrate wind, rainfall or drought in particular places. Climate variability such as El Niño and La Niña alters global weather patterns by changing sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific; El Niño is associated in some years with droughts in Australia and parts of southeast Asia and with wetter conditions in parts of South America. Human-induced climate change is also shifting hazard regimes: warmer oceans can increase the energy available to tropical storms and change the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall and heatwaves, so you should be ready to discuss both natural variability and human influence.

## Weather hazards: types, effects and case studies
Weather hazards take many forms, from flash floods and prolonged droughts to heatwaves and tropical cyclones. Flash flooding often follows intense convective storms in areas with steep drainage, impermeable urban surfaces, or saturated soils. Prolonged drought results from persistent rainfall deficits and can devastate water supplies, agriculture and ecosystems. Heatwaves pose direct health risks, strain energy systems and interact with urban heat islands to raise temperatures further. Tropical cyclones (also called hurricanes or typhoons depending on the ocean) bring destructive winds, storm surge and heavy rain.

Exam-focused case studies should explain causes, immediate and longer-term consequences, and responses. For a UK-based weather hazard, you could study a recent flash flood or heatwave. For example, the UK summer heatwave of 2003 led to thousands of excess deaths in Europe and prompted changes in public health readiness; more recent UK flooding events (such as the winter floods that affected parts of England in the 2013–2014 and later storms) illustrate how river overflow, land use and floodplain development combine to produce local damage. For a non-UK example, Typhoon Haiyan (Philippines, 2013) provides a clear narrative of intense wind and storm surge causing catastrophic loss of life and infrastructure, while Cape Town’s 2018 “Day Zero” water crisis is a useful modern drought case showing the social, economic and political consequences of water scarcity. In each case study make sure you can link the physical trigger (e.g., very warm sea surface temperatures, blocking high pressure, or heavy orographic rainfall) to the observed impacts and to the mix of responses: immediate rescue and relief, short-term shelter and aid, and long-term adaptation such as flood defences, improved water management or changes in planning policy.

## Plate tectonics: structure, boundary types and processes
Tectonic hazards arise from the structure and dynamics of the solid Earth. The planet is layered into the crust, mantle and core, with the lithosphere broken into tectonic plates that move relative to one another. Two of the key driving forces often described are slab pull, where dense, sinking plate edges drag plates into subduction zones, and ridge push, where elevated mid-ocean ridges push plates apart. Where plates meet, different boundary types produce characteristic processes. Constructive (divergent) boundaries create new crust and are associated with gentle volcanic eruptions and fissure systems. Destructive (convergent) boundaries, where oceanic crust is forced beneath continental crust or two continental plates collide, produce powerful earthquakes and composite volcanoes. Conservative (transform) boundaries generate strike-slip earthquakes. Hotspots are independent of plate boundaries and can form chains of volcanic islands as a plate moves over a stationary mantle plume.

Earthquake impacts depend on magnitude, focal depth and distance from population centres. Shallow-focus earthquakes tend to be more damaging locally. Volcano type matters for hazard type: shield volcanoes produce fluid lava flows that can travel long distances but are rarely explosive, whereas composite volcanoes can erupt explosively, sending ash clouds, pyroclastic flows and lahars downslope. Understanding these processes helps explain why some regions are prone to frequent, high-impact tectonic events.

## Tectonic hazards: case studies, consequences and responses
For assessments you will need at least one detailed tectonic case study showing causes, consequences and responses. Strong choices include the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which demonstrates how earthquake impact is amplified by poverty, weak building standards and limited emergency capacity, or the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which highlights how even well-prepared, wealthy countries can suffer huge damage and secondary hazards (tsunami, nuclear plant failure) but also how strong building codes and early warning systems reduce casualties. A volcanic example such as the 1985 Armero disaster in Colombia (Nevado del Ruiz) shows how lahars can be deadly when communities settle on volcanic debris flows and when early warnings are not acted upon.

When you describe consequences, separate primary impacts (loss of life, collapse of buildings, lava, ashfall, ground rupture) from secondary effects (disease, economic losses, homelessness, disruption to food supplies, long-term unemployment). Responses fall into immediate relief (search and rescue, emergency shelter), short-term recovery (temporary housing, restoring services) and long-term mitigation and adaptation (retrofit and enforcement of building codes, land-use zoning, hazard mapping and insurance schemes). In evaluations you should always consider how local context—economic resources, governance, public awareness and infrastructure—shapes the effectiveness of any response.

## Technology, monitoring and mitigation: reducing risk and saving lives
Modern technology plays a central role in reducing hazard risk. For tectonic hazards, seismometers, GPS networks and satellite monitoring can detect ground movement and provide crucial data for early warning systems. Volcano observatories monitor gas emissions, ground swelling and seismicity to forecast eruptions. Tsunami warning systems use networks of sea-level gauges and ocean buoys, and can give coastal communities vital minutes to evacuate. In terms of engineering, earthquake-resistant building design—such as base isolation, tuned mass dampers and reinforced concrete standards—has proved highly effective in reducing casualties in earthquake-prone countries. For weather hazards, meteorological satellites, radar and improved global numerical weather prediction allow earlier and more accurate forecasts of storms and heavy rainfall. GIS and remote sensing help map flood risk, land-use change and vulnerable infrastructure so planners can prioritise interventions.

Technology is not a panacea: early warnings must be communicated clearly and acted upon, and simple low-cost measures such as community education, evacuation drills and properly maintained drainage can be as important as high-tech solutions. When discussing “how technology can save lives” in exam answers, explain the technological system, give a specific example of its use, and evaluate limitations like cost, maintenance and the potential for social inequality in access to protective measures.

## Linking hazards to other topics and using geographical skills
Global hazards do not occur in isolation and are linked to other geography themes. Climate change, land-use change, urbanisation and development patterns all influence hazard exposure and vulnerability. Fieldwork and data skills are important: measuring river discharge, analysing rainfall records, interpreting hazard maps and constructing and interpreting graphs are valuable ways to support case study arguments. When planning your revision, practise reading and annotating maps and resource booklets, interpreting climate graphs and population pyramids, and using basic statistics to describe trends. Remember that exam questions will test your ability to apply knowledge (AO3), to use geographical skills (AO4) and to show understanding and factual recall (AO1 and AO2). Use your case studies to provide place-specific evidence, drawing on both primary fieldwork experiences where possible and reliable secondary sources.

## Exam technique
Aim to answer each question with the right balance of description, explanation and judgement. For short answer questions make your point clearly and concisely, using technical terms correctly. For 6-mark questions include two or three developed points: for example, if asked about causes of a flood, explain the weather system responsible and then link to a local factor such as impermeable urban surfaces, each point with explanation and, where possible, a specific example. For the higher-tariff 12-mark extended responses plan a brief paragraph structure before you write: an opening paragraph that defines key terms and outlines the approach, two to three developed paragraphs that address causes, consequences and responses (each illustrated with named case study detail), and a concluding paragraph that makes a reasoned judgement. When 3 SPaG marks are available, write clearly with accurate spelling, punctuation and grammar, and use specialist vocabulary such as “storm surge”, “subduction”, “magnitude”, or “mitigation”. Always place your case study detail in context by naming dates, places and specific impacts or responses rather than vague statements. If a question includes maps, graphs or unfamiliar data, take time to extract the key trends before you start writing: describe what the resource shows, explain reasons, and then evaluate implications. Practise past-paper questions under timed conditions and mark your answers against the assessment objectives: AO1 and AO2 for knowledge and understanding, AO3 for analysis and judgement, and AO4 for skills and techniques. Clear structure, precise use of terminology and well-chosen case study evidence will lift your answers beyond general description to the level examiners are looking for.
