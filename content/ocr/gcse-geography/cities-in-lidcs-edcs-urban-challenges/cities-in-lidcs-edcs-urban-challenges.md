# Cities in LIDCs/EDCs and urban challenges (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## The pace and pattern of urbanisation in LIDCs and EDCs
Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of a country’s population comes to live in towns and cities. Over the last century the majority of new urban growth has taken place in low-income developing countries (LIDCs) and emerging and developing countries (EDCs). Megacities — urban areas with more than 10 million people — are now concentrated in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This rapid expansion is driven by two linked factors: natural increase (high birth rates combined with falling death rates as healthcare improves) and migration from rural areas, attracted by perceived economic opportunities in the city. Globalisation and changing patterns of industry also concentrate jobs, services and investment in certain urban centres, accelerating growth. The result is a very different pattern of urban change from that seen earlier in Europe: instead of slow, managed growth, many cities in LIDCs/EDCs experience very fast, sometimes chaotic, expansion with profound consequences for housing, services and the environment.

## Causes of urban growth and the concept of push and pull
People move to cities for many reasons. “Pull” factors include jobs in manufacturing and services, better education and healthcare, and greater access to markets. Cities in EDCs and LIDCs often act as regional hubs for trade and industry, attracting national and international investment. “Push” factors from the countryside include declining agricultural incomes, lack of rural services and environmental problems such as drought or soil depletion. The speed of migration combined with high natural increase produces intense pressure on housing and infrastructure. In many rapidly growing cities the formal economy cannot provide enough paid work, which leads to expansion of the informal economy — small-scale, often unregulated businesses and services that are a key part of urban livelihoods.

## Housing, informal settlements and their consequences
One of the most visible consequences of rapid urbanisation is the growth of informal settlements, often called slums, favelas or shanty towns depending on the country. These settlements typically develop on land that is cheap or unwanted — river floodplains, steep slopes, or marginal coastal land — and are characterised by overcrowding, insecure tenure, limited access to clean water and sanitation, and poor-quality housing. Examples include Dharavi in Mumbai, Makoko in Lagos, Kibera in Nairobi and many districts across Latin America and South Asia. Although conditions can be harsh, these areas are also centres of intense economic activity and social networks. The lack of formal housing supply and planning enforcement often leaves residents vulnerable to evictions, flooding and fire. The environmental impacts are significant too: erosion, pollution of rivers, and the loss of urban green spaces reduce urban resilience to hazards and climate change.

## Transport, water, sanitation and waste management challenges
Infrastructure struggles to keep pace with population growth. Transport systems are frequently congested, unreliable and unsafe, with long commutes that reduce quality of life and productivity. Informal transport modes — minibuses, motorcycle taxis and shared rickshaws — fill gaps but can be inefficient and hazardous. Water supply and sanitation are major problems in many LIDCs/EDCs. Piped water may be intermittent or unavailable, and sewerage systems are often incomplete, increasing risk of waterborne disease. Solid waste collection may not reach informal areas, causing litter, blocked drains and pollution that contribute to flooding and health problems. Some cities have begun to respond: rapid bus transit systems like Bogotá’s TransMilenio provide a high-capacity, low-cost alternative to private cars and can be replicated; decentralised water kiosks and community sanitation projects have been used successfully in parts of Africa and South Asia. However, these improvements require investment, political will and careful planning.

## Social, cultural and economic life in expanding cities
Cities in LIDCs and EDCs are places of cultural diversity, creativity and economic possibility. Migration brings together a range of ethnic groups, languages and traditions, which can enrich urban life through diverse food, music and cultural practices. At the same time, social inequality can be sharp. The contrast between affluent gated communities and adjacent informal settlements is dramatic in many cities. Access to education, healthcare and formal employment tends to be unequally distributed, which can fuel social tensions. The informal economy plays an essential role: street vendors, small workshops and home-based enterprises provide livelihoods for millions and contribute disproportionately to the urban economy, even if they remain outside formal regulation and taxation.

## Environmental hazards, health risks and climate pressures
Rapid urban growth increases vulnerability to environmental hazards. Many expanding cities are on coastlines or floodplains; land subsidence, sea-level rise and extreme rainfall events increase risk of flooding. Air pollution from vehicles, industry and domestic burning is a major health issue in many EDCs and LIDCs, contributing to respiratory disease and premature deaths. Waste mismanagement contaminates water sources and breeding grounds for disease vectors. Informal settlements are often the least protected from these hazards, with limited access to healthcare and emergency services. Climate change compounds these problems: extreme heat, more intense storms and shifting rainfall patterns all place additional strain on water, energy and food systems in densely populated urban areas.

## Strategies for sustainable urban development and their limits
A range of strategies has been used to manage urban challenges, from top‑down infrastructure projects to community-led improvements. Slum upgrading programmes attempt to improve housing, provide secure tenure, extend services and pave roads while keeping communities in place, with notable examples such as the Favela Bairro programme in Rio de Janeiro. Affordable housing projects and policies to densify serviced land aim to reduce the growth of new informal settlements. Public transport solutions, including bus rapid transit, metro expansion and promotion of non-motorised transport, tackle congestion and pollution. Waste recycling schemes, decentralised sanitation and rainwater harvesting are examples of locally appropriate interventions. Yet each strategy faces limits: financing is often inadequate, land tenure conflicts can block redevelopment, and large infrastructure projects sometimes prioritize elite areas or fail to reach informal neighbourhoods. Successful approaches usually combine investment with community participation, ensuring that residents’ needs shape planning and that benefits reach the most vulnerable.

## Case study focus: Lagos (Nigeria) as an example of urban challenges and responses
Lagos illustrates many of the themes above. Once the capital of Nigeria, Lagos has grown into one of Africa’s largest megacities, driven by migration and economic opportunities linked to oil, trade and services. The city’s expansion includes high-rise developments and massive informal settlements such as Makoko, a stilted community on the lagoon. Lagos faces severe congestion, inadequate public transport, flooding (exacerbated by settlement on low-lying land and blocked drainage), and solid waste management difficulties. In response, city planners and developers have pursued large-scale projects such as the Lekki-Epe corridor and Eko Atlantic, a reclaimed land development aimed at commercial and residential growth, alongside more grassroots initiatives. Community-led sanitation improvements, pilot waste recycling programmes and attempts to formalise informal transport have all sought to improve living conditions. The Lagos example shows the tension between rapid, market-driven development and the need for inclusive, resilient urban planning that protects low-income residents and the environment.

## Fieldwork and skills: linking classroom study to real urban enquiry
Studying urban challenges lends itself well to practical fieldwork and the development of geographical skills. A practical urban transect across a town or city can allow students to record changes in land use, housing quality, access to services and environmental quality. Surveys of residents’ perceptions of quality of life, traffic counts to quantify congestion, and sampling of water quality or litter audits are all appropriate investigations. Skills in map interpretation, constructing and analysing graphs, using population pyramids and creating choropleth maps help to summarise and communicate findings. Fieldwork also supports evaluation: comparing primary data with secondary sources enables learners to assess the reliability of evidence and to reach reasoned conclusions about causes, consequences and the success of different management strategies.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on cities in LIDCs/EDCs, begin by quickly identifying the command word (for example, “describe”, “explain”, “assess” or “evaluate”) and the required focus — causes, consequences, or strategies. For short questions, select clear, precise facts and, where possible, include a named example such as Lagos, Mumbai or Rio to move answers from generic to specific. For 6‑mark questions aim to make two developed points, each containing a reason and an example. For higher tariff and extended response questions (9–12 marks), structure your answer with a short introduction that defines key terms, a series of developed paragraphs that link causes to consequences or compare different viewpoints, and a brief conclusion that reaches a judgement about the relative importance or effectiveness of the ideas discussed. Use geographical terminology accurately to meet the AO1 and AO2 requirements, analyse data and unseen resources carefully for AO3, and apply appropriate skills such as map interpretation or basic statistics to demonstrate AO4. Remember to reference your case study details — dates, place names and specific impacts — and in longer answers to evaluate the success and limitations of management strategies rather than simply listing them. Finally, spend a minute checking spelling, punctuation and specialist terms, since clear expression supports higher marks.
