# Distinctive UK landscapes: coasts and rivers (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

Distinctive landscapes in the UK are the result of physical processes operating over different scales of time and space and of the interaction between natural systems and human activity. Coastal and fluvial environments are particularly dynamic: waves, tides and longshore drift sculpt the shoreline, while rainfall, runoff and channel processes shape river valleys from source to mouth. Understanding the landforms found in these environments requires not only knowledge of the processes involved but also the ability to relate those processes to local geology, climate and human choices. The following sections summarise the key ideas you need to revise for the OCR GCSE Geography B topic on distinctive landscapes, with clear explanations, two linked UK case studies and guidance on fieldwork and exam technique.

## How geomorphic processes make landscapes distinctive

Landscapes become distinctive because of the balance of erosion, transport and deposition and the way these processes are affected by rock type, structure and climate. On coasts, wave energy and tidal range determine whether material is removed, moved alongshore or deposited as beaches and spits. Mechanical and chemical weathering weaken cliffs, while mass movement transfers large volumes of material downslope. In rivers, the steep gradients and turbulent flow of upland streams encourage vertical erosion and valley deepening, producing V-shaped valleys, interlocking spurs and waterfalls. As rivers reach gentler slopes they lose energy; lateral erosion, deposition on point bars and floodplain development lead to meanders, ox-bow lakes and levees. Throughout both environments the supply of sediment, the resistance of bedrock, and changes in sea level or climate control how landforms develop. To describe landscapes well in exams, link each landform to the specific process that created it and explain how local geology and weather made that process effective.

## Coastal landforms and why they form: the processes behind headlands, bays, caves and spits

Coastal landforms follow from the way waves interact with the shore. Where alternating bands of hard and soft rock line the coast, differential erosion creates headlands of resistant rock and bays where softer rocks retreat more quickly. Wave-cut platforms and cliffs form by repeated hydraulic action and abrasion at the base of cliffs; when lines of weakness are exploited caves can form and, with continued erosion, evolve into arches and then stacks. Beaches are deposits of sand and shingle shaped by the angle of waves and beach gradient; spits form where longshore drift transports sediment past a change in coastline direction and deposition builds out into open water. Factors that influence these processes include rock type and jointing, the fetch (the distance over which waves have travelled), and storminess. Sea level change and human activity—such as coastal defences—also alter the balance between erosion and deposition, sometimes accelerating change elsewhere along the coastline.

## Case study – The Holderness coast: rapid erosion, management choices and consequences

The Holderness coast on the east coast of England is one of the fastest-eroding coastlines in Europe and a vital example for understanding coastal processes and human responses. Underlain by boulder clay (glacial till), the cliffs are easily eroded by winter storm waves which attack the base, causing collapse. Average rates of erosion are often quoted as around 1.5–2 metres per year along much of the coast, although rates vary locally and episodic storms have caused much larger single-event losses. Longshore drift moves the eroded sediment southwards; material transported along the coast helps build spits such as Spurn Head at the Humber, a shifting feature shaped by tides and strong currents.

Human responses along Holderness vary from hard defences at towns like Hornsea and Bridlington—sea walls and groynes built to protect housing and infrastructure—to areas where defences are absent and farmland is lost. Groynes trap beach material and can protect a local stretch of coast, but they starve downdrift beaches of sediment, increasing erosion elsewhere. Managed realignment has been adopted in places as a strategic choice where defending the coastline is no longer cost-effective, allowing some areas to flood to create salt marshes that can absorb wave energy. The Holderness example illustrates the need to weigh economic value, environmental impact and sustainability when choosing coastal management, and it is ideal for exam answers because it shows the links between geology, processes, landforms and human decision-making.

## River landforms and why they form: waterfalls, meanders, floodplains and ox-bow lakes

Rivers display a classic sequence of landforms from source to mouth. In the upper course, steep gradients and high energy result in vertical erosion by hydraulic action and abrasion; this is where waterfalls and v-shaped valleys form. A waterfall typically occurs where a resistant cap rock overlies weaker strata. Over time the plunge pool at the base deepens and the waterfall retreats upstream, leaving a gorge. In the middle course, reduced gradient increases lateral erosion and transportation dominates, producing meanders. Erosion on the outside of bends and deposition on the inside make point bars and eventually may lead to meander cut-off, creating ox-bow lakes. In the lower course, deposition builds wide floodplains and levees. River processes are influenced by geology, catchment size, land use and climate; heavy rainfall and impermeable surfaces increase run-off and the likelihood of floods, while vegetation and soil structure can slow flows and encourage infiltration.

## Case study – The River Tees: upland energy, waterfall formation and human impacts downstream

The River Tees in north-east England provides a clear, compact example of how a river system changes across its course. Rising in the Pennines, the Tees flows over varied geology that helps create distinctive upland features. High Force, the Tees’ best-known waterfall, demonstrates the classic waterfall mechanism: a hard dolerite (whinstone) cap rock sits above softer carboniferous rocks. The differential erosion beneath the cap rock has created a plunge pool and a waterfall approximately 21 metres high; continued erosion has formed a short gorge downstream. Further downstream the river gradient lessens and the Tees develops meanders and a floodplain before entering the wide estuary near Middlesbrough and Stockton where human activity is concentrated.

Human influences on the Tees include historical industrialisation, channel modification, and flood defences designed to protect towns and port infrastructure. Urbanisation and changes in land use in the catchment have altered runoff characteristics, increasing flood risk in some reaches. More recently, interest in river restoration, riparian planting and the use of upstream storage measures reflect a move towards softer engineering and integrated catchment management. In exams, the Tees is a good case study to show how physical processes (waterfall formation, gorge development, meandering) are linked to geology and how human actions downstream can change the river’s behaviour and require management.

## Human activity, management strategies and sustainability

Distinctive landscapes are not only the product of natural processes; human choices shape them too. Coastal management ranges from hard engineering—sea walls, revetments, groynes and rock armour—that protect assets but often transfer erosion problems elsewhere, to soft engineering such as beach nourishment, dune restoration and managed retreat which work with natural processes. Decision-making about defences is guided by economic appraisal, risk, environmental impact and social values: defended towns and infrastructure are often prioritised over low-value farmland. For rivers, flood management traditionally used hard structures like levees and channel straightening to convey water rapidly away from settlements. Contemporary approaches increasingly combine such measures with upstream land management, re-meandering, floodplain reconnection and sustainable urban drainage systems to reduce peak flows and restore natural flood storage. When evaluating management in exam answers, always consider short-term effectiveness, long-term sustainability, environmental consequences and who benefits or loses from a chosen strategy.

## Fieldwork, skills and ways to study landscapes

Fieldwork is central to understanding coasts and rivers because it links theory to observable evidence. At the coast, useful fieldwork techniques include measuring cliff profiles and retreat using GPS or tape, sampling sediment size and sorting on the foreshore, and surveying beach shape and cross-sections to understand sediment budgets. Along rivers, measuring channel width and depth to calculate cross-sectional area, timing float or flow velocity over a set distance to estimate discharge (Q = A × v), and mapping channel features gives practical insights into process and energy. Both environments are suitable for sketching landforms, taking photographs for later analysis, and using map skills to relate local observations to broader regional patterns. Skills in interpreting graphs, calculating averages and ranges, and using GIS to present spatial data are all assessed in the specification, so practice presenting and analysing field results, drawing conclusions with reference to both your data and wider theory, and reflecting on method limitations and improvements.

## Exam technique

To score highly in questions about distinctive landscapes, always structure answers to link process, evidence and place. Start by defining key terms in clear specialist language—for example explain hydraulic action, abrasion or longshore drift for coastal questions, and hydraulic action, attrition or meander migration for river questions. When asked about processes, explain the mechanism and then give place-specific detail from your case study: describe how boulder clay geology contributes to rapid erosion at Holderness, or how a dolerite cap rock at High Force causes a waterfall on the Tees. For describe-and-explain questions use causal chains that show how one process leads to another (for example, wave attack weakens cliffs → cliff collapse adds sediment to the beach → longshore drift transports sediment and builds a spit). When discussing management, balance short-term benefits against long-term sustainability and environmental consequences and refer to specific examples of defences, their costs and their effects on adjacent areas. For higher-tariff and extended responses integrate theory and evidence from both the coastal and river contexts, evaluate alternative strategies, and end with a justified conclusion that answers the question directly. Use annotated diagrams where helpful, include data and fieldwork findings when available, and make sure your spelling, punctuation and specialist terminology are accurate to secure the SPaG marks.
