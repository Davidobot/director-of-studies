# Geographical skills and fieldwork (maps, stats, GIS) (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: why skills matter in OCR J384 Geography B
Geographical skills are the practical backbone of OCR’s GCSE Geography B (J384). Across the three externally assessed components — Our Natural World, People and Society, and Geographical Exploration — you are expected not only to know places and processes, but to use maps, statistics, graphs and fieldwork evidence to investigate, explain and judge real-world issues. Around 10% of the whole qualification explicitly assesses mathematical and statistical skills, and each paper contains questions that will test your ability to apply quantitative and cartographic techniques to unfamiliar resources. Fieldwork is embedded into the specification: centres must offer learners at least two opportunities to undertake fieldwork in contrasting locations, covering both physical and human environments, and a written statement about those opportunities must be submitted to OCR. The emphasis is on thinking like a geographer — using evidence, methods and critical reflection to reach well-evidenced conclusions.

## Cartographic skills: reading and using maps effectively
Cartographic competence begins with an understanding of scale, coordinates and how to move between map and ground. You should be confident using large-scale Ordnance Survey maps (1:50 000 and 1:25 000), atlas maps and a range of thematic maps such as choropleth, flow-line and proportional symbol maps. Knowing how to convert distances using scale, how to locate places with grid references and how to read contour lines, spot heights and gradients is essential. When asked to interpret relief or derive slope steepness from contour spacing you will need to explain the relationship between contour intervals and gradient and may be expected to sketch simple cross-sections or transects to show profile changes. In exam questions you will often be given an unfamiliar map in the Resource Booklet: annotate it, refer to exact features, quote distances or gradients where appropriate and use correct place-scale language (local, regional, national, global) to show your geographical precision.

## Graphical and numerical skills: presenting and analysing data
A wide variety of graphs and charts can appear in both questions and resource materials, so you should be practiced at creating and interpreting bar charts, line graphs, histograms, pie charts, scatter plots with lines of best fit, population pyramids, radial and rose diagrams, and climate graphs. Make sure your graphs have clear axes, labelled units, sensible scales and a title that explains what is being plotted. Statistically, you will be expected to use measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, mode, range, quartiles and inter‑quartile range) and to calculate and interpret percentages and percentage change. For bivariate data, being able to sketch an estimated trend line, describe the strength and direction of a relationship and make cautious interpolation or extrapolation is important. Show your workings where calculations are required; examiners award method marks as well as final answers, and clear numerical working increases your credibility in analysis questions.

## Fieldwork planning and practical techniques
Fieldwork in this specification is both a learning experience and an assessed requirement. Fieldwork must be conducted outside the classroom, beyond school grounds, on at least two occasions and in contrasting environments that include both human and physical contexts. Good fieldwork starts from a clear enquiry question and a testable hypothesis. Sampling design is crucial: decide whether random sampling, systematic transects, stratified sampling or purposive sampling best answers your question, and justify your choice. Practical techniques vary by enquiry but common physical methods include measuring channel width and depth, flow velocity, pebble size (using a gravelometer or the modified Wentworth scale), infiltration rate and soil pH; common human methods include land-use surveys, questionnaires, pedestrian counts and environmental quality assessments. Accuracy, repeat measurements, calibration of instruments and consideration of sample size all strengthen your data. Think about safety, ethical consent for questionnaires, and contingency plans for bad weather so you can explain limitations later in your report.

## Processing, presentation and evaluation of fieldwork data
Collecting data is only the start: how you process and present it determines how persuasive your conclusions will be. Raw measurements should be summarised with appropriate statistics and presented using suitable graphs or maps; for example, use a scatter plot to explore relationships, a histogram to show frequency distributions of pebble size, or a choropleth map to display survey results across a neighbourhood. GIS and simple spatial analysis can add powerful visual layers, such as overlaying elevation with land-use or flood risk with population density to support an argument. Analysis should link patterns to geographical explanations: relate observed gradients to geology or human processes, discuss temporal variations, and draw conclusions that answer your original question. Equally important is critical evaluation: identify weaknesses in your methods, sources of random or systematic error, how representative your sample was, and propose realistic improvements or further investigations. Examiners expect reflective comment on data quality and reliability, so an honest evaluation boosts marks.

## Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing
GIS is a digital tool for capturing, storing and analysing spatial data, and it is explicitly included in the specification. In practice, GIS enables layering of data types — such as roads, elevation, land use, flood extents or census statistics — to reveal patterns and support decisions. For example, a flood management decision could use GIS to combine flood hazard maps with population and property datasets to identify priority areas for defences or evacuation planning. Remote sensing, including satellite imagery and aerial photography, provides up-to-date information about land-cover change, urban expansion or vegetation health; learning to interpret spectral signatures, seasonal differences and resolution limitations will help when you are asked to evaluate sources. In your answers, describe the advantages of GIS and remote sensing (speed, ability to update, multi-layer analysis) and their limitations (cost, resolution, need for ground-truthing and possible data bias). Being able to interpret simple GIS outputs and suggest how they inform decisions is often rewarded in synoptic questions.

## Linking skills to assessment and SPaG expectations
Skills are assessed across all three papers and are frequently set in unfamiliar contexts using the Resource Booklet. The Geographical Exploration component is synoptic and will routinely require you to bring together knowledge and skills from both natural and human topics, so practise transferring methods and concepts between contexts. Remember that examiners will award three marks per paper for Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPaG) and the correct use of specialist terminology. That means your extended responses should be structured, use paragraphs, include appropriate geographical vocabulary such as “interfluve”, “mitigation”, “urban sprawl” or “inter-quartile range”, and have accurate spelling to secure those marks. The specification also requires a minimum of 10% of marks to assess mathematics in geography, so make sure your numerical answers are neat, labelled and supported by units and explanations.

## Exam technique
When you sit any J384 paper, start by reading the whole paper and the Resource Booklet carefully. Annotate maps and figures in the booklet: draw north lines, mark distances and label key features before you begin answering. For map and skills questions, always quote evidence from the resource and use specific terms such as “grid reference”, “contour interval”, “mean” or “correlation” rather than vague language. Show all calculations and label axes and units on graphs; examiners can award method marks even if the final number is slightly off. For fieldwork questions, briefly describe your enquiry question, justify your sampling strategy, explain how you ensured accuracy and reliability, and link findings to geographical theory or case study knowledge. In decision-making or synoptic tasks, weigh up alternatives using evidence, discuss likely short- and long-term impacts and use GIS or map evidence where appropriate to support your recommendation. In extended answers, plan a short structure—introduction to the issue, analysis with evidence, considered judgement and a concluding sentence that answers the question directly. Finally, leave time to proofread for SPaG and to ensure specialist terms are used correctly; clear expression and disciplined structure often make the difference between a good answer and a top‑band answer.
