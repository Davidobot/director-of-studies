# Resource reliance and food security (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why resource reliance matters
Our modern world depends on three essential resources: food, energy and water. How societies obtain, distribute and use these resources shapes economies, environments and daily life. Resource reliance describes the ways people depend on natural systems and the technologies that extract, move and process what the planet provides. For geography students, this topic brings together physical processes, human decisions and ethical questions. It asks whether the Earth’s supplies can keep pace with demand, how access is distributed between rich and poor, and what strategies are being used to avoid shortages and environmental collapse. Understanding resource reliance is also central to the question posed for the 21st century: can we feed a projected nine billion people by 2050?

## Demand outstripping supply: drivers and environmental impacts
Demand for resources has grown because of population increase, rising incomes, changing diets and technological advances. As more people move into middle-income lifestyles, consumption of resource-intensive foods—meat and processed products—rises. Mechanisation, commercial fishing and large-scale irrigation have boosted production, but they have also changed environments. Forests are cleared for cropland or biofuel plantations, mining to extract fossil fuels and minerals damages habitats, and water is stored in reservoirs or transferred between basins to supply cities and farms. These activities increase short-term supply but create long-term problems: soil erosion and degradation from intensive farming, overfishing and collapsing stocks, pollution from fertilisers and pesticides, and the loss of biodiversity. When natural capital is eroded, the resilience of food and water systems declines, making them more vulnerable to climate extremes and human pressures.

## What food security means and how it is measured
Food security is not just having enough calories produced in a country. It is a multi-dimensional concept covering availability, access, utilization and stability. Availability refers to the supply of food through domestic production, imports and food aid. Access means that people have the economic and physical means to obtain food; utilization covers the nutritional quality and safe preparation of food; and stability describes the reliability of supply over time, including protection against shocks. Geographers use a variety of measures to study food security. Maps of average daily calorie consumption, the World Hunger Index, undernourishment rates and national food balance statistics all give different perspectives. Interpreting these indicators requires attention to scale: a nation may be food-secure in aggregate while large groups within it remain food-insecure because of poverty, conflict or poor infrastructure.

## Causes of food insecurity and contrasting theories
Physical factors that influence food security include climate, soil fertility, water availability and the frequency of hazards such as droughts and floods. Human factors include economic development, political stability, trade policies, infrastructure and technology. Two classic theories offer contrasting lenses. Thomas Malthus argued that population growth would outstrip food production, leading to scarcity unless checks such as famine or reduced fertility occurred. Ester Boserup offered a more optimistic view, arguing that population pressure stimulates innovation and intensification of agriculture: people adopt new techniques to produce more food. Both perspectives have relevance today. In some contexts high population and weak institutions lead to stress on resources, while in other situations technological advances—irrigation, high-yield varieties and mechanisation—have dramatically increased yields. The key is to evaluate both ideas against evidence from particular countries and to consider distributional and environmental constraints that may limit technological fixes.

## Examples and case studies: how countries and communities respond
Case studies help turn abstract concepts into lived reality. The Green Revolution of the mid-20th century transformed food production in countries such as Mexico and India by introducing high-yielding cereal varieties, fertilisers and irrigation. It reduced famine risk and raised caloric availability, but also brought environmental costs such as increased water use and soil salinisation, and it often favoured wealthier farmers who could afford inputs. In contrast, modern technological solutions include genetically modified (GM) crops in the United States and Argentina that can increase yields and pest resistance, and precision agriculture in the Netherlands that combines data and controlled environments to boost productivity with fewer inputs. Small-scale, bottom-up initiatives also play a vital role. Urban gardens, allotments and community food banks improve local access in cities, reduce food miles and can strengthen social capital. Urban vertical farms and hydroponics in places with little arable land, such as Singapore, demonstrate how technology and design can deliver fresh produce close to consumers. When choosing case studies for assessment, ensure they are contemporary and that you can explain causes, consequences and responses at the appropriate scale.

## Evaluating sustainability: trade-offs and future options
Any attempt to increase food security must be judged for environmental, economic and social sustainability. Intensification often raises yields but can degrade ecosystems. Deforestation to expand cropland may increase short-term production while reducing long-term resilience through lost carbon sinks, reduced rainfall recycling and biodiversity loss. Trade can help countries import calories they cannot produce, but over-reliance on global markets can create vulnerability to price spikes and geopolitical disruption. Technology offers many options: GM crops may reduce pesticide use or improve nutrition, but they raise concerns about biodiversity, corporate control of seeds and social acceptability. Agroecological approaches, conservation agriculture and permaculture seek to boost productivity while restoring soil health and biodiversity. Ethical consumerism, including fair trade and reductions in food waste, addresses social and economic sustainability by ensuring producers receive fair returns and reducing the pressure to expand production. The concept of the water-energy-food nexus is useful here: solutions in one domain affect the others, so integrated planning is essential. For example, irrigation increases food production but consumes energy and water; biofuel expansion can compete with food crops for land. Sustainable pathways will need a mix of policy choices, technological innovation, local initiatives and behaviour change.

## Fieldwork, skills and classroom activities to deepen understanding
Resource reliance and food security lend themselves to practical, enquiry-based learning that develops geographical skills. Students can carry out a food waste audit at school or map local food outlets to identify food deserts and patterns of access. Visiting a farm or community allotment reveals production methods and the social organisation of food. Analysing time-series graphs of national food production, constructing food balance sheets, and interpreting population pyramids allow practice in numerical and statistical skills required by the specification. GIS can be used to map agricultural land use, water-stress regions or flows of food imports and exports. When preparing for case-study questions, practise writing concise place-specific causes, describing consequences with evidence, and explaining responses with evaluation. In fieldwork write-ups, focus not only on data collection but on reflecting critically about methods, sample size and reliability, and on linking findings to wider concepts such as sustainability and equity.

## Exam technique
Examinations assess a blend of knowledge, understanding, application, analysis and geographical skills. For shorter questions, focus on answering the command word directly: if asked to outline, give a brief, clear account; if asked to describe, structure sentences to present key features with an example where possible. For 6-mark questions, aim for two or three developed points that include clear reasoning and where appropriate, short specific evidence from a case study. For extended responses of 9–12 marks, structure answers with an introduction that defines terms and sets out a line of argument, followed by balanced paragraphs that develop points with evidence, analysis and evaluation, and finish with a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Always integrate case study material: name the place, give relevant facts or trends, show how those facts support your argument and evaluate limitations or counter-arguments.

When questions assess fieldwork skills, be ready to explain chosen methods, discuss data reliability, and interpret results using appropriate graphical or statistical measures. Use measures of central tendency and spread where relevant, describe relationships in bivariate data, and sketch or interpret trend lines thoughtfully. For synoptic questions and decision-making exercises, identify clear criteria for judgement, weigh advantages and disadvantages of options, and make a reasoned recommendation that refers to economic, environmental and social factors and to stakeholders affected.

Time management is crucial. Allocate roughly one minute per mark for short answer work and proportionally more for extended responses, leaving a few minutes to proofread for spelling, punctuation and grammar. Use specialist terminology accurately—terms like food security, Green Revolution, hydroponics, yield, access, availability and water-energy-food nexus will help demonstrate understanding and contribute to SPaG marks. Finally, practise answering past-style questions under timed conditions, use your case studies across different question types to build flexibility, and always link local examples to global patterns where appropriate.
