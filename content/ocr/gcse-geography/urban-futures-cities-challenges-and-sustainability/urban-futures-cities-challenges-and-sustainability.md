# Urban futures: cities, challenges and sustainability (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why urban futures matter
Cities are where most people now live, where economies concentrate, and where many of the world’s biggest environmental and social challenges are being played out. The study of urban futures asks how and why cities are changing, what life is like in different kinds of city, and how places can be made more sustainable for the future. At GCSE level this topic links local, national and global scales: you will examine patterns of urban growth, the causes and consequences of urbanisation, compare life in a city in an advanced country with a city in a lower-income or emerging country, and evaluate strategies designed to make cities fairer and greener. Fieldwork and geographical skills are integral to understanding the real lived experience behind statistics and maps.

## Global patterns of urbanisation and why they are changing
Urbanisation is the long-term movement of people from rural to urban places and the growth of towns and cities. Since 1950 there has been a rapid rise in both the number and size of large cities. A megacity is usually defined as a city of over 10 million people; world cities (or global cities) such as London, New York and Tokyo act as international hubs for finance, culture and decision-making. Growth is fastest in low-income developing countries (LIDCs) and emerging and developing countries (EDCs), where limited economic opportunities in the countryside, population growth and higher birth rates combine with strong pull factors of jobs and services in the city. Push factors such as drought, poor harvests or conflict can force people into cities, while pull factors include the promise of work, education and healthcare. Natural increase (the difference between births and deaths) also contributes to urban growth, especially where young people of working age settle in cities and start families.

Patterns of urban growth vary with development level. In advanced countries (ACs) many cities have stable or slowly growing populations and may be experiencing suburbanisation or counter-urbanisation. In contrast, many cities in LIDCs and EDCs grow very quickly, often outpacing the capacity of infrastructure and services and producing unplanned settlements or informal housing.

## Causes and consequences: processes that shape urban life
Urban change is driven by economic restructuring, demographic shifts and global connections. The shift from manufacturing to services in many ACs has changed urban economies and land use, concentrating high-paid jobs in city centres and business districts. In LIDCs and EDCs rapid industrialisation, rural–urban migration and informal employment sectors shape cities differently: while cities offer opportunity, they also create stark inequalities.

Consequences of rapid urban growth include housing shortages, the growth of informal settlements (slums), traffic congestion, air and water pollution, and pressure on basic services such as water supply, sanitation and healthcare. Informal settlements often lack secure land tenure, reliable electricity and sanitation, exposing residents to health risks and insecurity. At the same time cities can generate innovation, cultural diversity and economies of scale for services: dense populations can make public transport, cultural amenities and specialised healthcare viable.

Understanding these causes and consequences requires recognising scale. Global processes such as international investment and migration interact with national policies and local planning decisions to produce very different urban outcomes.

## Comparing cities: life in an AC city and an LIDC/EDC city (case-study approach)
A useful way to learn this topic is by studying two contrasting cities: one in an advanced country and one in an emerging or lower-income country. These studies should include the city’s location and importance, migration patterns, the ways of life found there, the main challenges people face, and one initiative in each city aimed at improving sustainability.

For an AC case study, London illustrates many relevant themes. Located on the River Thames, London is a world city with global financial, cultural and political importance. Migration—both international and from other parts of the UK—has shaped its population, making it ethnically diverse with a range of housing types from inner-city terraces to suburban estates. Key contemporary challenges include housing affordability and shortages, transport congestion and air quality, and social inequality between prosperous areas and neighbourhoods with high unemployment or low incomes. Responses in London include brownfield redevelopment (for example, the regeneration of the Docklands and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park), transport measures such as the congestion charge and expansion of rapid transit, and policies to increase affordable housing, though critics argue that demand still outstrips supply.

An LIDC/EDC example such as Mumbai shows contrasting pressures. Mumbai is India’s financial and commercial hub, attracting migrants in large numbers. The city contains both high-rise business districts and extensive informal settlements, including the dense and economically active area known as Dharavi. Many residents work in the informal economy—small-scale recycling, manufacturing and services—without formal contracts or social protections. Challenges in Mumbai include overcrowded public transport, inadequate sanitation and waste disposal in some neighbourhoods, flood risk during the monsoon, and stark inequality. Attempts to improve conditions have included slum upgrading projects, local sewer and drainage improvements, and debates over redevelopment schemes that seek to balance housing needs with preservation of livelihoods.

Using these kinds of paired case studies helps you compare causes, consequences and responses at different levels and develop a balanced argument about what makes a city sustainable.

## Urban challenges in detail: social, economic and environmental issues
Social challenges in cities include housing affordability, homelessness, health inequalities and access to education and services. Economic challenges involve providing employment, managing informal sectors and ensuring that economic growth benefits a wide cross-section of residents. Environmental challenges include pollution of air and water, waste management, the urban heat island effect and vulnerability to climate change–related hazards like floods and sea-level rise.

Transport is a central issue because poor transport links increase congestion, emissions and travel times, especially for low-income residents commuting to work. Waste disposal can overwhelm municipal systems; informal recycling economies often emerge in response but can pose health risks. Climate risk is significant in many coastal and riverine cities where sea-level rise, storm surges and extreme rainfall threaten infrastructure and communities. Planning decisions, such as allowing construction in flood-prone areas, can worsen vulnerability.

Addressing these challenges requires integrated thinking: social policies must be combined with infrastructure investment and environmental planning. It also requires recognising trade-offs, such as between rapid redevelopment that displaces vulnerable communities and slower, participatory upgrading that keeps communities in place while improving services.

## Making cities sustainable: strategies and successful examples
Sustainable urban development means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. Strategies span planning, technology, governance and community action. Land-use planning can prioritise brownfield redevelopment to protect greenfield areas and reduce urban sprawl. Public transport investments such as bus rapid transit (BRT) systems, tram or metro expansion reduce reliance on private cars, lower emissions and improve accessibility. Congestion charging and low-emission zones can reduce central-city traffic and improve air quality. Green infrastructure—parks, wetlands and green roofs—can mitigate urban heat and manage stormwater. Energy-efficient building standards and incentives for renewable energy cut emissions and long-term costs.

Examples show what is possible. Curitiba in Brazil is well known for its integrated BRT system and land-use planning that focused growth around transport corridors, creating efficient movement and accessible services. Medellín in Colombia combined social urbanism with transport investments—including cable cars and escalators—that linked marginalised neighbourhoods to the city and invested in public spaces and libraries, improving quality of life and social inclusion. In ACs, London’s congestion charge and expansion of cycling and walking infrastructure demonstrate demand-management and modal shift approaches. In many LIDCs, community-led projects and small-scale “bottom-up” solutions—local waste recycling cooperatives, urban gardens and rainwater harvesting—provide resilient, low-cost improvements that also build social capital.

Sustainable urban policies work best when they combine top-down investment with community engagement, protect livelihoods, and are tailored to local social and economic conditions. New technologies such as GIS, smart sensors and data-driven planning can support these strategies but must be used alongside participatory governance to avoid increasing inequality.

## Fieldwork and skills for studying urban futures
Fieldwork is invaluable for understanding urban issues because it links theory to lived experience. Good urban fieldwork questions might investigate patterns of land use, access to services, traffic flows, air quality or perceptions of place. Techniques include land-use mapping, transects from the city centre to suburbs, traffic counts, noise or particulate measurements, questionnaires and interviews. Processing the data involves constructing and interpreting maps, graphs and population profiles, using measures of central tendency and describing trends in bivariate data. Fieldwork should be carried out in contrasting urban settings—such as a central business district and a residential suburb—to explore differences in function and quality of life.

When you design fieldwork remember to consider sample size, the reliability of measurements and ethical issues when interviewing residents. Use your findings to connect local patterns to wider processes of urban change: for example, a rapid increase in apartment blocks might reflect demand from a growing young workforce and link to wider regional migration patterns.

## Exam technique
Begin every answer by thinking about the command word and planning a clear structure. For short-answer questions focus on precise definitions and concise use of key terminology (for example, define “megacity” or “informal settlement” and give a specific example). In 6-mark questions develop two or three linked points with evidence, showing cause–effect relationships and referring to a named case study where appropriate. For extended responses (9–12 marks) use a clear introduction, develop balanced paragraphs that evaluate causes, consequences and responses, and conclude with a judgement that addresses the question directly.

Always include place-specific detail in longer answers: names, dates or specific initiatives strengthen your argument. When comparing AC and LIDC/EDC cities make explicit reference to scale (global, national, regional, local) and contrast processes such as the different roles of migration, natural increase and economic change. For decision-making or evaluative questions weigh advantages and disadvantages of strategies and consider their sustainability in social, economic and environmental terms.

Demonstrate geographical skills by interpreting maps, graphs and data in the question, integrating fieldwork evidence where relevant. Manage your time: allocate time pro rata to the marks available, and spend a few minutes planning high-tariff answers. For the extended SPaG-marked questions write clearly, check spelling of key terms and use specialist vocabulary correctly. Finally, practice past questions using your case studies so that you can write fluent, well-supported answers under timed conditions and show examiners that you can think like a geographer.
