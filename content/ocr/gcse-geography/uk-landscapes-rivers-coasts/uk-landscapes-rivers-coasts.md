# UK landscapes, rivers and coasts (GCSE Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## The big picture: how UK landscapes are arranged and why they matter
The landscapes of the United Kingdom are the product of long-term interactions between geology, climate and human activity. At a national scale you can summarise the pattern simply: upland landscapes dominate in the north and west where older, harder rocks and steeper relief survive; lowland landscapes are more common in the south and east where younger, softer rocks have been more easily worn down. Superimposed on this basic pattern are the scars and deposits of past ice ages: glaciated valleys, cirques and moraines in places such as the Lake District, the Scottish Highlands and parts of northern England. These broad differences determine where agriculture is most productive, where towns and transport routes developed, and how people use and manage land. For exam and fieldwork purposes it is useful to think in terms of scale: national patterns (where uplands and lowlands are), regional contrasts (for example the Pennines compared with East Anglia) and local, site-specific features formed by rivers and the sea.

## Geomorphic processes that shape the land
All of the distinctive forms seen in UK landscapes arise from a relatively small set of geomorphic processes. Weathering breaks rock down in situ; this may be mechanical when freeze–thaw pries rock apart on cold hillsides, chemical when rainfall slowly dissolves limestone, or biological where plant roots and burrowing animals weaken rock. Mass movement moves material downslope by sliding or slumping, often after heavy rain reduces cohesion. Rivers and coasts are agents of erosion, transport and deposition. Erosion by water includes abrasion where load grinds the bed and banks, hydraulic action where water forces air into cracks, attrition where sediment grains hit each other and become smaller, and solution where soluble minerals dissolve and are carried away. Transport operates as traction, saltation, suspension and solution; deposition occurs when energy falls and the river or sea no longer carries its load. The operation of these processes depends on local geology and climate: resistant rocks produce cliffs and waterfalls; softer rocks produce bays and wide beaches; heavy rainfall increases river discharge and the potential for erosion and mass movement.

## Rivers: how landforms change downstream and a UK river basin case study
Rivers change as they move from source to mouth. In the upper course, steep gradients and fast-flowing water give rise to narrow V-shaped valleys, interlocking spurs, waterfalls and gorges. A classic example in the UK is High Force on the River Tees, where a band of resistant Whin Sill basalt overlies softer rocks; differential erosion has produced a high waterfall and a plunge pool, with a gorge downstream formed as the waterfall retreats. In the middle course the gradient is gentler and lateral erosion dominates, creating meanders, wider valleys and floodplains. The lower course is characterised by wide floodplains, levees and extensive depositional features; the Somerset Levels and the lower Severn valley illustrate how low-gradient, frequently flooded ground develops. Meanders can be cut off to form ox-bow lakes, and a river’s load becomes finer and smaller downstream through attrition.

When studying a UK river basin you should be able to describe the basin’s long profile, explain how gradient, discharge and sediment characteristics change downstream, and link landforms to processes and geology. Human activity interacts with natural processes. River engineering—such as channel straightening, culverting, building levees and hard flood defenses—changes river speed and sediment transport and can move flood risk downstream. Sustainable approaches such as river restoration, re-meandering and riparian buffer strips reduce flood peaks and restore habitat. Fieldwork investigations often focus on measuring channel width, depth and velocity at a series of sites downstream; combining those measurements with pebble size and bed material analysis helps you explain variations in energy and transport.

## Coasts: types of coastal landforms and a UK coastal case study
The UK coastline shows a wide range of coastal landforms created where waves, tides and currents meet different rock types. Where geology alternates between resistant and less resistant bands, headlands and bays form. Wave-cut platforms and cliffs develop where waves erode at the cliff base; caves, arches and stacks appear where weaknesses such as joints or bedding planes are exploited by hydraulic action and abrasion, with Durdle Door on the Jurassic Coast providing a well-known example of an arch formed in limestone. Beaches are depositional landforms of sand and shingle, often found in bays sheltered from the full force of the waves. Spits and bars develop where longshore drift transports and deposits sediment along a shore; Spurn Point at the mouth of the Humber is a classic spit that demonstrates how prevailing currents and sediment supply shape coastal features, while Chesil Beach in Dorset is an impressive shingle barrier with characteristic storm ridges.

Coastal landscapes constantly respond to the combined effects of geology, sea-level change, storminess and human intervention. The Holderness coast is a clear demonstration of rapid coastal retreat where soft boulder clays are eroded by high-energy wave action; this retreat has serious consequences for villages, farmland and infrastructure. Coastal management strategies vary from hard engineering such as sea walls and groynes designed to protect particular stretches of coast, to softer, more sustainable strategies like beach nourishment, dune restoration and managed realignment where areas are allowed to flood to create new habitats while reducing pressure elsewhere. Teaching and revision should link formation processes to specific coastal features, demonstrate the role of longshore drift in spit formation, and show how management options are chosen according to costs, effectiveness and environmental impact.

## Linking geology, climate and human activity: why landscapes differ
Understanding why two UK landscapes look different requires you to join up knowledge about the underlying rock type, the past and present climate, and human land use. Hard igneous and metamorphic rocks withstand erosion and support upland landscapes with steep relief and thin soils; sedimentary rocks like chalk and clays weather more easily and tend to form lowlands. The British climate—with its temperate, maritime character influenced by the North Atlantic Drift—means frequent rain in upland areas and milder winters than other places at similar latitudes; this influences vegetation, soil formation and the type of weathering. Human activity amplifies and redirects natural processes. Farming changes vegetation cover and soil compaction, urban areas increase surface run-off and flood risk, and infrastructure can fragment habitats and redirect sediment pathways. Contemporary examples include the use of reservoirs and water transfer schemes to secure water supply, and the growth of renewable energy projects such as wind farms which alter visual landscapes and land use.

## Fieldwork and geographical skills: how to investigate rivers and coasts
Fieldwork is essential for learning geography and is assessed in the Geographical Skills component. Effective fieldwork starts with clear questions such as “How does channel width and velocity change downstream?” or “How does beach profile vary along this stretch of coast?” Good practice includes designing appropriate data collection sheets, selecting suitable sampling strategies, considering accuracy and reliability, and ensuring safe, ethical conduct. At river sites measurement techniques commonly include measuring width and depth with tapes and metre sticks, timing floats to estimate velocity, using flow meters where available, and sampling bed material with pebbles measured by the intermediate axis method. For coasts, transects and beach profiles using a clinometer or ranging poles, sediment sampling and sieve or pebble size analysis, and visual surveys of coastal defenses provide useful data. Back in the classroom students should display data using appropriate graphs and maps, calculate measures of central tendency and spread, sketch trend lines, and interpret results in terms of processes and human impacts. Familiarity with OS map skills—reading contours and calculating gradients—and with basic GIS ideas such as overlaying data layers strengthens both fieldwork and exam answers. Centres must provide learners with at least two fieldwork opportunities in contrasting environments, one physical and one human, and pupils should be prepared to answer questions based on both their own fieldwork and unfamiliar contexts.

## Making connections and choosing case studies
For GCSE Geography you are expected to apply theory to specific, contemporary case studies. Choose clear, recent examples for your river basin and coastal landscape that you can describe in detail and link to processes and management. A river basin case study might be the River Tees to illustrate waterfall and gorge formation and contrasts between upland and lowland processes, or the River Severn and its floodplain management to discuss flood risk and defenses. For a coastal case study consider Holderness for rapid erosion and human responses, or the Jurassic Coast to explore coastal landforms and conservation versus development tensions. When collecting and revising case study material include quantitative details where possible: rates of cliff retreat in metres per year, dates and impacts of major storm events, numbers of properties protected or lost, or figures for sediment supply and beach nourishment volumes. These specifics add credibility to exam answers and help meet the higher assessment objectives.

## Exam technique
Answering exam questions well requires combining accurate knowledge with clear structure and evidence. For short-answer questions focus on precise terminology: name processes (for example hydraulic action, saltation) and landforms (meander, spit, ox-bow lake). For mid-length questions explain processes and link them to features with a clear sequence of cause and effect: describe the process, show how it forms the feature, and give a named UK example. For extended response questions plan a structured answer with an introduction that outlines your argument, a development that uses geographical concepts, processes and case-study evidence, and a conclusion that evaluates or weighs options. Use the PEEL approach—point, explain, evidence, link—to build paragraphs and make sure each point develops your overall argument. When a question asks for evaluation or management, balance the environmental, economic and social considerations and comment on short-term and long-term effectiveness. Include numerical or map-based evidence when appropriate, such as quoting a cliff retreat rate, giving population or flood statistics, or referring to OS map features using coordinates and grid references. Remember there are SPaG marks, so write clearly, use accurate specialist terms and check spelling of key place names and technical words. For synoptic questions draw links between themes: for example, connect river flooding to land use change, or link coastal defenses to impacts on sediment budgets and adjacent stretches of coast. Time management is essential; spend longer on high-tariff questions and leave time to check your extended responses for clarity and evidence. Practise past-style questions using your case studies, practise presenting fieldwork findings clearly using graphs and maps, and aim to show not just what happens in UK rivers and coasts but why it happens and how people respond.
