# Cleopatra: Rome and Egypt, 69–30 BC (GCSE Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview and significance
Cleopatra VII Philopator ruled in a period of intense political upheaval in the Mediterranean. Born in 69 BC and dying in 30 BC, her life intersected with the final years of the Roman Republic as Pompey, Caesar, Antony and Octavian fought for power. Cleopatra matters for GCSE Ancient History because her career illustrates the interaction of monarchy and empire, the role of personal relationships in international politics, and how ancient sources and material evidence can be read and weighed. Egypt under the Ptolemies was one of the Mediterranean’s richest and most strategically vital regions, supplying Rome with vast quantities of grain and wealth. Cleopatra’s attempts to preserve Egyptian independence and power inevitably brought her into the Roman civil wars and to a dramatic end that shaped the rise of the Roman Empire.

## Ptolemaic background and Cleopatra’s rise
The Ptolemaic dynasty ruled Egypt after Alexander the Great’s conquests. They were Macedonian Greeks who adopted Egyptian religious and bureaucratic practices while ruling a largely Egyptian population. Cleopatra was a member of this Hellenistic royal house and, unusually for her dynasty, is often described as fluent in Egyptian, which helped her present herself legitimately to native Egyptians. She came to the throne in 51 BC as co-ruler with her brother Ptolemy XIII. The early years of her reign were marked by dynastic rivalry, court intrigue and a violent power struggle that led to civil war. Cleopatra’s initial exile and her subsequent return, supported by Julius Caesar in 48–47 BC, show how internal Egyptian politics and Roman intervention were intertwined. Cleopatra’s presentation of herself as both a Macedonian queen and as the living embodiment of the Egyptian goddess Isis was an important part of her claim to rule and of the religious and cultural policies she used to secure support within Egypt.

## Cleopatra as ruler: domestic policy, image and economy
Cleopatra’s reign combined traditional Hellenistic monarchy with active engagement in Egyptian religious life. She promoted the cult of Isis and used temple reliefs, dedications and coinage to present a public persona that linked the monarchy to divine favour. Coins and reliefs survive that show Cleopatra and her son Caesarion, emphasizing dynastic continuity and legitimacy. Economically, Cleopatra had to manage Egypt’s agricultural base, especially the Nile’s grain harvests, which were Egypt’s primary export and a key factor in Roman interest. Her reign involved administrative and diplomatic initiatives aimed at maintaining Egypt’s prosperity and autonomy in a world increasingly dominated by Rome. Archaeological evidence such as relief portraits from temples and coins minted in Cyprus provide direct material clues to how Cleopatra wished to be seen by contemporaries, in contrast with Roman literary portrayals that often emphasise exoticism or moral judgement.

## Rome, Caesar and the aftermath of Pharsalus
Cleopatra’s involvement with Rome began in earnest when Julius Caesar arrived in Alexandria in 48 BC. Caesar’s presence followed his victory at Pharsalus against Pompey and the subsequent murder of Pompey in Egypt. According to the Greek and Roman writers who survive, Cleopatra secured Caesar’s support and used it to defeat her brother Ptolemy XIII in the Alexandrian civil war. Caesar supported her restoration and she bore him a son, Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar, commonly called Caesarion. Cleopatra’s visit to Rome in 46–44 BC and her residence in Caesar’s circle made clear Egypt’s political importance. These events had long-term consequences because they associated Cleopatra with the most powerful Roman leader of the time and made her an unavoidable factor in Roman politics after Caesar’s assassination in 44 BC. Roman reactions mixed fascination with hostility; authors such as Suetonius and Plutarch, writing under imperial Rome, shaped later perceptions of Cleopatra’s role and character.

## Antony, the Donations of Alexandria and the road to Actium
After Caesar’s death, the Roman world polarized between various factions, and Cleopatra aligned herself with Mark Antony. Their relationship had personal, political and strategic dimensions. Antony needed Egyptian resources and a reliable ally in the East; Cleopatra sought Roman military backing and protection for her dynasty. Their meeting in Tarsus in 41 BC is the traditional turning point in their alliance, after which Antony spent much of his later career in the East, dividing his power with Octavian in Rome. The Donations of Alexandria in 34 BC were a public demonstration of Antony’s and Cleopatra’s policy: territories and royal titles were granted to Cleopatra and her children, symbolically reshaping the eastern powers and provoking outrage in Rome. Octavian used the donations and Antony’s perceived subservience to Cleopatra as powerful propaganda, portraying Antony as having betrayed Rome for an eastern queen. The naval clash at Actium in 31 BC saw Octavian’s admiral Agrippa outmanoeuvre Antony and Cleopatra. Their defeat and subsequent retreat to Egypt led to the suicides of Antony and Cleopatra in 30 BC, the annexation of Egypt by Octavian and the end of both Ptolemaic rule and the Roman Republic.

## The evidence: literary and archaeological sources and how to use them
Studying Cleopatra demands careful use of both literary and material sources. The main surviving ancient writers on Cleopatra include Plutarch, Cassius Dio, Suetonius and the Roman poets and historians who follow them. These writers are valuable but must be treated with caution: they wrote decades or centuries later, often with Roman political agendas, cultural prejudices and moralising tendencies. Plutarch and Dio, for example, offer detailed narratives and colourful anecdotes but they were writing in a Roman cultural context which could exoticise and vilify a powerful foreign queen. By contrast, archaeological evidence, coins, temple reliefs and inscriptions provide direct contemporary propaganda produced under Cleopatra’s authority. Coins that show Cleopatra and Caesarion together or coins minted by Antony with references to “king of kings” can be read as deliberate political statements. Egyptian temple reliefs that associate Cleopatra with Isis provide evidence of the religious dimension of her rule. A strong answer in this topic will compare literary accounts with material evidence, explaining why each source might say what it does, what interests or biases the source has, and whether different sources corroborate or contradict each other. Remember that the absence of an Egyptian narrative in Greek or Latin sources does not mean Egyptians did not have their own perspectives; it means those perspectives are less directly preserved.

## Interpreting Cleopatra: modern perspectives and classroom approaches
Modern historians debate Cleopatra’s motivations, abilities and legacy. Traditional Roman accounts emphasise her as a seductress who used sexual power to manipulate Roman leaders, but recent scholarship has emphasised her political acumen, linguistic skills and pragmatic attempts to preserve Egypt. Teaching this topic benefits from encouraging students to weigh competing images: the Roman literary stereotype versus the material evidence of royal ideology. Use a source-led approach in class by comparing an extract from Plutarch or Cassius Dio with a coin, a statue or a Dendera relief, asking what each source claims, what it omits and why. Encourage students to ask questions about provenance, date, purpose and audience. Help them to place Cleopatra within larger themes required by the specification, including the nature of monarchy, the role of leaders and the importance of cultural interaction between Rome and Egypt.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Cleopatra for OCR GCSE Ancient History, remember the assessment objectives. For AO1 you must show accurate factual knowledge, such as dates (Cleopatra 69–30 BC), key events (her alliance with Caesar, the Donations of Alexandria, the Battle of Actium) and concrete pieces of evidence (coins, temple reliefs, Plutarch, Cassius Dio). For AO2 you must analyse causes, consequences and significance: explain why Cleopatra allied with particular Romans, how her policies affected Egypt’s economy, and what her actions meant for the end of the Republic. For AO3 you must evaluate sources: discuss author, date, purpose and audience, and use corroboration or contradiction between sources to strengthen your judgement. In Section A-style questions on a longer period you will be given an unseen passage; use details from that passage alongside your own knowledge to explain and support your answer, but do not attempt a full source provenance analysis unless asked. For depth-study source questions, practise extracting inferences from the source, assessing reliability by considering bias and genre, and bringing in other evidence such as coins or archaeological remains. For the essays, plan a clear line of argument with an introduction that addresses the question directly, a series of focused paragraphs each developing a point with evidence and analysis, and a conclusion that reaches a substantiated judgement. Use specialist terms such as “Ptolemaic dynasty”, “client state”, “propaganda”, “Isis cult” to gain SPaG marks, and write carefully to demonstrate clear spelling, punctuation and grammar. Time management is essential: read the paper carefully, allocate time according to marks available, and leave a few minutes to check spelling and the clarity of your final paragraph. Practice answering past-style questions by combining source analysis with wider contextual knowledge and by explicitly linking your points back to the question throughout the essay.
