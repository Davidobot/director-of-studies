# Alexander the Great, 356–323 BC (GCSE Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: why Alexander matters for GCSE Ancient History
Alexander the Great is one of the most dramatic figures in ancient history and a core option for the OCR depth study. His life and career connect political ambition, military innovation, cultural exchange and the end of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. As a GCSE topic, Alexander offers clear factual content to learn — dates, battles and places — but it also asks you to think about causes, consequences and the strengths and limitations of ancient evidence. The depth study asks you to explain how Alexander achieved his conquests, how he ruled the vast territory he created, and how later writers and surviving objects shape our understanding of him. Throughout the topic, keep in mind the wider themes of leadership, logistics and cultural interaction: these help you answer both knowledge questions and source-based evaluation questions.

## Background and Alexander’s early life
Alexander was born in 356 BC at Pella, the Macedonian capital. He was the son of King Philip II, a shrewd military and political reformer who transformed Macedonia into the dominant power in Greece. Alexander’s mother, Olympias, played a strong role in his upbringing and in Macedonian dynastic politics. Tutored by Aristotle, Alexander received a broad education in literature, philosophy and science which shaped his self-image and ambitions. When Philip was assassinated in 336 BC, Alexander, aged twenty, succeeded to the throne. In the first years of his reign he secured his position in Greece and prepared for the campaign against Persia that his father had planned. Understanding Alexander’s background helps explain both his boldness and his ability to command loyalty: he inherited a professional army, an experienced elite of officers, and a political system that allowed decisive action.

## The Macedonian army and Alexander’s leadership
Alexander’s military success rested on the combination of the Macedonian phalanx and the Companion cavalry, supported by light infantry, archers and engineers. The phalanx, armed with long sarissas, provided a solid, threatening block that fixed enemy formations. Alexander used the Companion cavalry as a decisive strike force, often leading it himself to exploit gaps created by the phalanx. Siegecraft and engineering were also crucial: Alexander’s long sieges (Tyre) and river crossings required skilled technicians and logistical planning. Leadership style mattered as much as tactics. Alexander inspired his troops by personal bravery, shared risk in battle and through a culture of rewards and honors. He also relied on close companions and experienced officers such as Parmenion, Hephaestion and later Ptolemy and Seleucus, creating a command structure that balanced talent and loyalty. When studying the army, be ready to explain how equipment, tactics and leadership combined to win battles against numerically larger Persian forces.

## Major campaigns and decisive battles
Alexander’s campaign against the Persian Empire began in 334 BC. The first major engagement was the Battle of the Granicus where Alexander’s crossing into Asia Minor met Persian satrapal forces. The victories gathered momentum at Issus in 333 BC, where Darius III personally commanded a Persian army but was forced into retreat, and at Gaugamela in 331 BC, often seen as the decisive battle that destroyed Persian capacity to resist. The capture of key Persian cities followed: after Gaugamela Alexander entered Babylon and then Persepolis, the ceremonial heart of the Achaemenid Empire. The burning of Persepolis in 330 BC is one of the most controversial episodes: ancient writers give differing motives, from drunken vengeance to deliberate political signalling. Alexander did not stop at Persia; by 326 BC he had pushed into the Indus Valley, fighting the Battle of the Hydaspes against King Porus. The march east reached as far as the Hyphasis (modern Beas) where his troops, exhausted and wary of further campaigning, mutinied and forced a return. Alongside pitched battles, Alexander conducted famously difficult sieges: the seven-month siege of Tyre in 332 BC, and the capture of the rock fortress Aornos are examples of his capacity to adapt and persevere. When you revise, focus on the causes and course of these engagements, the strategic aims behind them, and their consequences for both Alexander and the peoples he conquered.

## Governance, cultural policy and city foundations
Conquest was only part of Alexander’s project; he also tried to govern a huge, culturally diverse empire. Alexander adopted a range of policies: he left Macedonian and Greek garrisons and settlers in key cities, appointed satraps (sometimes local rulers, sometimes Macedonians) and encouraged the foundation of new cities, most famously Alexandria in Egypt. These foundations were military and economic hubs designed to secure supply routes and facilitate Hellenic cultural influence. From around 330 BC Alexander increasingly adopted Persian court customs and dress, held mass marriages at Susa in 324 BC to unite his officers with Persian nobles, and promoted a policy of fusion that aimed to bind Macedonians and Persians into a single ruling class. These steps were controversial among his Macedonian soldiers, who feared loss of their privileges and identity. When revising this section, consider why Alexander pursued integration, how effective it was, and how these policies contributed to tensions within his court.

## Controversies, personality and the circumstances of death
Alexander’s life includes episodes that reveal his temperament and the difficulties of ruling so much so quickly. The murder of Cleitus in 328 BC during a drunken quarrel shows Alexander’s volatile temper and the tensions between his Macedonian companions and his growing adoption of non-Macedonian customs. The execution of perceived rivals, the harsh treatment of rebellions and the increasingly autocratic presentation of kingship also alienated some supporters. Alexander died suddenly in Babylon in 323 BC at age thirty-two. Ancient sources offer many explanations for his death: fever (perhaps malaria), complications from wounds and exhaustion, or poisoning. Modern historians debate these possibilities but agree that the lack of a clear successor and Alexander’s sudden death left a power vacuum. The years of infighting among his generals — the Diadochi — and the partition of his empire are direct consequences of this abrupt end. When studying these controversies, separate what ancient writers tell us from what is plausible based on context and other evidence.

## Sources, archaeology and evaluating reliability
Your depth study requires careful use of set ancient sources and archaeological evidence. The core literary witnesses include later historians such as Plutarch, Arrian and Diodorus, who rely on earlier accounts now lost, including those of Ptolemy and Aristobulus. Each writer has purposes and limitations: Plutarch writes moral biographies emphasising character, Arrian is generally admired for his military focus and use of Ptolemaic material, while Diodorus compiles a universal history and sometimes simplifies. Archaeological evidence complements these texts: the Alexander sarcophagus, coins showing Alexander with the horn of Zeus-Ammon, and the Babylonian astronomical diary that records the date of Gaugamela provide independent checks on events and dates. When you evaluate a source in an exam, identify what it claims, consider who produced it and when, note any obvious bias or gaps, and compare it with other evidence to judge its usefulness. For example, a dramatic anecdote in Plutarch about Alexander’s temper can illustrate personality but cannot by itself explain strategic decisions; paired with Arrian’s military analysis and archaeological data on logistics, it yields a more complete picture.

## Legacy and the Hellenistic world
Alexander’s conquests shattered the political map of the Near East and created a world in which Greek language and culture spread widely. The immediate result was not a stable unified empire but a series of successor kingdoms ruled by his former generals: Ptolemy in Egypt, Seleucus in much of the Near East, and Antigonus and his descendants in Macedonia and Asia Minor. The cultural blending that began under Alexander produced the Hellenistic age, characterised by Greek cities, mixed elites and new forms of art, science and governance. Alexander’s reputation as a model of kingship and conqueror persisted in later centuries, shaped by literary and visual images. In a GCSE essay you should be able to weigh short-term consequences, such as the wars of the Diadochi, against longer-term cultural changes like the widespread use of Greek and the creation of cosmopolitan cities.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on Alexander requires balanced use of AO1 (knowledge), AO2 (analysis) and AO3 (source evaluation). Begin short-answer questions with precise facts: dates, names and locations. For source-use questions, spend time identifying the source’s message, its purpose and its limitations; then link it to your wider knowledge to support or challenge the source. When writing essays, open with a clear thesis that addresses the question, then structure paragraphs so each begins with a point, follows with evidence and explanation, and links back to the argument. Use specific examples — a named battle, a policy like the Susa marriages, or a particular source passage — to support your points. For the depth-study essay, integrate source knowledge: refer to what Plutarch or Arrian says and explain how that evidence helps or hinders your argument. Manage your time so the final essay receives the attention it deserves; plan briefly before you write to avoid an unfocused response. Include specialist terms correctly (phalanx, sarissa, satrap, garrison) to aid your SPaG marks, and ensure your writing is clear and grammatically secure. Always end with a concise conclusion that answers the question directly and reflects the balance of your evidence.
