# Britannia: Conquest to Province, AD 43–c.84 (GCSE Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what this depth study covers
This depth study explores the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 and the process by which Britain became a Roman province by the end of the first century AD. It looks at Roman motives for expansion, the military campaigns and key battles of the initial invasion, the work of successive governors in extending control, episodes of native resistance, and the cultural and economic changes that followed Roman rule. The study asks not only what happened, but how and why it happened, and how we know about it. It therefore balances narrative with investigation of the ancient sources and archaeological evidence, and it emphasises the relationship between military action, diplomacy and cultural interaction as Rome turned conquest into a functioning province.

## Why Rome invaded: background and causes
Roman interest in Britain did not begin with Claudius’ invasion of AD 43. Julius Caesar’s expeditions in 55–54 BC had shown Rome that Britain mattered politically and economically, and later imperial rulers viewed Britain as both a potential threat and a source of prestige, commodities and revenue. By AD 43 the immediate trigger for intervention was partly political: the political instability among tribes in southern Britain, including the Catuvellauni under Cunobelinus and his sons, and the flight of the Atrebates’ king Verica to Rome, gave Claudius a casus belli. For the emperor Claudius, who had seized power in AD 41 and sought ways to bolster his reputation, a successful conquest in Britain offered propagandistic value at home. Military, economic and diplomatic motives combined: Roman commanders expected to secure control of the south-eastern lowlands, establish client kings where convenient, and create a base for further operations if necessary.

## The invasion of AD 43: leaders, battles and propaganda
The invasion was led by the general Aulus Plautius, who commanded Roman forces on the ground while Claudius joined the later stage to receive the triumphal honours. Roman sources describe hard fighting at the river Medway and again at the Thames, where the native Catuvellauni resisted fiercely. The Romans succeeded through a mixture of professional discipline, superior organisation and the ability to exploit divisions among the Britons. The fall of Camulodunum (Colchester), an early centre of tribal power that was turned into a Roman base, was presented in Rome as a decisive moment and was used in Claudius’ propaganda to show that the emperor had restored order and extended Roman civilisation. Contemporary commanders such as Vespasian, who served as a legate under Plautius and later became emperor, played important roles in securing territory and consolidating control in the immediate years after the landing.

## Governors, policy shifts and the slow conquest
After the initial invasion, Roman policy in Britain was not static; it shifted with each governor and in response to local conditions. Early governors focused on pacification, establishing forts and roads and creating client relationships with local rulers. Ostorius Scapula engaged in campaigns in Wales and against resistance in the west; Didius Gallus followed policies of containment in difficult areas such as among the Silures and the Brigantes. The military approach alternated between punitive campaigns, strategic fortification and negotiated settlements. Later governors, especially Agricola (governor from AD 78), pursued an energetic programme of campaigns and infrastructure that extended Roman control into new areas, including much of modern-day Wales and parts of northern Britain. Agricultural exploitation, road-building and the founding of new towns accompanied military expansion, marking the transition from a conquered region to a provincial system.

## Romanisation: towns, economy and client kings
Roman rule brought distinctive social and economic changes that historians call Romanisation, although the degree of change varied across Britain. In the southeast, towns such as Camulodunum were reorganised along Roman lines and became centres of administration and settlement for veterans. The creation of client kingdoms—local rulers who were loyal to Rome and governed on Rome’s behalf—was an important diplomatic strategy. Kings such as Cogidubnus (often linked in the sources to the Atrebates) retained local influence while supporting Roman interests, receiving privileges and sometimes civic honours. Infrastructure projects, including roads such as the Fosse Way, a network of forts, and towns with baths and forums, stimulated trade and the spread of Roman material culture. Archaeological evidence at sites like Fishbourne, where an elaborate palace complex shows high-status adoption of Roman art and architecture, and at Bath (Aquae Sulis), which developed as a religious and leisure centre, illustrates how Roman lifestyles and economic models took hold in parts of Britain.

## Resistance: Boudicca, Caratacus and continuing uprisings
Resistance to Roman rule continued for decades and sometimes erupted dramatically. The most famous revolt was that of Boudicca, queen of the Iceni, in AD 60–61. The causes included the mistreatment of her family and people after the death of her husband, Prasutagus, and wider grievances at Roman actions such as confiscation of land and harsh treatment of local elites. Boudicca’s forces destroyed Camulodunum, Londinium and Verulamium before Roman troops under Governor Suetonius Paulinus defeated the rebels in a pitched battle. Earlier resistance was led by figures such as Caratacus of the Catuvellauni, who continued fighting in western regions before being captured and taken to Rome; his dramatic speech and pardon, as reported by Roman writers, became a celebrated example of the complex relationship between conqueror and conquered. Other uprisings, such as those under Venutius among the Brigantes, show that some regions remained difficult to hold and that Roman domination was often negotiated rather than absolute.

## The evidence: literary sources and archaeology, and how to use them
Our picture of the conquest and its aftermath depends on Roman literary accounts, inscriptions, coins and a wealth of archaeological finds. Major literary sources include Tacitus, who provides detailed but partisan accounts in his Agricola and Annals; Cassius Dio offers a later narrative with occasional unique details; Suetonius contributes episodes about emperors involved in British affairs; and contemporaneous material such as military diplomas, inscriptions and the Vindolanda tablets give direct evidence of army logistics and everyday life. Archaeology supplies the concrete remains of forts, villas, imported pottery, coins and town plans. When using these sources it is important to remember their biases and limitations: Roman writers wrote for Roman audiences and often emphasised imperial success or moral lessons; Tacitus in particular wrote to celebrate his relative Agricola and may have exaggerated aspects of conquest. Archaeological evidence is powerful because it is direct, but it can be difficult to date precisely or to interpret without supporting texts. Effective historical analysis combines both kinds of evidence, using archaeology to test and refine literary claims and interpreting texts in their political and cultural contexts.

## Legacy by AD c.84: province, military system and long-term change
By c.84 Britain had been transformed from a collection of tribal polities into a Roman province with an established military presence, administrative towns and a growing sense of provincial economy. The network of forts and roads allowed Roman armies to respond to rebellion and to project power, while local elites who collaborated with Rome benefited materially and politically. The long-term legacy included changes in settlement patterns, the spread of Roman-style towns and villas, new trade links across the Roman world, and the integration of Britain into imperial structures. Yet Roman rule did not erase local identities or resistance; instead it produced a complex hybrid society in which Roman and native customs interacted. The governorship of Agricola, and the campaigns into what is now Scotland, illustrate both the reach and the limits of Roman power: military success could be dramatic, but lasting control required administrative and economic integration that took generations.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on this depth study requires combining factual knowledge with source analysis and balanced argument. When dealing with Section A questions on the period, make sure you can explain causes, sequence and consequences in clear prose: set out the short-term triggers (for example, Verica’s exile and Claudius’ need for prestige) and connect them to longer-term motives such as economic interest or security. For source-based questions in the depth study, always read the passage carefully and use it as the starting point: summarise what the source says, then bring in your own knowledge to support, challenge or contextualise it. When asked to evaluate a source, comment on its content, purpose, audience and date, and explain what that means for reliability. For example, if using Tacitus’ Agricola, note Tacitus’ personal connection to Agricola and his aim to praise Roman leadership; this does not make his account worthless, but it does mean you should corroborate key claims with archaeological evidence or other texts where possible.

For essay questions plan before you write. Begin with a short introduction that states your argument and how you will support it. Use paragraphs that each make a clear point, give specific evidence (names, dates, places, archaeological examples) and explain how that evidence supports your overall argument. Balance your answer by considering alternative interpretations and ending with a concise conclusion that sums up your judgement. In source essays, explicitly link evidence from the prescribed ancient material to the question, and use contextual knowledge to assess how representative or exceptional the source’s perspective might be.

Manage your time by allocating it according to the marks available and practising past questions under timed conditions. Aim to include second-order historical concepts—cause, consequence, continuity and change, significance and similarity and difference—to show deeper understanding. Finally, remember the SPaG marks: write in clear, accurate sentences, use specialist terms such as “client king,” “colonia,” “Romanisation,” and “fortification,” and check spelling and punctuation where time allows. Regular practice of source analysis, short answers and full essays will build the confidence and disciplinary skills needed to succeed in this depth study.
