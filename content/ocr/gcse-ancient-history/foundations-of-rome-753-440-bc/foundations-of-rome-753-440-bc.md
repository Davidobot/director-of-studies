# Foundations of Rome: Kingship to Republic, 753–440 BC (GCSE Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: scope, themes and why this period matters
The years from the traditional foundation of Rome in 753 BC to the mid-fifth century BC cover Rome’s transformation from a small settlement on the Tiber into a recognisable early state and, by 509 BC, into a republic. This longer period study asks you to think about political change, religious and social development, the impact of warfare and military innovation, and the ways historians separate myth and later storytelling from plausible historical events. It is not simply a sequence of colourful stories: these centuries set patterns of law, institutions and identity that shaped Rome’s later expansion. For revision, keep in mind the broad narrative arc — legendary origins, Etruscan domination, overthrow of kings, early republican struggles — alongside the continuing themes that connect the eras.

## The legendary kings: Romulus to Ancus Marcius, 753–616 BC
The early stories about Rome are part history and part foundation myth. The figure of Aeneas, linking Roman origins to Troy, and the narrative of Romulus and Remus create a powerful origin story that Romans used to explain their place in the wider Mediterranean world. Romulus is credited with founding the city, organising a citizen-warrior population and establishing early political structures such as a senate of elders. The following kings, particularly Numa Pompilius, are described in sources as shaping Rome’s religious and legal customs: Numa’s reforms emphasise ritual, priesthoods and a stabilising religious order that balanced Romulus’ emphasis on violence and organisation. Tullus Hostilius, often portrayed as warlike, strengthens Rome’s military character through conflict with neighbouring Alba Longa. Ancus Marcius is presented as a ruler combining religion, war and urban expansion. When you study these kings, distinguish clearly between the narrative features of the stories — moral lessons, explanations for institutions — and what archaeological or comparative evidence suggests: by the eighth century BC there is clear urban development at Rome, evidence of population growth and increasing social complexity. These archaeological signs are the most reliable indicators that a political community was emerging, even if the precise sequence and personalities in the literary accounts cannot be taken at face value.

## Etruscan kings and influence: 616–509 BC
From about the late seventh century BC Rome encounters the Etruscans as a politically and culturally influential neighbour. The so-called Etruscan kings — including Tarquin Priscus, Servius Tullius and Tarquin the Proud (Tarquinus Superbus) — are associated with major urban and institutional changes. Sources attribute to Tarquin Priscus significant expansion and to Servius Tullius an important reorganisation of the citizen body, often summarised as the Servian reforms: a census-based system that arranged citizens by wealth and military obligation and that reshaped the composition of the army and civic duties. Etruscan influence is visible in material culture, architecture, and religious practice; features such as temple building, drainage works, and urban planning in Rome show parallels with Etruscan cities. However, the literary accounts present these kings in moral terms and with later political agendas: the narrative of Tarquin the Proud’s tyranny and his family’s scandalous behaviour culminates in his expulsion. When you learn this period, balance the literary picture with archaeological evidence and consider the Etruscans’ role in transferring technology, symbols of kingship and urban models that Romans later adapted.

## Origins of the Republic: overthrow of the kings, 509–494 BC
The traditional date of 509 BC marks the end of kingship and the birth of the Roman Republic. According to the literary tradition, a personal crime — the rape of Lucretia by Sextus Tarquinius and her subsequent suicide — catalysed a popular movement led by figures such as Lucius Junius Brutus and Collatinus that expelled Tarquin and abolished the monarchy. New republican institutions emerged: the consulship replaced the king’s executive power, and a senate became the main deliberative body. The early Republic saw a fragile balance between patrician elites and the broader citizenry. Political power initially remained heavily weighted towards patricians, while plebeians — the bulk of ordinary citizens — were often excluded from holding the highest magistracies and from access to written law. Militarily, the early Republic faced immediate threats from neighbouring peoples; Rome’s response to these challenges is framed in the sources as a test of the new constitution, with battles like Silva Arsia and the interventions of figures such as Lars Porsena shaping the sense of Roman resilience. In studying these events, concentrate on how the Romans explained the transition from monarchy to a mixed oligarchic republic and how that explanation served to legitimise new institutions.

## Securing the Republic: 494–440 BC — plebeian struggle, law and reform
The first decades of the Republic are best understood as a contest over access to political power and legal protection. Plebeian discontent over debt, military service and legal insecurity led to collective action, notably the First Secession of the Plebs in 494 BC when plebeians withdrew from the city and forced concessions. This created the office of the tribune of the plebs and represented a crucial step towards institutional recognition of plebeian interests. Subsequent events — the Volero Publilius episode and reforms in 471 BC, the extraordinary episode of the Decemvirate (a commission of ten officials) and the production of the Twelve Tables in the early 450s, and then the Second Secession — show a pattern of conflict and negotiated settlement. The Twelve Tables provided a written, public code that began to limit arbitrary magistral power and offered legal recourse for citizens. The Valerio-Horatian laws and other reforms of the 440s consolidated some plebeian gains and stabilised the republican system for a time. Throughout this era, military obligations remained a central lever for plebeian bargaining: the army was composed of those who fought, and their ability to withhold service gave them bargaining power. For revision, focus on how change was incremental and reactive, and how the interplay of social pressure, military necessity and legal innovation produced the early structure of the Republic.

## Sources, evidence and separating myth from reality
The evidence for Rome’s early centuries is a mixture of later literary narratives, fragments of antiquarian historians, and archaeological material. Major literary sources are often much later and reflect the authors’ own contexts, agendas and moral aims: they were concerned with explaining institutions and teaching civic virtues. Archaeology gives different kinds of evidence — settlement patterns, pottery, tombs, temple remains, drainage works and urban layouts — which can be dated independently and show patterns of growth and contact. When you evaluate evidence, consider provenance (who produced the account, when and why), internal consistency (does the story fit with material finds?), and external comparison (do other contemporary cultures or inscriptions corroborate aspects of the story?). A good approach is to treat literary tales of singular events with caution while using archaeology to test broad claims about urban development, population growth and Etruscan influence. Remember that some institutional features (such as the senate or certain priesthoods) may well have evolved over time and been projected back into legends to give Rome a respectable origin.

## Teaching and contextual clarification: what students should understand
Students should be comfortable with the chronology and with the idea that the narrative tradition and material evidence serve different purposes. The literary accounts explain identity and institutions; archaeology shows how and when a settlement grew into a city. It is important to understand the mechanics of the political changes: the replacement of a single monarch by dual consuls, the continuing importance of the senate as an elite body, and the emergence of tribunes who could protect plebeian interests. Equally, students should be able to explain military and social change: how the organisation and recruitment of soldiers shifted with the Servian reorganisation, and how military service underpinned political bargaining. Use concrete examples in revision answers: name key figures (Romulus, Numa, Servius Tullius, Tarquinus Superbus), describe specific episodes (the Secessions of the Plebs, the Decemvirate and the Twelve Tables), and refer to archaeological signs of early urbanisation such as fortifications, necropolises and temple foundations. When comparing eras, show continuity as well as change — for example, the persistence of elite influence from the kings into the early Republic, alongside the gradual expansion of legal protections for ordinary citizens.

## Exam technique
Approach questions with clarity and evidence. For the period-study questions you will be asked to display discrete factual knowledge, outline features, use an unseen ancient source alongside your knowledge, and write an essay on a wider theme. Start by reading each question carefully and identify whether it targets knowledge (who, what, when), analysis (why, how), source use (what can be learned from the passage) or balanced judgement (significance, change, continuity). When you use the unseen source in Section A, extract specific details and then explain their significance with reference to your wider knowledge; you are not required to produce a full provenance evaluation for unseen passage questions in the period study, but you must use it accurately and in context. For the depth-study source questions, you will need to evaluate reliability: consider the author’s purpose, date, possible bias, and whether archaeological evidence or other sources support or contradict the account. In essays, structure is vital: begin with a clear focus that answers the question, develop paragraphs each centred on a single reason or theme with specific evidence (names, dates, events and where possible source references), and end with a concise conclusion that weighs the arguments. Use historical terms such as “consulship”, “tribune”, “secession”, “decemvirate”, “Twelve Tables”, “tyranny” and “census” where appropriate because the final essay is also assessed for spelling, punctuation, grammar and specialist terminology; accurate use of these terms gains credit. Time management matters: allow time to plan a short backbone for each answer, keep prose continuous rather than listing, and leave at least a few minutes to check clarity and accuracy. Finally, always link facts to the question’s focus — whether that is political change, military impact, social reform or the reliability of the evidence — and remember that balanced, evidence-based judgement earns higher marks.
