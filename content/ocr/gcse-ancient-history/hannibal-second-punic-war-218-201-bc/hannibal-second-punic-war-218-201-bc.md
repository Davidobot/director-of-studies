# Hannibal and the Second Punic War, 218–201 BC (GCSE Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview of the war and its significance
The Second Punic War stands as one of the most dramatic conflicts of the ancient Mediterranean, pitched between the rising power of Rome and the long-established commercial empire of Carthage. Fought across land and sea from 218 to 201 BC, the war featured awe‑inspiring marches, brilliant tactical victories and strategic reversals. Hannibal Barca, the Carthaginian commander famous for his audacious crossing of the Alps, became the central figure of the conflict and a symbol of military genius. For Rome, the war tested political resolve and military flexibility; for Carthage, it revealed the limits of expansion without secure lines of supply and sufficient political unity. By the war’s end Rome emerged dominant in the western Mediterranean and Carthage was forced into a treaty that ended its imperial ambitions for decades. Understanding this conflict means looking at military action and leadership alongside politics, diplomacy, logistics and the ways ancient writers shaped the story we inherit.

## Causes and background: how the war began
To understand why Hannibal marched on Italy we need to go back to the First Punic War and its aftermath. The peace settlement that ended that earlier struggle left Carthage humiliated and indebted; in the following years Carthage expanded into Iberia where a family dynasty, the Barcids, established a new power base. Hamilcar Barca and later his son-in‑law and sons, including Hannibal, built Carthaginian presence in Spain. The expansion produced wealth, manpower and a political culture that increasingly favoured revanche against Rome. The immediate spark was the siege of Saguntum in 219 BC, a Spanish town that had ties to Rome. Rome viewed the siege as an act of aggression; Carthage defended Hannibal’s actions as Iberian affairs. Long-term causes include rivalry for control of trade and influence in the western Mediterranean, the unresolved grievances from the earlier war, and the growth of a Carthaginian war party that saw force as the only answer to Roman power. These political and economic pressures help explain why Carthage would back a risky campaign into Italy rather than fight only on land nearer home.

## Hannibal’s invasion of Italy: tactics, battles and leadership
Hannibal’s campaign across the Alps in 218 BC is the most famous episode of the war. He took an army—including war elephants—over a hostile mountain route into northern Italy, an achievement that combined bold planning with hard discipline. Once in Italy Hannibal scored a succession of victories against Roman armies at Trebia (late 218), Lake Trasimene (217) and the devastating defeat at Cannae (216). At Cannae Hannibal executed a classic double envelopment: he deliberately weakened his centre to draw in the Roman infantry and then used his superior cavalry to strike from the flanks and rear. The result was catastrophic Roman losses and a tactical masterpiece that has been studied ever since.

Hannibal’s leadership combined personal bravery, tactical innovation and skill in using mixed forces. He coordinated heavy infantry, light troops, cavalry and local allies to exploit Roman weaknesses. His ability to inspire non‑Carthaginian troops and to adapt to circumstances kept his army effective for many years in hostile territory. Nevertheless, Hannibal faced constraints. He lacked a decisive naval force, which limited his ability to resupply and reinforce from Carthage. His operations depended on local alliances with Italian communities and on the hope of more direct support from Carthaginian authorities or reinforcements from Spain—hopes that were only partially realised. Despite brilliant victories, Hannibal was never able to capture Rome itself or to create a political settlement that would see many Italian states break permanently from Rome.

## Rome’s changing strategy and the role of leadership
Rome’s initial response to Hannibal was conventional and costly. The Roman commanders early in the war sought pitched battles, and this approach produced disasters such as Cannae. The political and psychological shock of those defeats was profound, but Rome’s institutional resilience became decisive. Instead of seeking immediate annihilation of Hannibal’s army, Rome adopted a strategy of strategic avoidance and attrition. Quintus Fabius Maximus, appointed dictator in 217 BC, pioneered what later historians call the Fabian strategy: avoid large-scale battles with Hannibal, shadow him, harass his foraging parties, cut supply routes and force him to operate in a resource-poor environment. This cautious strategy was unpopular at the time because it refused direct confrontation, yet it preserved Roman manpower and bought time.

Political leadership also mattered. Rome’s ability to raise new armies repeatedly, to replace losses and to mobilise Italy’s resources showed the strength of its political system and social commitment to the war. Meanwhile, new Roman commanders adapted learning from losses. The war in Iberia came to matter enormously: Roman generals achieved important victories that isolated Hannibal from reinforcements. Most notably, Publius Cornelius Scipio—later nicknamed Africanus—took command in Iberia, secured Roman control there and later carried the war to North Africa. Scipio’s bold invasion of Carthaginian territory forced Carthage to recall Hannibal from Italy, setting the scene for the final confrontation.

## The endgame: Metaurus, Zama and why Rome won
Several strategic turning points brought the war to a close. The defeat and death of Hasdrubal Barca at the Battle of the Metaurus in 207 BC deprived Hannibal of reinforcements from Spain. This loss made Hannibal’s position in Italy less sustainable. In North Africa, Scipio’s successes and his ability to secure Numidian cavalry allies proved decisive. The switch of the Numidian cavalry—light, mobile horsemen renowned for their skirmishing—to Roman side under the future king Massinissa shifted the balance in open battles.

The climactic battle at Zama (202 BC) saw Roman and allied forces confront Hannibal far from Italy. Scipio adapted tactics to neutralise the elephants and used his cavalry effectively to secure the flanks and then to rout the Carthaginian cavalry, returning to strike Hannibal’s infantry. Zama ended in a Roman victory and led to a harsh peace. Carthage surrendered elephants, gave up overseas territories, paid a heavy indemnity and accepted limitations on its military capability. The peace terms struck in 201 BC confirmed Rome’s new dominance. Rome emerged militarily and diplomatically stronger, while Carthage remained an economically important but politically constrained city.

Multiple factors explain Rome’s victory. Strategic depth and manpower allowed Rome to absorb defeats and continue fighting. Rome’s political system proved remarkably resilient and capable of raising and sustaining armies. Carthage’s internal politics, including debates between pro‑war and pro‑peace factions, sometimes hampered coherent strategy and the provision of reinforcements. Control of cavalry allies—especially the Numidians—logistical supply and the ability to open new fronts, such as the Roman invasion of Africa, were decisive.

## Sources and how historians reconstruct the war
Reconstructing the Second Punic War depends on a mixture of ancient histories, later biographies and archaeological remains. The most important ancient narrative is the account given by a Greek historian writing in the Hellenistic period who is often valued for his attempt at critical inquiry and for access to contemporary sources. Roman historians who wrote centuries later offered vivid and moralistic accounts that were shaped by Roman politics and values. Biographical writers emphasised character, virtue and vice, focusing on figures like Hannibal, Fabius and Scipio. Archaeological evidence—coins, inscriptions and battlefield finds—adds material detail that can confirm or challenge literary accounts, for example by showing where armies operated or how they portrayed themselves on coins and monuments.

When you use sources in exam answers think about provenance (who wrote the source and when), purpose (why it was written), audience (for whom) and tone (is it praising or criticising?). A Roman source praising Scipio may aim to justify Roman policy and glorify Roman leaders; a Carthaginian perspective is rarely preserved directly and often comes through Greek or Roman filters. Where sources disagree, look for corroboration and for reasons for disagreement: different political aims, time of writing, or intended moral lessons. Using archaeological evidence can strengthen judgements by providing independent data such as inscriptions recording dedications or the presence of military camps. In short, assess reliability, compare accounts, and use background knowledge to place sources in context.

## Key themes and approaches for study
Several recurring themes help structure answers and revision. Military technique and leadership are central: compare Hannibal’s tactical brilliance with Rome’s ability to regenerate armies and change strategy. Political factors are equally important: Carthage’s internal debates over strategy, Rome’s mobilising institutions and the importance of diplomacy and alliance-building across Italy, Iberia and North Africa. Economic and logistical issues matter: supply lines, access to manpower and control of sea lanes all influenced the course of campaigns. Cultural and psychological factors should not be forgotten; the prestige of victory mattered for recruitment and support, while Roman civic institutions created incentives that sustained long wars. Finally, think in terms of cause and consequence: how did the First Punic War create conditions for the second, and how did the second war reshape Mediterranean politics for the next century? Being able to link short-term military events to longer-term political and economic trends is a key skill in this depth study.

## Exam technique
In the exam, read questions carefully and make sure you answer what is asked. For short knowledge questions provide clear, precise facts with dates and names where appropriate. When asked to use an unseen source, extract the relevant information from the passage and combine it with your own knowledge to offer a fuller picture; do not simply paraphrase the source. When asked to evaluate a source, discuss its reliability by considering who wrote it, when, why and how that might affect the content; then test the source against other evidence and your background knowledge to reach a balanced judgement. For second‑order concept questions (cause, consequence, continuity, change, significance) structure your answer by defining the concept in the context of the question, presenting evidence and weighing different factors to reach a reasoned conclusion. For the essay, plan a brief structure before you write: an introduction that sets out an argument and the points you will use, several developed paragraphs that analyse evidence and interpret sources, and a conclusion that brings the argument together and answers the question directly. Use topic sentences, refer to ancient sources where required, and link analysis to the question throughout. Manage your time, leaving enough time to check spelling, punctuation and specialist terms, as these are assessed. Practice writing under timed conditions and practise planning essays that use both own knowledge and the prescribed ancient sources; this will build confidence in making sustained, evidence‑based arguments.
