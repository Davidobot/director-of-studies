# Law‑making and delegated legislation (A-level Law Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: how law is made in England and Wales
Law in England and Wales is made through a blend of primary legislation produced by Parliament and secondary or delegated legislation made by other bodies to fill in the detail. Parliament remains the supreme law‑maker: Acts of Parliament set out principles, powers and boundaries. But modern government is complex and fast‑moving, and Acts cannot specify every technical detail or respond quickly to changing circumstances. That is why Parliament frequently delegates power to ministers, public bodies or local authorities to make more detailed rules. Understanding why delegation occurs, how delegated legislation is made and the controls that limit misuse of delegated power is central to evaluating the legitimacy and functioning of the legal system.

## Parliamentary law‑making: where delegation begins
The primary law‑making route involves the drafting, scrutiny and enactment of Bills in the Houses of Commons and Lords, with the Crown’s formal assent completing the process. In practice, Parliament sets out the framework and delegates authority within a parent Act by including provisions that empower specified actors to make secondary rules. These enabling provisions must be carefully worded: they define the scope of the power, any limits or procedures, and often specify the parliamentary procedure that should apply to the delegated instrument. The choice of how much detail to include in an Act is political and pragmatic. Some matters are plainly appropriate for direct Parliamentary decision because they raise major policy or rights questions, while others—technical standards, commencement dates, fees and detailed administrative rules—are more suitably dealt with by secondary instruments. For examination answers it helps to show an appreciation of the balance Parliament must strike between democratic oversight and administrative practicality.

## Delegated legislation: types and everyday examples
Delegated legislation appears in several forms, but three types are especially significant for A‑level study: statutory instruments, by‑laws and Orders in Council. Statutory instruments (SIs) are the most common. They are used by ministers to make regulations, orders or rules under an enabling Act and they cover a wide range of subjects, from health and safety rules to the commencement of complex statutory schemes. By‑laws are low‑level regulations made by local authorities, public corporations or other bodies under powers granted by Parliament; typical examples include parking controls, public behaviour rules in parks or local licensing conditions. Orders in Council are instruments made by the Privy Council and can be used in a range of situations, including giving legal effect to certain aspects of foreign affairs and making orders under prerogative powers; they have sometimes been used for important constitutional or emergency measures. To make the material concrete for students, consider how many routine regulatory changes—such as adjustments to benefits, the precise scope of a licensing regime, or health protection measures—have been implemented by SIs rather than by fresh Acts of Parliament. The Covid‑19 pandemic provided vivid recent examples, when much of the urgent public‑health regulation took the form of SIs so that time‑sensitive rules could be made quickly.

## Why delegates? Practical reasons and constitutional concerns
There are practical reasons why Parliament delegates law‑making power. Delegation allows technical detail to be handled by specialists and officials with the necessary expertise, it speeds up law‑making in situations where emergency or frequent change is needed, and it reduces the legislative burden on Parliament so that it can focus on principle and major policy choices. Delegation also allows for local variation when matters are best tailored to local circumstances, which is why by‑laws or local regulations are useful.

At the same time, delegation raises constitutional concerns about accountability and democratic legitimacy. When significant policy choices are left to ministers or unelected bodies, the democratic control exercised by MPs and Peers reduces. Delegated instruments are sometimes densely technical and difficult for non‑specialists to scrutinise. Furthermore, emergency delegations or broadly worded enabling clauses—sometimes called "Henry VIII powers" when they allow primary legislation to be altered by secondary instrument—can appear to undermine Parliamentary supremacy. A balanced revision answer will recognise both the administrative necessity of delegation and the risks it presents to democratic oversight.

## Parliamentary and non‑parliamentary controls
Parliament has developed several mechanisms to control delegated legislation, though their effectiveness is often debated. The most visible controls lie in the parent Act itself: Parliament can prescribe the parliamentary procedure that applies, usually either the negative resolution procedure, where an instrument becomes law unless annulled within a specified time (commonly 40 days), or the affirmative resolution procedure, where the instrument must be explicitly approved by one or both Houses. Beyond these, Parliament has committee systems that scrutinise the form and content of instruments. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments examines technical and drafting issues, while the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in the Lords examines the appropriateness of the extent of delegated powers in draft bills. These committees can draw attention to problems and prompt debate, but they do not have the power to veto most instruments.

Non‑parliamentary scrutiny and informal political accountability also play a role. Ministers are accountable to Parliament and may be questioned or criticised in debates, and changes announced through the media attract public scrutiny. Nevertheless, critics argue that negative procedure in particular places a heavy burden on Parliament to spot and act against problematic SIs, which are often published only shortly before they become law. In assessment answers this is a fruitful area for evaluation: demonstrate knowledge of the mechanisms and then weigh how realistic and robust they are in practice.

## Judicial control: ultra vires and reasonableness
The courts provide a complementary control through judicial review. If a delegated instrument exceeds the power granted in the parent Act, or if it is made in breach of required procedures, the courts can declare it ultra vires and therefore void. Courts distinguish procedural ultra vires, where the decision‑maker failed to follow mandatory procedures, and substantive ultra vires, where the content of the instrument goes beyond the scope of the enabling power. In addition, courts may scrutinise delegated legislation for irrationality under the Wednesbury principle of unreasonableness; if a decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have made it, the court can intervene. Judicial review is a powerful remedy, but it is reactive and requires a litigant to bring a claim, which raises issues of access and costs. For exam answers, explain how ultra vires operates in principle and use it to evaluate whether judicial control is an effective check on executive power.

## Statutory interpretation and the Human Rights dimension
Delegated legislation interacts closely with principles of statutory interpretation. When courts interpret enabling provisions, they consider purposive and literal approaches to determine whether a proposed exercise of power is authorised. The Human Rights Act 1998 further influences interpretation: where possible, courts are required to read legislation compatibly with Convention rights, which affects how both primary and secondary instruments are applied. During the period of EU membership, European law and the doctrines developed by the Court of Justice also had an impact, particularly on interpretation and the extension of rights. Since Brexit, retained EU law and the evolving domestic position remain relevant to how instruments are framed and interpreted. Candidates should be ready to discuss how these interpretive tools temper delegated law‑making and to illustrate how human rights considerations can prompt courts to narrow the scope of secondary powers or to declare that a measure is incompatible with Convention rights, thereby prompting political reconsideration.

## Evaluation and ideas for reform
A high‑quality evaluation recognises the competing principles at stake: the need for efficient, expert, and flexible law‑making on the one hand, and the imperatives of democratic legitimacy, transparency and the rule of law on the other. Delegated legislation scores highly on responsiveness and technical competence, but it can fall short on scrutiny and public accountability. Reforms commonly proposed include tighter drafting of enabling provisions to limit scope, greater use of affirmative procedures for instruments affecting fundamental rights or large numbers of people, improved parliamentary timetabling for scrutiny, enhanced public consultation and more systematic publication of explanatory memoranda. Some commentators propose strengthening judicial review remedies or introducing a statutory register and impact assessments for SIs to improve transparency. A balanced revision answer will assess each reform in terms of feasibility and constitutional consequences, showing awareness that any change shifts the balance between speed and control.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on delegated legislation, start by identifying the legal issue precisely: is the question about types of delegated legislation, reasons for delegation, parliamentary controls, judicial review, or evaluation of the system? For AO1, be clear and accurate in describing statutory instruments, by‑laws and Orders in Council and in explaining the enabling role of the parent Act. For AO2, where application is required, apply the legal rules to the facts in the scenario and show how the enabling power and chosen procedure affect the legality and legitimacy of the instrument. For AO3, structure your evaluation: present advantages, then consider disadvantages and counter‑arguments, and finish with a balanced conclusion that weighs competing values. Use examples to illustrate points—concrete SIs, by‑laws or well‑known instances of judicial review make answers more convincing. Be careful to explain technical terms such as ultra vires, negative and affirmative resolution procedures, and Wednesbury unreasonableness in accessible language, and avoid over‑reliance on long case summaries; instead, refer to the principle the case illustrates. Finally, manage your time so that extended response questions get a clear conclusion and so you allocate enough time to apply law to fact in scenario questions, using short, well‑signposted paragraphs for clarity.
