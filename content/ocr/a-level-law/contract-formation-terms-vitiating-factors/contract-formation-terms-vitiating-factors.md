# Contract law: formation, terms and vitiating factors (A-level Law Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Formation of contract: the building blocks
A contract is created when the parties reach agreement on essential terms and intend that the law will enforce that agreement. For A‑level purposes you should be able to identify the elements that make an agreement a legally binding contract: a clear offer, an unqualified acceptance, an intention to create legal relations, and consideration. These elements are not abstract: they are practical rules used to decide real disputes. When you read a problem question, work through each element in turn. Ask whether there was a definitive proposal capable of acceptance, whether acceptance was communicated in the required way, whether the parties intended to be bound (the family/ domestic presumption and the commercial presumption are useful shorthand), and whether consideration supports any promise relied on as creating legal obligations.

## Offer, acceptance, communication and revocation
Understanding how offers are made and accepted is central. An offer is a statement of willingness to be bound on specified terms; an invitation to treat is not an offer and merely invites negotiations. A counter‑offer destroys the original offer and replaces it with a new proposal. Acceptance must mirror the offer and can be communicated expressly or inferred by conduct. Special rules apply to unilateral offers—promises to pay a reward, for example—where performance can constitute acceptance without prior communication. The law also treats different methods of communication differently: the postal rule treats a properly posted letter of acceptance as effective when posted, which can produce binding contracts even when the offeror has not yet received the acceptance; by contrast, instantaneous methods such as telephone or email generally require receipt before acceptance is effective. Offers can be revoked, but revocation must be communicated to the offeree before acceptance, and a unilateral offer may not be revoked once performance has begun. When answering questions, be precise about timing: identify the moment acceptance occurred and whether any revocation was effective before that moment.

## Intention to create legal relations and consideration
Intention to create legal relations distinguishes social promises from legally enforceable ones. In domestic contexts the presumption is that parties do not intend to create legal relations, though this presumption can be rebutted by clear circumstances showing otherwise; in commercial contexts the presumption is that the parties do intend legal consequences. Consideration is the price for which the promise is bought: something of value in the eyes of the law. The courts will not assess the adequacy of consideration, only its sufficiency. Past consideration is generally not good consideration—a promise made after the act cannot usually be enforced—although practical exceptions exist where a party obtains a practical benefit from a promise to pay for an existing obligation. Pre‑existing public or contractual duties raise difficult questions: generally doing what one is already bound to do is not good consideration unless the promise confers an additional benefit. These doctrines frequently appear in scenario questions, so practise applying them to fact patterns where someone promises extra payment for existing obligations.

## Privity and third‑party rights
The historic rule of privity prevented anyone who was not a party to a contract from enforcing its terms. Modern law has softened this through statute and judicial development. The Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act provides a statutory route by which a third party can enforce a contractual term if the contract expressly allows it or if the term purports to confer a benefit on the third party. At common law, other exceptions survive in narrow forms—agency, collateral contracts and trusts can sometimes give enforceable rights to non‑parties—so when a problem scenario features a third party seeking enforcement, consider both the statutory test and the potential common law workarounds.

## Terms of contract: classification, incorporation and the Consumer Rights Act 2015
Terms set out the promises that constitute the contract. Express terms are those stated by the parties; implied terms arise from the courts, from custom, or by statute. Implied terms in consumer contracts have particular importance because the Consumer Rights Act 2015 implies core terms about quality, fitness for purpose and correspondence with description in contracts for the supply of goods and digital content. Terms are classified as conditions, warranties or innominate terms. Conditions are fundamental to the contract and their breach gives the innocent party the right to terminate and claim damages. Warranties are minor terms and only attract damages. Innominate terms are judged by the effect of the breach: if the breach deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract, termination may be justified; otherwise only damages will follow. Incorporation of terms into a contract can be by signature, notice or course of dealings. A signed document will usually bind its signatory to its terms, but where signing is absent, reasonable notice and a consistent course of dealing are central to whether a term becomes part of the contract.

## Exclusion and limitation clauses: control and interpretation
Parties commonly try to limit liability by exclusion or limitation clauses. Whether such clauses are part of the contract depends on incorporation rules discussed above. Even when incorporated, the courts control their effect through interpretation and statutory restraints. Interpretation is often conducted strictly against the party seeking to rely on the clause so that ambiguities are resolved contra proferentem. Statutory controls include the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, which subjects many exclusion clauses in business contracts to a reasonableness test, and the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which applies a fairness test to consumer contracts and can render unfair terms void. In many exam scenarios you will need to consider whether the clause was drawn to the claimant’s attention, whether it was reasonably brought to their notice, and whether it is permitted by statute or caught by a statutory control that makes it unenforceable.

## Vitiating factors: misrepresentation and its effects
A vitiating factor is a defect which, if present, can make a contract voidable or unenforceable. Misrepresentation is a false statement of fact or law made before contract which induces the other party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentations can be fraudulent, negligent or innocent, and the type determines available remedies. Rescission seeks to unwind the contract and restore parties to their pre‑contractual positions, and damages may be awarded either in tort or under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 where statutory remedies apply. The court will also consider bars to rescission, such as affirmation, lapse of time, impossibility of restitution or interference by third‑party rights. In consumer contexts, silence can in some circumstances amount to a misrepresentation, particularly where the trader has acted in a misleading way or failed to reveal necessary information. The Misrepresentation Act imposes specific consequences for misstatement and gives courts discretion to award damages in lieu of rescission in appropriate cases; understand both the practical effect and the policy reasons for these rules, since they are common ground for evaluation in essays.

## Vitiating factors: economic duress and undue influence
Economic duress occurs when one party is forced into a contract by illegitimate economic pressure. For a successful claim the claimant must show that the pressure consisted of a wrongful threat, that the threat left no realistic alternative, and that the illegitimate pressure induced the claimant to agree. The courts have refined the test to distinguish between legitimate commercial bargaining and illegitimate coercion; if a party simply takes a hard commercial negotiating position that is not automatically duress. Undue influence arises where one party abuses a position of trust or confidence to obtain consent. There are two broad categories: actual undue influence, where undue pressure is proved directly, and presumed undue influence, where a relationship is of such a nature that the law presumes influence and the stronger party must show that the transaction was freely entered into. Cases involving banks and guarantees often illustrate these principles: the bank may be put on notice that a relationship of influence exists and in such cases the bank must take reasonable steps to ensure the weaker party understands the transaction. Remedies for duress and undue influence can include rescission and sometimes damages, but practical limits exist where third party rights intervene or restitution cannot be achieved.

## Exam technique
In exam answers aim to demonstrate three linked skills: knowledge, application, and evaluation. Start by defining the legal rule in a sentence or two, then apply that rule to the relevant facts in the scenario—this is where marks are won. Use the correct legal terminology and refer to authoritative illustrations (familiar leading cases or statutory provisions) to show you understand the rule. When applying the law, be precise about timing, communication and the effect of particular factual details; small distinctions often decide issues. For evaluation questions give a balanced appraisal: explain strengths and weaknesses, consider policy reasons, and where appropriate suggest reform or identify practical problems in administration. In essays requiring a conclusion, ensure your conclusion follows from the evaluation and is clearly signposted. Allocate time so that longer questions receive proportionately more effort, and always read the question carefully to answer what is actually asked rather than what you would like to write about. Practise writing focused, tightly structured answers under timed conditions, and review model answers to understand how examiners reward clear rule application and thoughtful critique.
