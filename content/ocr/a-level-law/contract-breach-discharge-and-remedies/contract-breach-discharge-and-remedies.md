# Contract breach, discharge and remedies (A-level Law Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why discharge and remedies matter
When a contract is made both parties accept obligations and expect the law to provide predictable consequences if things go wrong. Discharge and remedies sit at the heart of contract law because they decide when contractual duties end and what the injured party may recover for non‑performance. Understanding discharge explains how and when obligations come to an end: whether by performance, agreement, frustration or breach. Understanding remedies explains how the law seeks to put the innocent party, as far as money and equity allow, into the position they would have been in had the contract been performed. This section sets out the key concepts, the legal tests you must apply in exam scenarios, and helpful examples to make the principles clear.

## Discharge by performance, agreement and impossibility
The ordinary way a contract ends is by performance: each party does what they promised and no more remains to be done. Practical rules develop around performance: payment of money, delivery of goods, or completion of services discharges the relevant obligations. There are, however, complications such as partial performance, tender of performance and divisible contracts. A party who tenders performance but is refused may still be able to treat the contract as performed for some purposes; where contracts are severable performance of distinct parts may discharge only those parts rather than the whole.

Parties can also agree to end the contract. This can be by a mutual rescission, by performance of an agreed variation, or by operation of agreed terms that permit termination on specified events. Where parties agree, their free will controls the result, subject to the usual requirements for valid contractual variations.

Impossibility or frustration is different: it is a legal doctrine that discharges obligations where performance becomes impossible, illegal or radically different from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at formation. The classic example is the destruction of a unique subject matter, as in the case of a music hall burning down before the performance it was hired for. Frustration is narrowly applied; courts look for an unforeseeable supervening event that is not the fault of either party and which makes the contract’s performance fundamentally different. The consequences are that future obligations are discharged and statutory or equitable rules determine what happens to money already paid or incurred losses.

## Breach of contract and the classification of terms
Not every broken promise has the same legal consequences. Contractual terms are commonly classified as conditions, warranties or innominate (intermediate) terms. A breach of a condition entitles the innocent party to terminate the contract and claim damages. A breach of a warranty gives a claim for damages only, without a right to terminate. Innominate terms are assessed by looking at the effect of the breach: if the breach deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract, they may treat the contract as repudiated; if not, damages will be the appropriate remedy.

This classification matters because it determines the remedies available and the claimant’s options. For example, if delivery of a critical piece of equipment is a condition and the supplier fails to deliver, the buyer may rescind and claim losses. If the failure is minor and the term is a warranty, the buyer is limited to a money award. In practice, courts will look at the construction of the contract and the parties’ intentions to decide how to label a term and how to treat a breach.

## Anticipatory breach and the innocent party’s options
An anticipatory breach occurs when one party clearly indicates before performance is due that they will not perform their obligations. This may be by words or conduct. When anticipatory breach is established, the innocent party has two main choices. They may accept the repudiation, terminate the contract immediately and sue for damages for total breach. Alternatively, they may affirm the contract and insist on performance, suing later if the breaching party fails to perform when due. The choice matters because terminating early brings a present claim for damages, while affirming keeps the contract alive and may require the innocent party to mitigate their losses.

An example of anticipatory breach is a supplier informing the buyer that they will not deliver the goods ordered next month. The buyer can treat the contract as ended at that moment and claim for the loss they will suffer as a result, or they can wait until delivery date and then seek remedies if the supplier still refuses.

## Frustration: scope, limits and consequences
Frustration discharges future obligations when an unforeseen event renders performance impossible or radically different. The doctrine is narrow because the courts do not want to allow parties to escape bad bargains merely because performance becomes more difficult or expensive. Examples that may succeed include destruction of a specific subject matter, illegality arising after contract formation, or events that substantially undermine the contract’s core purpose.

There are also important limits: self‑induced frustration, where a party's own acts cause the problem, will not excuse performance, and foreseeable or contemplated risks taken on by the parties are normally allocated by the contract. Financial hardship or increased cost alone will rarely amount to frustration. Where frustration is established, the contract ends and future performance is excused; payments made before frustration are usually recoverable in part and courts will consider expenses incurred and unjust enrichment to achieve a fair result.

## Damages: compensatory principle, causation, remoteness and mitigation
Damages are the principal remedy for breach and are founded on compensation. The central aim is to put the innocent party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed — the expectation interest. That can include the cost of providing substitute performance, loss of profit, and losses flowing naturally from the breach. Courts will allow reliance and restitutionary awards in limited circumstances, but the expectation principle is the default.

Two causation rules limit recovery. Factual causation asks whether the defendant’s breach was a cause in fact of the loss, usually assessed by the ‘but for’ test. Legal causation then considers whether the loss is sufficiently connected to the breach to justify compensation.

Remoteness of loss is governed by an objective foreseeability test: losses are recoverable if they arise naturally from the breach or were within the parties’ contemplation at the time they formed the contract as a probable result of breach. The classic example is the rule that unforeseen special losses are only recoverable if the breaching party knew of the special circumstances when the contract was made. This rule makes telling commercial partners about particular risks important.

Mitigation requires the innocent party to take reasonable steps to reduce loss. Failing to mitigate will reduce the damages awarded. For instance, a buyer who rejects delivered goods should seek replacement supplies where reasonable rather than simply sitting back and suing for all consequential losses.

Liquidated damages clauses are a contractual attempt to fix the quantum payable on breach. Courts will enforce a genuine pre‑estimate of loss. If a clause operates as a penalty — a sum extravagant and unconscionable in comparison with the legitimate pre‑estimate of loss — the courts will not enforce it and will instead award the actual loss. Modern judicial approaches, while recognising the need to prevent penalties, also respect commercial freedom where the clause protects a legitimate interest and is proportionate.

Calculating damages often requires separating direct loss from consequential or speculative loss, discounting what the claimant saved by the breach, and applying rules about remoteness and mitigation to reach a fair award.

## Equitable remedies and consumer protections
Money damages will not always provide an adequate remedy. Equity offers specific performance and injunctions where damages are inadequate and where personal performance or negative obligations are appropriate. Specific performance compels a party to carry out contractual duties, commonly used where subject matter is unique — such as land or unique goods — and where supervision by the court is feasible. Injunctions restrain a party from acting in a way that would breach contract, for instance preventing a former employee from divulging confidential information where a simple damages award would be insufficient.

For consumer contracts, statutory remedies supplement common law awards. Consumer protections give buyers rights such as a short-term right to reject faulty goods, the right to repair or replacement, and remedies for services that are not performed with reasonable care and skill. These statutory rights aim to protect the typical consumer facing imbalance of bargaining power and to provide practical, accessible remedies that reflect modern commercial realities.

## Practical examples and common exam pitfalls
Consider a supplier who fails to deliver bespoke machinery on the contract date. If the equipment is unique and time or identity is essential, the buyer may treat the breach as repudiatory and claim damages for lost profits. If, before the delivery date, the supplier notifies the buyer that it will not perform, the buyer may accept the anticipatory breach and sue immediately. If the delay is caused by unforeseen destruction of the supplier’s factory, frustration may be pleaded, but only if the loss was not self‑induced and made performance fundamentally different.

Students often fall into two recurring errors in exam answers. The first is failing to classify the term broken and so applying the wrong remedy rule; the second is neglecting to apply remoteness, causation and mitigation when calculating damages. Always identify whether the claimant seeks to terminate the contract or claim damages, and explain why that option follows from the classification of the term and the nature of the breach. In damage calculations, work through factual causation, legal causation and foreseeability, and state what steps the claimant ought reasonably to have taken to mitigate loss.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on breach, discharge and remedies, begin by setting out the relevant legal issues clearly: identify the type of contract term involved and whether the facts point to performance, agreement, frustration, anticipatory breach or actual breach. Apply the law to the facts step by step: for example, if you claim a term is a condition, explain what that label means, why the term should be classified as such on the facts, and what remedies arise from a breach of a condition. In scenario questions that ask for damages, structure your answer to show calculation: identify the expectation position, test factual and legal causation, apply the remoteness test to determine which losses are recoverable, and discuss mitigation. For remedy questions, explain why damages may be inadequate and whether specific performance or an injunction is appropriate, considering the court’s discretion and practicalities of supervision. Where the question mentions consumer contracts or statutory rules, remember to include the specific statutory remedies available to consumers. Use short, well‑reasoned paragraphs, support your points with the governing legal principles, and conclude with a clear judgement on what remedy or remedies are likely to succeed.
