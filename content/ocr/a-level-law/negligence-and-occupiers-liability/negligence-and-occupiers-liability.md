# Negligence and occupiers' liability (A-level Law Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: where negligence fits in the law of torts
Negligence is the backbone of civil liability for careless conduct: it explains when one person must compensate another for loss caused by failing to take reasonable care. At A-level you must be able to set out the elements of a negligence claim, apply legal rules to fact patterns and evaluate whether the law is fair and effective. Negligence claims typically follow the model of establishing a duty of care, showing a breach of that duty, proving that the breach caused damage that was not too remote, and then dealing with any defences and remedies. Occupiers’ liability is a related, statutory strand of liability which addresses when those in control of land or buildings owe duties to people on their premises. Both topics require understanding of key cases, statutory provisions and policy questions such as the balance between compensation and personal responsibility.

## The building blocks: duty of care and its development
The classic starting point for duty of care is the neighbour principle from Donoghue v Stevenson, which asked whether a defendant owed a duty to persons so closely and directly affected by their acts that they ought reasonably to have them in contemplation. The modern test most often applied for novel situations is the three-part Caparo test: was the damage reasonably foreseeable, is there sufficient proximity between the parties, and is it fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty? Caparo is used where no established duty exists; where an established category of duty applies, courts proceed by analogy to precedent. Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire clarified that Caparo does not replace ordinary principles of negligence and that well-established duties (for example, duties owed by motorists to pedestrians) remain governed by previous authority rather than a free-standing Caparo analysis. When you are asked to advise, therefore, always look first for an established duty from precedent and use Caparo only where the case is novel.

## Breach of duty and the standard of care
Once a duty exists, breach is measured against the objective standard of the reasonable person: what would a careful person have done in the defendant’s position? Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks gives the familiar definition of negligence as failing to do something which a reasonable person would do, or doing something which a prudent person would not. The standard can be adjusted to take account of the facts: a professional is judged by the standard of a reasonably competent practitioner in that field, as illustrated by Bolam in the medical context. For trainees and learners, the courts apply the objective standard too; Nettleship v Weston shows that an inexperienced driver is compared to the competent driver. Children are judged by the standard of a reasonable child of the same age, as in Mullin v Richards, and the law recognises that some activities involve obvious risks which adults accept as part of ordinary life. Risk factors influence the assessment: the likelihood of harm, the seriousness of potential harm, the cost and practicality of precautions and whether the defendant had special skills.

Application in exam questions must move beyond recitation to careful analysis. Identify which risk factors are present, justify the standard that should be applied and compare the defendant’s conduct to the benchmark. Use authority—where Bolam or professional standards are relevant, explain why the medical or professional context changes the assessment.

## Causation and remoteness of damage
Establishing a breach is not enough: the claimant must prove that the breach caused the loss. Factual causation is tested by the “but for” question: but for the defendant’s breach, would the harm have occurred? Barnett v Chelsea & Kensington Hospital Management Committee is the well-known example where the but-for test failed because the victim would have died regardless. Legal causation limits liability where there is a novus actus interveniens breaking the chain, as in McKew where the claimant’s own dangerous choice broke causation, or Knightley v Johns where an intervening negligent act of a third party interrupted liability.

Remoteness asks whether the type of loss was a foreseeable consequence of the breach. The Wagon Mound principle requires foreseeability of the kind of damage. The thin skull rule, however, makes the defendant liable for full consequences once some injury is foreseeable, even if the claimant suffers an unforeseeably severe result (as in Smith v Leech Brain). In application, you should distinguish between losses that were reasonably foreseeable and those that are too remote, and check if any intervening acts affect liability.

## Defences and remedies in negligence
Two important defences arise in negligence: contributory negligence and volenti non fit injuria. Contributory negligence reduces damages to reflect the claimant’s share of responsibility; the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 allows courts to apportion the blame and reduce compensation accordingly. Volenti is a complete defence where the claimant has freely and knowingly consented to the risk; it succeeds only where full consent can be demonstrated, and courts are careful not to allow defendants to avoid liability merely because a claimant continued with a risky activity. A classic illustration of volenti is Morris v Murray, where a passenger took an obviously dangerous flight with a drunken pilot and the court treated the passenger as consenting.

Remedies are principally compensatory damages aimed at putting the claimant in the position they would have been in but for the tort. Damages can be for pecuniary loss and for pain, suffering and loss of amenity; mitigation obligations and rules on remoteness limit recoverable losses. In some cases, equitable remedies such as injunctions are available to prevent ongoing or threatened harm. When answering evaluation questions, consider whether the award of monetary damages achieves justice, whether it deters unsafe conduct and whether the compensation system is accessible and proportionate.

## Occupiers’ liability: duties to visitors and to trespassers
Occupiers’ liability is governed by statute and focuses on those who have responsibility for premises. The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 imposes a common duty of care to lawful visitors: an occupier must take such care as is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that a visitor will be reasonably safe while using the premises for the purposes for which they are invited or permitted to be there. The concept of who counts as an occupier was clarified in Wheat v Lacon: it can be anyone with sufficient control over the premises. The 1957 Act deals with visitors broadly defined, and the courts have developed rules for special categories. Children attracted to hazards may receive special protection, as in Glasgow Corporation v Taylor where a child ate poisonous berries; the law expects occupiers to guard against dangers likely to attract children. At the same time, the courts allow a degree of personal responsibility: obvious risks may be accepted by visitors, and warnings can reduce or negate liability if they make the risk clear. Where specialised tasks are carried out by independent contractors, an occupier can discharge the duty by taking reasonable steps in engaging competent contractors, illustrated by Roles v Nathan where chimney sweeps, as specialists, faced risks inherent in their work and the occupier’s duty was limited.

The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 addresses liability to persons who are not lawful visitors—commonly described as trespassers. The 1984 Act imposes a duty only in limited circumstances: the occupier must be aware of the danger or have reasonable grounds to believe it exists, know or have reasonable grounds to believe that someone is in the vicinity of the danger, and the risk must be one against which, in all the circumstances, the occupier may reasonably be expected to offer some protection. Tomlinson v Congleton Borough Council illustrates the careful balancing courts perform: where a risk arises from reasonable conduct by the claimant and is obvious, the occupier may not owe a duty to prevent that self-inflicted harm. For both Acts, statutory wording, relevant case law and policy considerations about public access and safety shape outcomes; in exam answers you should identify the correct Act and deploy statutory sections together with leading authorities.

## Evaluation and policy considerations
When you evaluate negligence and occupiers’ liability, bring in policy concerns and practical effects. Consider whether the law achieves deterrence, compensation and fairness. Questions for critical analysis include whether duty rules are sufficiently predictable, whether the Caparo test leaves too much uncertainty in novel cases, and whether statutory protections for visitors and trespassers strike the right balance between encouraging access to land and protecting safety. The so-called “compensation culture” argument is also relevant: courts have to avoid encouraging trivial claims while ensuring that seriously injured claimants receive redress. Your evaluation should show awareness of competing interests—claimant protection versus a fair burden on defendants—and suggest realistic reforms where appropriate.

## Exam technique
Approach problem questions by following a clear, legal method: identify the issues first, state the rule or authority, apply the rule to the facts and conclude (IRAC). For duty questions start by checking whether an established category of duty exists; if so, apply the relevant precedent and only use Caparo for genuinely novel situations. When discussing breach, always explain the standard of care and the relevant risk factors, and use cases to justify why the standard is raised or lowered. In causation sections apply the but-for test and then consider novus actus interveniens and remoteness; use classic cases to show you understand the legal principles. Where defences are available, evaluate their likelihood of success with reference to the facts and statutory defences in occupiers’ liability. For evaluation essays, structure your answer to present balanced argument, weigh different perspectives and reach a supported conclusion.

Timing and marks matter: spend proportionate time on AO1 knowledge, AO2 application and AO3 evaluation according to the question’s command words and marks. Use precise legal terminology, quote or name key statutes and leading cases where they strengthen your point, and make short, reasoned conclusions at the end of scenario answers. Examiners expect clear legal reasoning rooted in authority and careful application to the facts; practise past questions under timed conditions to refine clarity, use of authority and your ability to reach a persuasive conclusion.
