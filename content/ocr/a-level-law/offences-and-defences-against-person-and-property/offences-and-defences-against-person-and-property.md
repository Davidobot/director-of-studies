# Offences and defences against the person and property (A-level Law Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## General principles of criminal liability
Criminal liability rests on two core elements: the actus reus, the physical element, and the mens rea, the mental element. Actus reus may consist of a conduct (an act or omission), a result (for consequence crimes) or a state of affairs. Omissions can create liability where the law recognises a duty to act, for example a duty arising from a statute, a contractual obligation, or where one has created a dangerous situation. Mens rea covers the defendant’s fault: direct intention, oblique (indirect) intention, subjective recklessness and, in some offences, negligence or strict liability which removes the need for fault. For oblique intention, the law treats foresight of a virtually certain result as evidence of intention. Recklessness requires conscious awareness of risk. Causation links actus reus and consequence: factual causation is tested by the “but for” test, and legal causation asks whether the defendant’s conduct was an operating and substantial cause of the harm, or whether a novus actus interveniens broke the chain. The courts apply these concepts through statutory definitions and a long line of authorities; in scenarios you must identify the elements, explain the legal tests and apply them to the facts before considering any relevant defence.

## Fatal offences against the person
The most serious killing offence in English law is murder, defined by the unlawful killing of a human being with the required mens rea of intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. Where intent is proved, the default sentence is life imprisonment. Manslaughter covers less culpable killings and falls into voluntary manslaughter, where a recognised partial defence reduces murder to manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter, which includes unlawful act manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter’s two principal partial defences are loss of control and diminished responsibility. Loss of control requires a qualifying trigger and that a person of the defendant’s characteristics might have acted similarly. Diminished responsibility requires an abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition substantially impairing the defendant’s ability to form a rational judgment or exercise self-control. Involuntary manslaughter by unlawful act requires a dangerous and unlawful act that causes death, while gross negligence manslaughter requires a duty of care breached to such an extent that it merits criminal punishment. When answering exam questions, carefully separate actus reus and mens rea for each offence, show how the facts meet or fail the statutory or common law requirements, and then consider whether partial defences operate to reduce culpability.

## Non-fatal offences against the person
Non-fatal offences cover a ladder of harm from common assault through to grievous bodily harm. Common assault can be committed by causing the victim to apprehend immediate unlawful force (assault) or by the application of force (battery). The law treats actual bodily harm as an injury that is more than trivial and can include recognisable psychiatric harm. The Offences Against the Person Act 1861 creates offences for assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s47) and for malicious wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm (s20 and s18). The mens rea varies: s18 requires specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm or to resist arrest; s20 requires foresight of some harm or “maliciously” inflicting harm, interpreted as intention or recklessness. Definitional issues frequently arise: what constitutes “force”, whether psychiatric injury qualifies as ABH, and how serious a wound must be. In practice you will need to define each offence, apply the relevant mens rea (distinguishing intention from recklessness), and discuss relevant defences such as consent or self-defence. Using example fact patterns helps to illustrate differences in culpability between the levels of harm.

## Offences against property
Property offences are primarily codified in the Theft Act 1968. Theft is a composite offence requiring the appropriation of property belonging to another, done dishonestly, and with the intention to permanently deprive. “Appropriation” can encompass assuming the rights of the owner; “property” is wide and includes intangible rights in some instances; and dishonesty is judged by the contemporary test applied by courts. The intention to permanently deprive includes borrowing in a way that treats the property as one’s own to dispose of. Robbery is theft accompanied by force or the threat of force immediately before or at the time of the theft, used to enable the theft or to retain the property. Burglary is entering a building as a trespasser with intent to commit theft, GBH or criminal damage (s9(1)(a)), or entering and committing or attempting such offences (s9(1)(b)). Key issues in property offences include whether appropriation has occurred, whether the defendant was dishonest, whether the force used elevates theft to robbery, and whether entry was effective and as a trespasser for burglary. In essays evaluate the policy aims of property offences—protecting ownership and social order—and consider how statutory language has been interpreted by the courts to cover modern situations.

## Defences related to mental capacity and intoxication
Defences that negate mental fault or responsibility draw a sharp distinction between internal and external causes. The insanity defence follows the M’Naghten rules: a defendant must show a defect of reason from a disease of the mind such that they did not know the nature and quality of the act, or did not know it was wrong. A successful insanity verdict leads to special disposals. Automatism, by contrast, requires involuntary conduct caused by an external factor; it may lead to full acquittal, but courts scrutinise whether the cause is truly external and whether the defendant’s conduct was involuntary. Intoxication is treated differently depending on whether it is voluntary or involuntary and on whether the crime requires specific intent. Voluntary intoxication cannot normally excuse basic intent crimes but may negate the specific intent required for others. Involuntary intoxication can be a full defence if it prevents the formation of the required mens rea. These doctrines are technical in application and fertile ground for evaluation: questions arise about fairness where self-induced states cause harm, and whether the law balances individual moral culpability and public protection.

## Other defences and preliminary offences
General defences that may excuse or justify otherwise unlawful conduct include self-defence, duress, necessity, and consent. Self-defence permits use of reasonable force to protect oneself, others or property, judged by what the defendant honestly and reasonably believed at the time. Duress by threats provides a defence where the defendant was compelled to act by threats of death or serious injury, though it cannot be used for murder and its scope is limited by reasonableness and immediacy tests. Duress of circumstances overlaps with necessity and applies where the defendant acts to avoid a threat from the environment. Consent can be a defence in activities where injury is an ordinary feature—contact sports, properly conducted medical procedures—but it will not generally be accepted for serious harm outside socially acceptable contexts. Preliminary offences, like attempts, require the defendant to go beyond mere preparation; the actus reus of attempt is conduct that is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the full offence, while the mens rea requires the intent to commit the substantive offence. Impossibility is no bar to conviction: where the defendant believes they are committing an offence, attempts can be criminal even if the completion is impossible. When analysing scenarios, clearly distinguish which defence is available, apply the statutory or common law tests and weigh policy considerations where appropriate.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions, map your response to the assessment objectives: demonstrate precise legal knowledge (AO1), apply the law to the facts (AO2) and include clear analysis and evaluation (AO3). Start by identifying the relevant offences and giving concise legal definitions. Break down each offence into actus reus and mens rea and deal with causation and any statutory elements. Apply the law systematically to the facts: explain how each element is satisfied or not and consider borderline facts—showing application is how marks are won. When a defence is plausible, set out the legal test and apply it, explaining the effect if the defence succeeds. For evaluation questions, move beyond description to weigh competing principles: fairness, deterrence, protection of the innocent, and coherence of the law. Use leading case names and the key statutory sections as signposts in your answer, but avoid long quotations; judges and statutes should be used to support your point, not replace your analysis. Time management is crucial: for a 20-mark scenario allow time to identify issues, apply the law to those issues and write a short reasoned conclusion; for a 20-mark essay allocate time to plan, write a structured argument and reach a clear conclusion. Practise past-style questions, plan answers using an IRAC or PEEL approach, and after writing make a brief check for missing issues. Clear structure, accurate law, focused application and reasoned evaluation will produce the responses examiners look for.
