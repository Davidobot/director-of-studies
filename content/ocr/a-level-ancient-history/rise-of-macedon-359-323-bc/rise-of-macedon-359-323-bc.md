# Rise of Macedon, c.359–323 BC (A-level Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview and significance
The rise of Macedon between c.359 and 323 BC transformed the political map of the Greek world and ended the long period in which city-states such as Athens and Sparta dominated events in mainland Greece. What begins as a regional recovery under Philip II becomes, within little more than a generation, an empire stretching from the Balkans to the Indus under Alexander. For A-level students this period is valuable because it illustrates processes of state formation, military innovation, diplomacy and cultural encounter; it also offers rich source material and contested modern interpretations that are well suited to the assessment objectives of the specification. Understanding the sequence of Philip’s consolidation of Macedon, his imposition of hegemony over the Greeks, and Alexander’s rapid conquest and administrative experiments helps explain the origins of the Hellenistic world that followed Alexander’s death in 323.

## Macedon before and Philip’s consolidation
When Philip II became king of Macedon in 359 BC he inherited a kingdom weakened by internal disorder, external threats from Illyrians and Paeonians, and a fragile royal authority. His achievement was to create a secure, centralised Macedonian state built on fiscal reform, diplomatic marriages and the establishment of a reliable standing army. Philip reorganised the traditional levies into a professional force, improved tax and tribute systems to fund pay and siege equipment, and cultivated a royal court that could attract skilled craftsmen, engineers and mercenary officers. His multiple marriages were not merely personal affairs but instruments of alliance-building across the northern Greek world. These political and economic foundations allowed Philip to project power beyond Macedonia, setting the stage for the massive expansion that followed.

## Military innovation and tactical advantages
Philip’s military reforms are central to explaining Macedonian success. He introduced a heavily armed, drilled infantry phalanx equipped with the long sarissa, a pike which gave Macedonian formations reach and presented enemies with a dense hedge of spear-points. He combined this with a revitalised cavalry arm, including the elite Companion cavalry, trained to exploit breakthroughs and pursue fleeing enemies. Philip also invested in siegecraft and engineering, learning the value of artillery and specialised equipment for taking walled towns. The synergy of a disciplined, shock-capable cavalry and a deep, spear-armed phalanx, supported by capable officers and better logistics, gave Macedon a combined-arms edge over most Greek city-state armies. It is important to recognise that these were not purely technical changes; Philip’s ability to finance, organise and maintain such forces reflected wider administrative and economic reform.

## Philip’s expansion and relations with the Greek states
Philip’s expansion took place through a mixture of diplomacy, opportunistic campaigning and decisive battles. He exploited Greek divisions and weary war-weariness following the Peloponnesian conflicts to extend influence into Thessaly, Thrace and Chalcidice, and to threaten the crucial Hellespontine towns whose control affected trade and Persian interests. The sieges of Perinthus and Byzantium demonstrated both the limitations of Macedonian sea-power and the broader geopolitical stakes, since Persian intervention and Athenian support complicated Philip’s ambitions. The culmination of his Greek policy was the victory at Chaeronea in 338 BC, a crushing defeat of the combined forces of Athens and Thebes that effectively ended significant city-state resistance to Macedonian hegemony. The subsequent settlement, which included the formation of the League of Corinth and Philip’s election as hegemon, formalised Macedonian leadership while presenting, at least nominally, a framework for unified action against Persia. Philip’s assassination in 336 BC curtailed the next phase of his career, but his legacy — military, political and diplomatic — provided the springboard for Alexander.

## Alexander’s campaigns: from reasserting hegemony to world-conquest
Alexander inherited a powerful state and a well-trained army. He rapidly secured his position at home and in Greece, dealing with potential challengers and reinforcing Macedonian authority. Crossing into Asia in 334 BC, Alexander defeated Persian satrapal forces at Granicus, followed by a more strategic victory at Issus in 333 and the decisive defeat of Darius III at Gaugamela in 331. These battles combined aggressive use of cavalry with disciplined phalanx tactics, bold manoeuvre and close personal leadership. Alexander’s sieges — notably Tyre — and his skill at combined operations against fortified places allowed him to neutralise coastal Persian centres, while the occupation and looting of key Persian capitals such as Persepolis symbolised the collapse of the Achaemenid political structure.

Beyond battlefield wins, Alexander founded cities, established garrisons and appointed satraps to administer conquered territories. He pursued Darius’ family and court, pursued Bessus into Central Asia, and led his army into India, reaching the Hyphasis (Beas) where his troops eventually refused to advance further. The long march back through the Gedrosian Desert was costly and demonstrated the limits of logistics and the human toll of imperial campaigning. Alexander’s death in Babylon in 323 left an enormous, largely personal empire without a clear administrative successor. The immediate political consequence was fragmentation and the wars of the Diadochi, but his conquests reshaped trade, culture and political arrangements across the eastern Mediterranean and Near East.

## Aims, character and policy: continuity and contrast between Philip and Alexander
Comparing Philip and Alexander reveals both continuity and important differences in aims and style. Philip’s aims combined consolidation, security and dynastic aggrandisement; he sought to secure Macedonia’s borders, control strategic towns and insert Macedonian influence into Greek political structures, often through pragmatic diplomacy. Alexander, while inheriting many of Philip’s motives, embarked on an outward-looking campaign of unprecedented scale. His aims blended practical goals — wealth, prestige and the subjugation of rival powers — with personal ambition, a hunger for glory and, increasingly, a desire to integrate diverse populations under his rule. Alexander’s policies of fusion — employing Persians in his army, arranging mass marriages at Susa, encouraging adoption of some Persian customs — mark a notable shift from the more exclusively Macedonian orientation of Philip. Yet continuity appears in their shared use of military innovation and patronage as tools of statecraft. Assessments of their characters vary among ancient writers and modern historians: Philip is sometimes portrayed as a shrewd, ruthless builder of power; Alexander as a genius commander and, at times, a volatile autocrat whose actions could be brutally decisive.

## Sources and historiographical issues
The study of Macedon and Alexander depends on a mix of literary, numismatic and archaeological evidence, each with strengths and problems. Key narrative accounts survive in later historians who drew on earlier material: the authors who provide our main stories were writing centuries after events and often relay partisan or rhetorical traditions. Contemporary Greek sources such as the speeches of Demosthenes are invaluable for the Athenian perspective, but they are polemical and hostile to Macedon. Monumental and numismatic evidence — coins, royal portraits, the Alexander Sarcophagus and inscriptions — help corroborate events, display royal ideology and reveal patterns of representation and patronage. Students should always interrogate provenance, audience and purpose. For example, a panegyric coin or an encomium will exaggerate achievements; an Athenian speech will emphasise threats and moral outrage. Modern historians debate many issues central to the specification: the extent to which Philip’s reforms were revolutionary, whether Alexander intended to create a durable multi-ethnic empire or pursued a personal vision of kingship, and how much of Alexander’s behaviour reflects Macedonian practice versus Persian influence. Effective essays weigh ancient testimony against archaeological material, compare contradictory accounts and make historically grounded judgements rather than accepting any single narrative at face value.

## Teaching and revision focus
When preparing this topic, focus on three interlocking strands: political/state development in Macedon, military transformation and campaigns, and interaction between Macedon and the Greek world (including Persian interaction). Use case studies to bring the period to life: Chaeronea and the formation of the League of Corinth illustrate Philip’s impact on Greek politics; the sieges of Halicarnassus, Tyre and Gaza show logistical challenges and the role of engineering; Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela are useful for analysing tactical developments and command decisions. Encourage students to practise close reading of ancient passages (Demosthenes’ Philippics for Athenian reaction; Arrian or Curtius for battle narratives) and to assess the utility of material culture such as coinage and statues for understanding royal self-presentation. Build fluency in connecting events across the period so students can show change and continuity, and ask them to frame questions about motives and consequences that draw on multiple types of evidence.

## Exam technique
Answering questions successfully on this depth study requires careful management of time, sources and argument. For Section B (the depth study) allocate roughly 75 minutes: spend about 15 minutes on the source utility question and 60 minutes on your chosen essay. For the 12-mark source utility question, begin by identifying the source(s) and their nature, then assess origin, purpose and audience, and evaluate reliability and bias. Always relate these evaluations to the specific historical question in the stimulus: how useful is this set of sources for explaining X? Use precise examples from the text(s) and suggest corroboration or contradiction from other ancient or archaeological evidence. For the 36-mark essay, structure your response with a clear introduction that answers the question and sets out the line of argument, followed by analytical paragraphs that use ancient sources to support claims and consider counter-evidence. Integrate historiographical perspectives where relevant: when the question requires interpretation, show awareness of modern debates and weigh them against the ancient evidence before reaching a balanced judgement. Keep paragraphs focused and time-managed: aim for three to five developed points supported by evidence, with short analytical transitions that link to the central thesis. For the Section A interpretation question (20 marks), practise parsing a quoted modern historian’s argument: identify its claims, place it within the broader debate, test it against ancient evidence and other scholarly views, and conclude with a reasoned verdict on its validity. Throughout the paper, demonstrate AO1 by deploying accurate factual knowledge, AO2 by constructing coherent arguments about causes and consequences, AO3 by using ancient sources critically, and AO4 by evaluating modern interpretations. Clarity, precision and consistent linkage between evidence and judgement will win the most marks.
