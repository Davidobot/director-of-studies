# Relations between Greek states, 492–404 BC (A-level Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview and themes of the period study
The period 492–404 BC is best approached as a long and shifting contest of power, alliance and identity across the Greek world and with the great non‑Greek power of the age, Persia. Over these nine decades the relationships between Greek city‑states were transformed by two great stresses: the Persian invasions of the early fifth century and the long intra‑Greek conflict that followed, culminating in the Peloponnesian War and Athens’ eventual defeat. Students should follow a narrative while also tracing continuities and changes in political culture, military practice, and interstate diplomacy. Central themes are the shifting balance between land and sea power, the tension between autonomy and empire, the role of leadership and individual agency, and the ways in which ideology and practical interests—security, prestige, and resources—interacted to produce alliances, defections and hostilities.

## The Persian challenge, 492–479 BC
The period opens with Persian attempts to incorporate the Greek cities into an imperial order. After the expedition of Mardonius in 492 BC, Persian pressure on the Ionian Greeks and on mainland allies continued, producing the dramatic confrontations at Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis and Plataea. These events forced Greek states to make stark choices: some “medised” and cooperated with Persia; others formed a defensive coalition usually labelled the Hellenic League under Spartan hegemony but in practice a fragile and shifting grouping. It is important to see Persian aims as pragmatic rather than monolithic—Darius and then Xerxes pursued retribution and influence, but their campaigns were also shaped by logistical constraints and changing local allegiances. Equally important is to appreciate the variety of Greek responses: not a simple Greek unity, but local rivalries and pragmatic alliances that could be set aside in the face of a common threat.

## Victory over Persia and the birth of inter‑Greek rivalries, 479–446 BC
The defeat of the Persian expedition produced immediate consequences that reshaped interstate relations. Victory enhanced the prestige of the states most active in resistance, especially Sparta and Athens, but the balance of power soon changed. Athens transformed its wartime naval cooperation into the Delian League, an alliance that quickly became an Athenian empire in all but name. Sparta retained pre‑eminence on the land and within the Peloponnesian League, but the two hegemonies had different organisational styles and political cultures. The helot revolt and earthquake in Sparta in 465–464 BC exposed Sparta’s vulnerabilities and limited her ability to project power externally, while Athens used its naval resources to assert control across the Aegean. These divergent trajectories—Athenian maritime expansion and Spartan land‑based conservatism—laid the groundwork for renewed tensions.

## First Peloponnesian War and the fragile peace, 461–431 BC
The years between 461 and 446 BC are often grouped as the First Peloponnesian War. Local disputes involving Megara, Corinth and other states demonstrated how alliance politics could escalate into wider conflict. Corinth’s troubled relationship with Athens over trade and colonies, Megara’s defection, and episodic battles like Tanagra show that the post‑Persian settlement did not stabilise regional relations. The ceasefire and the Peace of 446 BC attempted to define a balance: Athens would keep its empire and Sparta would control the Peloponnese, with certain spheres of influence recognised. Yet this “peace” was more a temporary truce than a durable settlement. It left unresolved questions about the status and autonomy of allied states, and it failed to eliminate competing interests or resentments; these built up in the 430s and contributed to the outbreak of full warfare.

## Causes of the Peloponnesian War, 446–431 BC
Explaining why war broke out in 431 BC requires moving beyond a single cause. Long‑term structural changes—Athenian imperial growth, the alteration of regional balances, and increased competition between allies—created a climate of insecurity. Shorter‑term triggers included disputes over specific cities (Corcyra, Potidaea), economic sanctions (the so‑called Megarian decrees as an aggravated grievance), and diplomatic failures. Leadership choices and perceptions of threat also mattered: Sparta and its allies feared the expansion of Athenian power; Athens interpreted Spartan actions as direct challenges to its empire. Historians disagree about the weight of each factor, but for students it is useful to combine structural analysis with case studies of incidents that made war both desirable and seemingly inevitable to contemporaries.

## The Archidamian War, 431–421 BC
The opening decade of the Peloponnesian War, often called the Archidamian War after the Spartan king Archidamus II, was characterised by contrasted war aims and strategies. Sparta relied on annual land invasions of Attica designed to force the Athenians to fight on land, while Athens used its sea power, fortified grain routes and revenue from the empire to sustain a long conflict. The Athenian population suffered badly from the plague, a factor that dramatically affected morale and leadership. Military episodes such as the Athenian successes at Pylos and the capture of Spartan hoplites on Sphacteria, and Brasidas’ campaigns in the north, showed how the conflict produced both shifts in reputation and opportunities for diplomatic re‑alignment. These events persuaded both sides that a negotiated settlement might be possible, resulting in the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC. That peace, however, was riddled with exceptions and mutual distrust.

## The Sicilian Expedition, the Decelean War and Persian intervention, 421–404 BC
The period after Nicias is best understood as a collapse of the fragile compromises of the 420s. Athenian politics, in particular the influence of Alcibiades and the push for expansion, led to the Sicilian Expedition of 415–413 BC: an overambitious venture that ended in catastrophic defeat and the loss of ships, troops and prestige. Sparta responded more effectively in the later war by changing strategy: occupation of Decelea in Attica and the use of Persian gold to build a Spartan fleet transformed the balance of naval power. Sparta’s alliance with Persia—once unthinkable in the ideological world of the Persian Wars—shows how practical aims could overwhelm previous enmities. The final years of the war featured a concerted Spartan effort, directed by capable commanders such as Lysander, to blockade and break Athenian resistance. By 404 BC Athens capitulated, its walls were dismantled and its empire dismantled; the result was a profound reshaping of the Greek world.

## Sources, interpretation and historiographical issues
Students must handle a range of ancient sources and learn to judge their value. Herodotus provides narrative on the Persian Wars but writes with cultural generalisations and anecdote; Thucydides offers a more analytical and contemporary account of the Peloponnesian War, with a stress on causation, strategy and the interplay of power and human nature; Xenophon writes later and often with a clearer Spartan sympathy; Plutarch and other later authors provide biographical colour but are removed from events and shaped by moralising aims. Archaeological evidence—inscriptions, coinage, temple remains and memorials—can corroborate or complicate literary narratives. For teaching, emphasise how to read sources: establish provenance and bias; compare accounts of the same event; use archaeology to test claims; and remember that modern historians interpret the evidence differently. The specification requires students to engage with three key debates: why the Greeks defeated Persia in 480–479, what caused the Peloponnesian War in 431, and why Athens ultimately failed; these debates invite both source‑based reasoning and evaluation of modern interpretations.

## How to structure knowledge for assessment
Good revision combines chronological narrative with thematic understanding. Students should be comfortable recounting the main events in sequence—Mardonius, Marathon, Salamis and Plataea; the formation and evolution of the Delian League; helot revolts and the First Peloponnesian War; Peace of 446; causes and outbreak of the Peloponnesian War; Pylos, Sphacteria, Brasidas; Peace of Nicias; Sicilian disaster; Decelea; Persian aid to Sparta; and the final surrender in 404—but also able to use these events as evidence in analytical essays about causation, change and continuity. Practice answering source utility questions by treating each source as part of a set: ask what it can tell you about motivations, reliability, and limitations; consider whether a source represents elite opinion, a particular polis, or a later retrospective view. When preparing for the interpretation question, practise placing a modern historian’s claim against the weight of ancient testimony and alternative modern readings.

## Exam technique
Approach each question with a clear plan. For essays devote time to an introduction that defines terms and frames an argument, use the main body to develop analytical points supported by specific ancient evidence and logical reasoning, and finish with a concise conclusion that returns to the question. In source‑utility questions treat the provided passages as a set: assess provenance, purpose and content, then discuss what they can and cannot tell you about the issue, using other evidence to support or challenge their usefulness. For the interpretation question read the quotation carefully, identify the historian’s argument, break it down into parts and test each part against your knowledge of events and primary sources, considering alternative interpretations where appropriate. Time management matters: allocate roughly equal time to Section A (period study) and Section B (depth study) as advised in the specification, and within each section leave time to plan and to review. Always demonstrate awareness of AO1–AO4: show detailed factual knowledge, construct sustained arguments, use and evaluate ancient sources, and engage with modern interpretations. Signpost your judgements so the examiner can follow your reasoning, and make explicit links between evidence and the claim you are making. Practise under timed conditions with past questions, and use feedback to tighten argumentation and source use.
