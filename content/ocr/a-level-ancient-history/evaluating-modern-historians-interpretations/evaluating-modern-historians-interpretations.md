# Evaluating modern historians' interpretations (A-level Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Why interpretation questions matter
Interpreting modern historians is central to A-level Ancient History because it tests not only what you know about the ancient world but how you use that knowledge to judge other people’s arguments. In OCR H407 papers you will meet a quoted passage from a modern historian and be asked to analyse and evaluate it in the context of the period you have studied. This task maps directly on to AO4, but full credit depends on bringing in AO1 knowledge of the period, AO3 analysis of ancient sources, and AO2 evaluation to reach a substantiated judgement. In short, successful answers show you can read an argument, place it in the wider debate, weigh its evidence and explain its strengths and limitations using both ancient evidence and your wider understanding.

## What counts as a historian’s interpretation
A historian’s interpretation is a reasoned explanation about past events, individuals or processes: a claim about causes, significance, character or consequence. Interpretations vary by focus and method. Some are political or institutional, emphasising constitutional change or elite decision-making; others are social or economic, arguing that class, landholding or resources drove events. Intellectual and cultural readings highlight ideas, rhetoric or religion; military or strategic readings prioritise logistics and leadership. Historians may be described as revisionist when they challenge older orthodoxies, or as structuralists when they stress long-term forces. Recognising the kind of interpretation you are reading helps you set criteria for evaluation: for example, a socio-economic explanation should be tested against evidence for material change, whereas a cultural reading should be tested against texts, monuments and ritual practice.

## Unpacking the passage: claims, assumptions and language
Begin by reading the passage carefully and paraphrasing its central claim in your opening lines. Separate out the component claims and any underlying assumptions. Does the historian assert causation, intention, inevitability or contingency? Notice the language used: words such as “mainly”, “inevitably”, “primarily”, “perhaps” or “demonstrably” reveal degrees of confidence. Look for selective emphasis: is the historian focusing on leaders, institutions, ideas, economics or military factors? Also be alert to anachronistic phrases or present-day categories applied to the classical world; identifying anachronism is a valid line of critique if it misrepresents ancient mentalities or evidence. This close reading establishes the criteria you will use to test the claim in the rest of your answer.

## Placing the interpretation in its historiographical context
A strong answer locates the passage within the wider historiography. You do not need to name many authors, but you should show awareness that other reputable positions exist and briefly characterise them. For example, in questions about the Peloponnesian War you might contrast interpretations that blame Athenian imperialism with those that point to Spartan insecurity or to a web of alliance rivalries and economic pressures. In assessing a claim that “Augustus restored the Republic,” set that view against revisionist accounts that see Augustus as creating a new monarchy in republican guise and against older views that emphasise his moral reforms and restoration of order. Placing the passage within this landscape shows examiners you appreciate that historical arguments are contested and that the quoted historian is making one contribution to a debate.

## Testing the evidence and methodology
Evaluation depends on asking what evidence the historian uses and whether it supports the claims. Consider which ancient sources are employed and whether they are representative or selective. Does the historian rely heavily on one genre—mortuary inscriptions, coinage, literary narratives like Thucydides or Tacitus—or combine literary, epigraphic and archaeological data? If the interpretation discounts archaeology, or ignores countervailing testimony from different genres, that is a legitimate criticism. Examine the handling of provenance, chronology and context: are quotations or paraphrases taken out of context? Also assess methodology: is the argument explicit about causal chains and mechanisms, or does it assert conclusions without showing how evidence connects to them? Pay attention to use of comparative evidence and to whether the historian engages with counter-evidence or alternative explanations.

## Assessing plausibility and explanatory power
Beyond source criticism, evaluate whether the interpretation explains the range of known facts and whether it is internally consistent. A persuasive interpretation will account for anomalies, reconcile contradictory sources where possible, and explain why particular events followed from particular causes. For example, an explanation of Athenian failure in the Peloponnesian War that rests only on the Sicilian Expedition should be tested against other factors such as disease, manpower shortages, Persian support for Sparta, and political divisions at Athens. Similarly, a claim that Augustus “restored” republican institutions is weakened if it ignores the long-term transfer of military and financial power to the princeps. Explanatory power also includes judgement about scope: does the interpretation apply to a narrow episode, a whole reign, or a broader structural change? Stronger arguments will carefully delimit their claims rather than over-generalise.

## How to integrate ancient sources and modern debate effectively
Your evaluation must be rooted in the ancient material you have studied. Use ancient authors, inscriptions, numismatic or archaeological evidence to support, complicate or refute the modern interpretation. When you invoke a source, explain its usefulness and limitations: say, for example, that Thucydides is an invaluable witness for Athenian strategy but wrote with his own moral framework and political agenda; that Herodotus provides detail about Persian intentions but sometimes includes folklore; that Tacitus is literary and often hostile to emperors. Where archaeological or inscriptional evidence offers independent corroboration or contradiction, make explicit how it affects the interpretation. Always tie source use back to the historian’s claim: show whether the sources cited by the historian actually support the argument, or whether they have been misread or overgeneralised.

## Constructing a balanced judgement
Finish with a balanced judgement that weighs the historian’s strengths against their weaknesses and states a clear, qualified conclusion. Avoid simple endorsement or dismissal. A good judgement might recognise that the historian brings useful insights—perhaps illuminating neglected social pressures or offering a persuasive reinterpretation of a key text—while also pointing out over-reliance on particular sources, gaps in causal explanation, or failure to engage with alternative accounts. Conclude by situating the interpretation’s value: does it advance understanding, prompt useful reappraisal, or remain plausible only within a limited frame? Your final sentences should make clear the extent to which you accept the historian’s argument, and what evidence would be needed to increase or decrease your confidence in it.

## Exam technique
Approach the interpretation question with a clear plan and controlled timing. Spend the first few minutes paraphrasing the passage and identifying its main claims and assumptions; this forms your introduction and signals to the examiner that you have understood the historian’s argument. Allocate time to analyse the evidence and method, drawing in specific ancient sources and wider factual knowledge to test each claim. Aim to interweave your AO4 comments with AO1/AO3 evidence so that evaluation is always grounded in the ancient material. Be explicit about the usefulness and limitations of sources you mention rather than listing them without comment. Keep paragraphs focused: take one claim of the historian, test it with evidence and methodological critique, and then move on to the next. For the timing on a 20-mark interpretation question, aim for roughly 25–30 minutes: a short introduction, two to three analytical paragraphs, a paragraph situating the passage in the historiography, and a concise balanced conclusion. Avoid spending too long on descriptive narrative unrelated to the historian’s claim. Watch for common pitfalls: paraphrasing the passage without evaluation, offering assertions about sources with no explanation of their reliability, or treating AO4 as if it were only about naming historians rather than engaging critically with argument and evidence. Finally, practise with past interpretation passages from your period, timing yourself and refining the habit of pairing each evaluative claim with precise ancient evidence and clear reasoning; this combination is what gains the higher marks.
