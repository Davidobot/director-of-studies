# Ruling Roman Britain, AD 43–c.128 (A-level Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: the province and the primary questions
Ruling Roman Britain between AD 43 and c.128 is a study of conquest and control, of military strategy and administrative experiment, and of the cultural and economic consequences of imperial rule. The period opens with the Claudian invasion and closes with the consolidation of a recognised northern frontier under Hadrian. Key questions for study are why the Romans invaded, how they established and maintained control over diverse peoples and landscapes, how the army and provincial government worked in practice, and how we judge the impact of Roman rule on British society and economy. Interpretation of these questions depends on a close reading of the ancient literary sources — most notably Tacitus, Dio Cassius and Suetonius — alongside inscriptions, coinage and an increasingly rich archaeological record (town plans, villas, military sites and finds such as the Fishbourne Palace and the Vindolanda tablets). A crucial part of the topic is learning to weigh the strengths and limits of each type of evidence and to build arguments that draw the evidence together.

## Conquest and early expansion, AD 43–60
The Roman conquest began in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius with an invasion force commanded by Aulus Plautius. The motives for invasion — whether dynastic prestige for Claudius, opportunistic exploitation of Roman power, or a longer-term strategic and economic interest — remain debated and should be considered against the available evidence. The initial phase combined direct military action with conciliation: legions secured key river crossings and strongholds, while Rome made use of client kings and alliances. Military campaigns during the mid-first century were marked by the actions of successive governors and generals. Ostorius Scapula and others confronted ongoing resistance, while Caratacus, a leader from the Catuvellauni, led sustained anti-Roman resistance in the west until his capture and presentation to Rome, an event that Roman writers used for propaganda purposes. The Roman strategy mixed conquest with incorporation: military roads, forts and the reorganisation of local elites created the framework for provincial administration and economic exploitation.

## Resistance, revolt and the limits of control
Resistance to Roman rule remained a persistent feature. The great exception to early success was the Boudiccan Revolt of AD 60–61, a large-scale uprising of the Iceni and other tribes that resulted in the destruction of key Roman settlements such as Colchester, Londinium and Verulamium before being suppressed by the governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. Tacitus presents Boudicca with dramatic force and uses the episode to discuss Roman brutality and provincial misgovernment; his account must be read for rhetorical effect as well as factual content. Other episodes reveal a patchwork of accommodation and conflict: Cartimandua of the Brigantes appears as a Roman ally whose handing over of Caratacus to the Romans demonstrates the political work of client rulers; later unrest in northern and western tribes, including resistance associated with figures such as Venutius of the Brigantes and the Caledonian leader whom Tacitus names as Calgacus, shows the unevenness of Roman control. The pattern is important: Rome could win set-piece battles and establish military infrastructure, yet pacification and long-term acceptance of rule were complex processes requiring local collaboration, force and time.

## Governors, the army and client kings: instruments of control
The Roman governor and the legions were the backbone of imperial authority in Britain. The governor combined military command and civil jurisdiction; the procurator and other imperial agents managed finances and taxation. The army provided security, policing and the practical work of colonisation: building forts, roads and public works that both facilitated troop movement and stimulated local economies. Rome also relied on client kings as a cheaper and politically flexible means of control. Named figures such as Prasutagus of the Iceni, Cartimandua of the Brigantes and Cogidubnus of the southeast illustrate different forms of collaboration. Client rulers could act as intermediaries, maintaining local legitimacy while furthering Roman goals, and the elite who adopted Roman styles of life helped to anchor Roman institutions in Briton society. Yet the effectiveness of these arrangements depended on local conditions and personalities; when Rome misjudged or abused client arrangements, resistance or revolt followed.

## Economic, urban and cultural effects of Roman rule
Roman control brought major changes in economy and settlement. The Roman army was an engine of economic activity; forts produced demand for local supplies, stimulated road-building and encouraged market towns. Urbanisation accelerated in the first century, with a range of settlement types — coloniae, municipia, civitates and vici — serving administrative, military and commercial functions. Fishbourne Palace in Sussex offers a striking case of elite Romanised domestic architecture and material culture, suggesting the emergence of a Romanised local elite and the adoption of Mediterranean artistic and domestic models. Agricultural production adjusted to imperial market opportunities, and trade expanded through improved communications and coin-based exchange. The cumulative processes have been called Romanisation: not a single, uniform transformation but a series of social, economic and cultural changes that affected different regions and social groups in different ways. Archaeology is crucial here because it records material culture, settlement layout, and everyday objects that literary sources rarely mention. In evaluating this evidence students must be careful to distinguish between elite, town-based changes and the continuities that persisted in the countryside.

## Frontier policy, consolidation and Hadrian’s Wall, AD 85–c.128
After the aggressive expansion under governors such as Agricola (AD 77–85), imperial policy shifted towards consolidation. Agricola’s campaigns in northern Britain — including the controversial report of a Roman victory at Mons Graupius in Tacitus’ Agricola — suggest a high-water mark of expansion. The later emperors, however, prioritised stability. Domitian’s retrenchment reflected the costs of extended campaigns and competing strategic demands elsewhere in the Empire. In the late first and early second centuries a frontier approach developed that combined fortified roads and a line of forts known today as the Stanegate system; this provided defensible logistics and a military presence without attempting to occupy all upland territories. The decision under Hadrian to build a continuous stone frontier — Hadrian’s Wall, begun around AD 122 — formalised a frontier that was as much administrative and fiscal as martial. Hadrian’s Wall functioned as a controlled border, with forts, milecastles and an integrated system for monitoring movement, taxation and defence. Interpreting these changes requires discussing imperial priorities: the cost-benefit logic of holding territory, the need to control movement and trade, and the ideological value of a defined frontier in an Empire seeking secure and governable boundaries.

## Sources and historiography: reading Tacitus, Dio, inscriptions and archaeology
The evidence base for ruling Roman Britain is eclectic and must be interrogated critically. Tacitus provides some of the most detailed literary narratives — the Annals and Agricola offer governor-centred perspectives that are valuable but also shaped by senatorial concerns and personal agendas. Tacitus’ portrait of Agricola is celebratory and must be balanced with other evidence. Dio Cassius and Suetonius provide additional narrative details and imperial context, but both write with distinct aims and at a distance in time. Inscriptions and coinage deliver direct administrative evidence: dedications, military diplomas and civic inscriptions illuminate formal structures, office-holders and imperial propaganda. The Vindolanda tablets and other documentary finds give exceptional insight into the daily life and logistics of the military. Archaeology supplies the material record of towns, villas, roads and defensive works, enabling us to see patterns of settlement, trade and cultural adoption. A key historiographical task is to compare these strands: how does Tacitus’ account of Boudicca match archaeological evidence for destruction layers at Colchester and London? How do military inscriptions align with the distribution of forts? Students should practise assessing the provenance, purpose and limitations of each source type and use cross-disciplinary corroboration to reach reasoned conclusions.

## Interpreting causes and consequences: contested arguments
Several interpretative debates run through this depth study. Historians disagree about Claudius’ motives for invasion, with interpretations ranging from opportunistic imperialism to political theatre designed to secure the emperor’s prestige. The effectiveness and legacy of Agricola are contested: Tacitus’ account emphasises military genius and moral purpose, but modern discussion questions how far Roman power really penetrated northern communities and whether the victory at Mons Graupius occurred as described. The nature and extent of Romanisation provoke debate: some argue for deep cultural transformation linked to urbanism and elite adoption of Roman norms, while others stress rural continuities and regional variation. Finally, the policy shift to a defined frontier under Hadrian invites questions about imperial strategy: was the wall a pragmatic response to logistical limits, a symbol of control, or both? Engaging with these debates requires students to marshal evidence and weigh modern interpretations against primary sources.

## Exam technique
Approach questions by making a clear argument and sustaining it with evidence from literary, epigraphic and archaeological sources. For Section B source utility questions (typically worth 12 marks) begin by identifying the source’s provenance, date and purpose, and then assess its usefulness for the specific question: consider what the source can tell us, what it cannot, and how its perspective may be distorted. Use other evidence to support or challenge the source: for example, compare Tacitus’ account of Agricola with the distribution of forts and temporary camps, or test Dio’s narrative of Claudius’ invasion against inscriptions and coinage that signal Roman administrative foundations. For extended essays, structure your response with a focused introduction that sets out criteria for judgement, followed by analytical paragraphs that balance evidence and interpretation, and a conclusion that answers the question directly. Make explicit use of historians’ interpretations when the question requires it: present the historian’s argument, evaluate its strengths in light of primary evidence, and integrate your own judgement. Time management is essential: for a two-part exam allocate time for planning and leave a final five minutes to refine your conclusion. Remember that clarity, evidence-based argument and critical engagement with sources and scholarship are the keys to high-scoring answers.
