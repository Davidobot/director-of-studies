# Ancient source analysis (use and utility) (A-level Ancient History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Why source analysis matters for OCR A Level Ancient History
Source analysis is at the heart of OCR’s A Level in Ancient History. The specification expects you to do more than learn facts: you must interrogate the evidence that survives from the ancient world, use it to construct arguments about past events and societies, and evaluate modern historians’ interpretations of those events. Assessment objectives reflect this: knowledge and understanding (AO1) and analysis and evaluation (AO2) are essential, but the largest single weighting is given to the use, analysis and evaluation of ancient sources (AO3). The modern-historians element (AO4) tests your ability to place an interpretation into the wider debate and to judge it against the surviving evidence. Successful source analysis therefore combines factual knowledge with a careful, critical reading of texts, inscriptions, coins and material culture, and an ability to weigh different types of evidence against one another.

## Types of ancient evidence and their different utilities
Ancient evidence comes in many forms and each type offers particular strengths and limitations. Literary texts such as Herodotus, Thucydides, Tacitus, Suetonius, Plutarch and Dio provide narrative frameworks, speeches, moral judgements and detail that are indispensable for telling what happened and why. Inscriptions and official documents — for example tribute lists, decrees and dedications — often give hard data on dates, names, money and administrative actions and can anchor literary claims. Coins, medals and official imagery are powerful for reading propaganda, ideological messages and shifts in political self-presentation. Archaeological remains and monuments, from a temple on the Acropolis to the trace of a fort on Hadrian’s Wall, supply direct physical evidence of building programmes, economic activity and everyday life. When you assess a source’s utility you must distinguish its unique contribution: literary texts often yield context and motive, inscriptions offer administrative certainty, coins show messaging and chronology, while archaeology provides material reality that can confirm, complicate or contradict literary accounts.

## Provenance, purpose and perspective: the first questions to ask
Whenever you meet an ancient source, begin by identifying provenance, purpose and perspective. Provenance covers when, where and in what circumstances the evidence was produced. A speech in Thucydides is reconstructed by a 5th-century Athenian historian writing soon after events; Herodotus writes in the late 5th century about Persian-Greek conflict with a mixture of enquiry and local hearsay; Tacitus and Suetonius write in the early 2nd century and reflect later attitudes to the Julio-Claudians. Purpose asks why the source was created and for whom: public inscriptions or coin legends aim to communicate official messages, dramatic comedies satirise contemporary politics for an Athenian audience, and panegyric or funerary texts promote reputations. Perspective considers the author’s position, interests and limitations: a Spartan constitution written by a non-Spartan observer may exoticise or moralise; a Roman historian who values senatorial authority may emphasise the villainy of emperors who challenge that order. These three questions help you to decide what the source can legitimately tell you about a given historical question.

## Reliability, bias and transmission
Reliability is not an absolute quality but a judgement made in context. Bias can take many forms: partisan political bias, moralising agendas, rhetorical exaggeration, genre conventions and retrospective interpretation. Additionally, many literary works reach us only through later copies, epitomes or authors who abridge, paraphrase or reframe earlier texts. For example, much of our knowledge of the Greek Archaic period comes through later historians and compilations; the Res Gestae of Augustus is a self-authored record designed as a monument to posterity; Tacitus often frames events to make moral points about power. Transmission also matters: the survival of certain sources and the loss of others create a survival bias that affects what we can reconstruct. When you evaluate reliability you should discuss both specific internal signals — such as inconsistencies, anachronisms, emotional language or obvious propaganda — and external markers such as date of composition, proximity to events and corroboration by other kinds of evidence.

## Corroboration, contradiction and silences: using sets of sources
OCR’s depth questions and the Section B source-utility question expect you to treat sources as a set. No single source usually provides a complete answer; rather, the historian’s task is to assemble evidence and judge which pieces are most useful for answering a particular question. Corroboration strengthens confidence in a claim when multiple independent sources point the same way: for example, combined literary and epigraphic evidence can confirm the existence and date of a decree. Contradiction requires careful resolution: differing accounts of the causes of the Peloponnesian War, or of Augustus’ constitutional changes, invite analysis of each source’s agenda and scope. Equally important are silences: what is not said can be as revealing as what is said. A paucity of elite voices from certain regions or groups, or the absence of lower-status perspectives in literary sources, should shape how you qualify conclusions and how you explain limitations in your answer. In a utility question you must judge the set’s overall value, explaining how each element contributes to the historian’s task and where gaps remain.

## The modern interpretation question: reading and responding to a historian
One regular element of OCR paper structure is a question based on an unseen modern-historian quotation. The purpose of this assessment is to test your AO4: your ability to analyse a historian’s argument, place it in the context of scholarly debate and evaluate its validity in light of the ancient evidence you know. When you approach such a passage, first make sure you understand the historian’s claim and its components, then outline the evidence that would support or contradict it. You are not required to comment on the historian’s methodology or their personal context, but doing so can add depth if it is relevant and linked to the argument. Importantly, your evaluation must be evidence-led: draw on specific ancient sources you have studied to show whether the historian’s conclusions are well-founded, overstated, or too narrowly based. Use comparative judgments — for example, “This interpretation is persuasive on the question of propaganda because coinage and inscriptional evidence match the historian’s reading, but it neglects material evidence suggesting a more complex reality” — to structure your response.

## Illustrative examples from OCR topics
Putting these principles into practice is easiest with concrete examples drawn from the period and depth studies listed in the specification. For the Greek period study 492–404 BC, Herodotus is invaluable for Persian campaigns and cultural interactions, but his ethnographic tendencies and reliance on oral accounts mean his testimony needs cross-checking with archaeological finds, inscriptions and contemporary Greek sources. Thucydides is the central source for the Peloponnesian War: his analytical approach and proximity to events make him highly useful, yet his Athenian perspective and occasional rhetorical reconstructions require critical scrutiny. For Spartan society, Xenophon and Plutarch between them provide institutional detail and anecdote, but they represent different genres and later periods; Xenophon’s sympathy for Sparta and Plutarch’s moralising biography must be weighed against evidence about helot revolts, epigraphic records and archaeological indicators of military activity. In the Roman options, Augustus’ Res Gestae functions as public self-presentation rather than impartial biography; Suetonius offers sensational anecdote about emperors while Tacitus is more analytical but often morally charged. Coins, inscriptions and building programmes provide counterbalance, showing public policy and self-image independently of literary spin. In studies of the Late Republic, the rhetorical writings and correspondence of Cicero, along with legal and numismatic evidence, help to reconstruct political culture and the breakdown of constitutions; but partisan bias and later antiquarian transmission remain important caveats. Across all topics, effective source analysis requires matching the right kinds of evidence to the historical question and acknowledging the limits of what the surviving corpus can establish.

## Exam technique
To succeed in source-utility and interpretation questions, manage your time and structure carefully. Spend roughly equal time on Section A and Section B in a 2 hour 30 minute paper, aiming to reserve about 75 minutes for each. Start each answer with a brief, direct opening that defines the question and signals your judgement. In a source-utility question, lead by identifying the specific question the sources would help to answer, then evaluate each source in turn for provenance, purpose, content, value and limitation, before assessing the set’s overall usefulness and reaching a nuanced conclusion. In the interpretation question, begin by summarising the historian’s claim, break the claim into assessable parts, and then support or challenge those parts with precise ancient evidence and wider contextual knowledge. Always link source comments to the historical issue: avoid isolated comments about bias that do not explain the effect on historical inference. Use comparative language to weigh evidence, and qualify your conclusions where gaps or silences make certainty impossible. Remember that the examiner rewards a coherent, evidence-based argument more than a catalogue of sources, so integrate ancient evidence and modern interpretations to produce a sustained and substantiated judgement. Practise under timed conditions, prepare exemplars from each topic, and ensure your answers make clear which sources you are using and why they are relevant to the question asked.
