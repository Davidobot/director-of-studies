# Problem of evil and theodicies (Augustine, Hick) (A-level Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What is the problem of evil?
The problem of evil is the central philosophical and theological challenge of how to reconcile the existence of evil and suffering with belief in an all-powerful, all-knowing and wholly good God. For A‑level purposes it helps to distinguish two forms of the problem. The logical problem asks whether the classical attributes of God are logically compatible with the existence of any evil at all: if God is omnipotent and wholly good, why would any evil exist? The evidential (or empirical) problem is less absolute and asks whether the amount, intensity or kinds of evil we observe — for example natural disasters, famine, or the suffering of innocent children — make the existence of such a God improbable. Students should be able to explain both formulations clearly before engaging with particular theodicies.

## Augustine’s theodicy: privation, the Fall and free will
Augustine offers a theodicy that aims to explain both moral and natural evils without impugning God’s goodness. He begins with a metaphysical account: evil is not a created thing but a privation, a lack or corruption of the good. Just as darkness is the absence of light, evil is the absence of goodness; God created all things good, and evil results when created beings turn away from their proper good. This metaphysical move is coupled with a historical account of the Fall in which the first humans, by misusing free will, introduced disorder into human nature and into the created order. Moral evil is therefore the misuse of the freewill God gave, and natural evil — disease, earthquakes and other forms of suffering — are consequences of the disorder that followed the Fall. Augustine emphasises that God remains the ultimate source of being and goodness; sin is a corruption of creatures, not a positive creation by God. He also stresses the necessity of divine grace: only God’s gracious action can heal the will and restore humans to their intended state. Augustine thus combines a metaphysical claim (evil as privation), a moral claim (free will and culpability), and a soteriological claim (need for grace).

## Strengths and problems in Augustine’s account
Augustine’s theodicy has strengths that make it attractive to many theistic thinkers. By defining evil as privation he avoids the difficult claim that God literally created something morally bad. The free‑will element gives a morally intelligible cause for moral evil: if humans freely choose to harm, moral responsibility is preserved. Augustine’s emphasis on grace fits the pastoral and doctrinal concerns of Christianity: suffering is placed within a broader narrative of fall and redemption. However, there are notable difficulties that students should be able to explain and assess. The privation theory is sometimes criticised as a semantic move that fails to explain the concrete reality of pain and suffering; calling evil a “lack” does not answer why creatures come to lack the good in intensely harmful ways. Augustine’s account of original sin — especially doctrines that link moral corruption to inherited guilt or bodily processes such as concupiscence — raises moral and scientific objections. It seems unfair to hold infants culpable for the sins of ancestors, and modern evolutionary science complicates any straightforward historical reading of a literal first couple whose disobedience explains all natural evils. Furthermore, the claim that natural evils are consequences of human sin seems to struggle with cases of suffering that predate humans or affect non‑moral creatures, and with large‑scale apparently gratuitous suffering such as the Holocaust. Augustine can respond by emphasising God’s inscrutable purposes and the need for grace, but students should explain why this response may not satisfy the evidential challenge.

## Hick’s theodicy: soul‑making, epistemic distance and universal salvation
John Hick revives and develops a broadly Irenaean approach that reframes suffering as part of a divinely intended process of human development. For Hick, the world is a “vale of soul‑making”: it is deliberately constructed with challenges, resistance and the possibility of suffering because these conditions allow moral and spiritual growth. Human beings are created immature and must develop moral and spiritual virtues such as compassion, courage and self‑control. This process requires freedom and real risk; a world in which virtue could be produced automatically would lack genuine moral worth. Hick adds the idea of epistemic distance: God deliberately allows a degree of hiddenness so that belief is not coercive; people must freely respond to moral demands. In his full account Hick argues that God’s ultimate purpose is the transformation of humanity into beings capable of relationship with the divine, and he eventually endorses a form of universal salvation in which all persons will be brought to moral maturity after death. Hick’s theodicy therefore treats evil and suffering as instruments in a benevolent educational process.

## Strengths and problems in Hick’s account
Hick’s theodicy has several appealing features for modern students. It fits intuitions that suffering can lead to positive personal growth, and it explains natural evil without immediately imputing moral blame to God. The notion of epistemic distance responds to the question of why God does not make his existence overwhelmingly evident: too much evidence would undercut genuine freedom. As a response to the evidential problem, soul‑making offers a purpose that can make otherwise gratuitous suffering intelligible. But important criticisms must be considered. One central challenge asks whether the scale and intensity of much suffering really are necessary for soul‑making. Horrendous evils — prolonged torture, mass slaughter, the death of innocent children — seem disproportionately destructive and not obviously redemptive. Critics question whether virtues like compassion could not be developed in worlds with less suffering or whether intermediaries such as training and moral example would suffice. Hick’s eventual universalism also creates doctrinal tensions for many religious traditions: the idea that every soul will be saved can conflict with traditional teachings about judgment and the particular role of religious revelation. Finally, some philosophers argue that soul‑making does not adequately account for animal suffering or natural processes that appear indifferent to human moral development.

## How Augustine and Hick compare and respond to core objections
Comparing the two theodicies highlights important contrasts. Augustine locates the origin of evil in a metaphysical and historical turning away from God and emphasises divine justice and grace; Hick relocates the meaning of evil within a long‑range educational plan that values moral development. Augustine’s response is more rooted in traditional Christian doctrine and soteriology, whereas Hick’s is philosophically imaginative and fits a liberal theistic framework. When faced with the logical problem both theodicies appeal to the limits of human understanding and insist that God’s attributes are not compromised: Augustine by redefining evil as a lack and Hick by proposing a higher teleology. Against the evidential problem Augustine tends to emphasise the inscrutability of God’s purposes and the final restoration by divine grace, while Hick supplies a teleological explanation that treats suffering as instrumental. Students should be prepared to weigh these approaches: Augustine preserves many orthodox theological commitments but struggles with modern historical and scientific critiques; Hick offers an attractive moral psychology but struggles to justify specific instances of extreme suffering and may be less acceptable within conservative doctrinal frameworks.

## Wider responses and pastoral implications
Beyond Augustine and Hick, students should recognise that other strategies exist, from the free‑will defence (which argues that God could permissibly create beings with freedom even at the cost of evil) to process theodicies (which limit divine omnipotence so that God cannot unilaterally prevent all evils), to protest theodicies that foreground the moral demand to resist suffering rather than to justify it. In pastoral contexts theodicies are often less important than responses that acknowledge suffering, identify with victims and mobilise ethical action. For classroom discussion, connecting theoretical claims to concrete examples such as natural disasters, the moral complexity of wartime decisions, and modern debates about evolutionary origins helps ground abstract argument and shows why the problem of evil remains a live and urgent topic for religious thought.

## Exam technique
When answering a 40‑mark essay on the problem of evil and theodicies, aim to demonstrate both clear knowledge (AO1) and sustained evaluation (AO2). Begin with a short introduction that defines the problem of evil and outlines the plan: state you will explain Augustine and Hick and then evaluate them. For each thinker present a precise and balanced exposition: for Augustine include privation theory, the Fall, free will and grace; for Hick include soul‑making, epistemic distance and universal salvation. Use examples to make points concrete: mention natural disasters, child suffering or historical atrocities when evaluating evidential claims. After each exposition offer critical engagement: consider internal tensions, scientific and moral objections, and how each theodicy handles the logical and evidential problems. Then write a comparative paragraph that brings out the different aims and strengths of the two responses, weighing which better meets the challenge posed by particular kinds of evil. Conclude by answering the question directly: judge whether either theodicy succeeds overall, and on what grounds. Throughout, link arguments to the question, write in clear paragraphs, and allocate time so that explanation and evaluation are balanced (a useful guide is roughly 40–50% explanation and 50–60% evaluation for top marks). Use philosophical vocabulary accurately, avoid simply asserting feelings about suffering, and where possible anticipate counter‑arguments to your own criticisms. This structure will make your answer coherent, show synoptic understanding, and meet the assessment objectives for the OCR A‑Level specification.
