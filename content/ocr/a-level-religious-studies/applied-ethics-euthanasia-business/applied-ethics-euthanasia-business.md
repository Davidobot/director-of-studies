# Applied ethics: euthanasia and business ethics (A-level Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: what is applied ethics and why study these topics?
Applied ethics brings ethical theory off the page and into the real world. It asks how moral principles, religious beliefs and philosophical theories can be used to make sense of complicated decisions that affect people’s lives, communities and institutions. Euthanasia and business ethics are two areas chosen for detailed study because they illuminate tensions between individual autonomy and social responsibility, between competing goods such as compassion and justice, and between different ways of understanding what it means to live well. For A‑level Religious Studies you should be able to explain key terms, apply normative theories to concrete situations, and evaluate opposing arguments in a clear, balanced way.

## Ethical frameworks you must use to analyse cases
When tackling applied questions you need a secure grasp of the four normative theories set out in the specification. Natural law, rooted in Aquinas and Aristotelian teleology, locates moral goodness in the fulfilment of an objective telos and supports precepts such as preservation of life. Situation ethics, developed by Joseph Fletcher, prioritises agape — love for the neighbour — as the ruling principle, allowing flexibility according to the concrete situation. Kantian ethics insists on duty and the categorical imperative: act only on maxims you could will as universal law and always treat persons as ends in themselves, not mere means. Utilitarianism, associated with Bentham and Mill, judges acts by their consequences, seeking the greatest overall balance of pleasure over pain or good over harm. All four theories appear repeatedly in questions on euthanasia and business ethics: you will need to explain them accurately and then show how they lead to different conclusions in real cases.

## Euthanasia: definitions, moral issues and practical examples
Euthanasia concerns intentionally ending a life to relieve suffering. Key distinctions matter: voluntary euthanasia is carried out at the competent person’s request, non‑voluntary applies when the person cannot consent (for example, in a persistent vegetative state), and involuntary euthanasia is carried out against someone’s wishes and is usually treated as murder. Assisted dying is differentiated from direct euthanasia because the patient performs the final act themselves, while in direct euthanasia another person initiates the life‑ending action.

Ethical debate turns on several central issues. The sanctity of life principle, often found in religious ethics, claims that human life has intrinsic value and is not for humans to terminate. By contrast, quality of life arguments focus on whether life, reduced to severe pain, loss of personhood or terminal decline, retains moral value. Autonomy is another key concern: how much weight should we give to a competent person’s right to decide what happens to their body and life? Finally, there is a distinction between actively ending life and allowing death by withholding or withdrawing treatment; some ethical systems treat those acts differently, others see both as morally similar.

In contemporary Britain a number of high‑profile legal cases have shaped public debate. Dianne Pretty, who sought legal permission for her husband to assist her suicide, and Tony Nicklinson, who fought to end his life after becoming locked‑in following a stroke, brought the terms of the law into sharp public view. The courts have been cautious; the Suicide Act 1961 criminalises aiding or abetting suicide in England and Wales, and the law has been supplemented by prosecutorial guidance that explains when a public interest prosecution is likely. Parliamentary debates, and several successive Assisted Dying Bills, have kept the issue politically live. When you use these cases in essays, focus on the ethical issues they illustrate rather than only on legal minutiae.

## Applying ethical theories and religious responses to euthanasia
Different normative approaches yield contrasting verdicts on euthanasia. Natural law typically opposes active euthanasia because it regards preservation of life as a primary precept; even withdrawing treatment is fraught, although the doctrine of double effect can sometimes justify withdrawing life‑prolonging measures if the intention is to relieve pain rather than to kill. Situation ethics can be sympathetic to euthanasia when agape — acting out of love — supports ending unremitting suffering; Fletcher would press you to assess the particular context and consequences for human flourishing. Kantian ethics tends to resist euthanasia because treating life as disposable conflicts with the imperative to respect persons as ends in themselves, yet there are Kantian arguments emphasising dignity and autonomy that complicate this picture. Utilitarianism is often the most straightforward route to supporting assisted dying where overall suffering is reduced; however utilitarians must weigh risks such as potential abuses, pressures on vulnerable people, and the wider social impact of normalising euthanasia.

Religious perspectives vary. Traditional Christian positions emphasise sanctity of life and caution against active ending of life, while some contemporary theologians nuance those positions by emphasising compassion and the alleviation of suffering. Secular ethical positions such as those held by Peter Singer evaluate euthanasia through the lens of quality of life and the suffering of sentient beings. When writing essays, demonstrate awareness of both principled religious objections and the pragmatic concerns raised by opponents and proponents alike. A strong answer will balance theoretical clarity with sensitivity to human stories and legal frameworks.

## Business ethics: key concepts and contemporary dilemmas
Business ethics examines moral questions arising in commercial activity, from how companies treat employees to responsibilities towards the environment and wider society. Central concepts include corporate social responsibility (CSR), the idea that firms owe duties to stakeholders beyond shareholders, and whistle‑blowing, where an employee exposes wrongdoing despite personal risk. The slogan “good ethics is good business” captures an argument that ethical conduct supports long‑term profitability through trust and reputation; Milton Friedman’s influential counter‑claim argues that the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits within the law, a view that underpins the shareholder primacy model.

Real cases illustrate the moral tensions. The collapse of Enron, exposed by internal whistleblowers, revealed how deception for profit can devastate employees, investors and the public. The Rana Plaza factory collapse in 2013 highlighted the human cost of global supply chains and the moral responsibility of multinational companies to ensure safe working conditions. Environmental scandals and tax avoidance controversies, such as public anger at companies minimising tax bills through legal but aggressive schemes, raise questions about fairness, justice and the social contract between business and society. These concrete examples are valuable in essays because they allow you to apply theory to lived scenarios.

## Applying ethical theories to business decisions and corporate responsibility
Applying normative theories to business ethics produces a variety of prescriptions. A Kantian approach insists on treating employees, customers and suppliers as ends; practices like deceptive advertising or exploiting labour would be ruled out because they use people as means to profit. Utilitarianism asks managers to consider consequences across all stakeholders: if a factory closure increases overall happiness by reducing costs and preserving a company, a utilitarian might accept it, but the calculation must include suffering of displaced workers and local communities. Natural law and religious ethics introduce concepts of human flourishing and stewardship: employers should promote conditions in which people prosper, and environmental depletion is morally problematic. Situation ethics would demand compassionate responses to individual cases, perhaps endorsing generous redundancy packages or reconstruction efforts where love best serves those affected.

The debate between shareholder and stakeholder models is central. Friedman’s argument that corporations should focus on profit maximisation remains influential, but it is increasingly challenged by evidence that long‑term success often depends on ethical treatment of stakeholders. Whistle‑blowers such as Sherron Watkins at Enron show that ethical courage can expose harm; yet whistle‑blowers often face retaliation, so business ethicists explore institutional protections and the moral duties of employers to cultivate a culture of accountability. When writing, compare theorists and show how a given approach would recommend different corporate policies, paying attention to consequences, intentions and principles.

## Weighing up: common strengths and weaknesses in arguments
Both euthanasia and business ethics require you to navigate competing goods. In euthanasia debates you must weigh autonomy and relief of suffering against the intrinsic value of life and the risk of jeopardising vulnerable people. In business ethics you must balance profit and efficiency with justice, dignity and environmental stewardship. Strong evaluation recognises internal tensions within each theory: utilitarianism’s dependence on often uncertain consequence calculations, Kantian ethics’ abstractness and difficulty responding to tragic dilemmas, natural law’s dependence on contested teleology, and situation ethics’ vulnerability to charges of subjectivity. Good answers draw on a range of sources — philosophers, religious thinkers, and real‑world cases — and show how different approaches illuminate different dimensions of the same problem.

## Exam technique
In examinations, begin by defining key terms succinctly to show AO1 knowledge: for euthanasia, define voluntary, non‑voluntary and assisted dying; for business ethics, explain CSR, whistle‑blowing and stakeholder theory. Use short introductory paragraphs to set out the ethical perspective you will explore. When applying theory, be precise: show how Aquinas’ primary precepts, Fletcher’s propositions, Kant’s categorical imperative or utilitarian hedonic calculations lead to specific conclusions about a case. Always support AO2 evaluation with reasons: identify strengths and weaknesses in the argument, consider counter‑arguments, and bring in religious or secular perspectives as appropriate. Case studies should be used to illustrate rather than replace philosophical reasoning; a few well‑chosen examples (for euthanasia, a landmark legal case; for business ethics, a corporate scandal) will strengthen analysis. Structure essays clearly with paragraphs that each make one point and link back to the question, and end with a concise conclusion that weighs arguments and states a justified judgement. Time management is crucial: for a two‑hour paper with three essays, plan each answer, leave time to develop evaluation, and avoid over‑reliance on descriptive material. Examiners reward clarity, accurate use of terminology, balanced evaluation and relevant evidence, so practise applying theory to cases under timed conditions and ensure your response consistently engages both AO1 and AO2.
