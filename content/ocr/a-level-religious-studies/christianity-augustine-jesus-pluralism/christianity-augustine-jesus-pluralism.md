# Christianity: Augustine, Jesus, moral action and pluralism (A-level Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: how these topics fit together
This unit brings together some of the most influential strands of Christian thought: Augustine’s account of human nature and sin, the identity and teaching of Jesus, practical models of Christian moral action, and Christian responses to religious diversity in a plural world. Each area connects belief with practice. Augustine’s anthropology helps to explain why humans fail morally and why they need God’s grace; beliefs about Jesus shape who Christians look to as authoritative and salvific; moral action asks how Christians should live in public and private, sometimes at great cost; and pluralism forces Christians to think theologically and pastorally about people of other faiths. For revision, focus on the core claims, the arguments used to support them, the variety of Christian responses, and the strengths and weaknesses critics have raised.

## Augustine on human nature, sin and grace
Augustine provides one of the classical Christian accounts of why the world is morally and socially disordered. Reading Augustine means starting with the creation account and the Fall. For Augustine, Adam and Eve enjoyed a state of original righteousness and harmony, but their disobedience introduced sin (original sin) into human nature. Augustine argues that this condition is transmitted to their descendants through human procreation, producing a corrupted will and an inclination toward self-centred desire. The result is a reduced moral freedom: people are able to choose, but their will is weakened and biased by concupiscence (disordered desire). Augustine’s emphasis on the priority of God’s grace follows naturally. Human beings cannot return to the summum bonum—the highest good—by their efforts alone; divine grace is necessary to heal the will and enable love of God.

When teaching Augustine, highlight the distinctions he draws from his predecessors and opponents. Against Pelagius he insists on the depth of human dependency on grace; against a naïve optimism about moral improvement he stresses the stubbornness of certain vices. At the same time, students should be able to explain objections: modern critics argue that Augustine’s anthropology is pessimistic and that the idea of inherited guilt is morally problematic. Philosophical and pastoral questions follow: if the will is so damaged, how is moral responsibility to be understood? Augustine answers by maintaining that people remain morally accountable even as they need God’s transformative action; nevertheless his framework places heavy emphasis on divine initiative in salvation.

## Jesus: revelation, teacher and liberator
Understanding Jesus is central to Christian theology because, for most Christians, Jesus is the fullest revelation of God. Christians approach knowledge of God in both natural and revealed modes. Natural theology looks for divine traces in the order of creation and in human reason; revealed theology locates the decisive disclosure in the person, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus. To study the person of Jesus, balance three complementary portraits that appear in the Gospels and in Christian reflection: Jesus as the Son of God, Jesus as a teacher of wisdom, and Jesus as a liberator.

As the Son of God, Jesus is portrayed as knowing the Father in a unique way, acting with divine authority through miracles and ultimately by rising from the dead. As a teacher, Jesus reinterprets the moral law with attention to motive and inner disposition, most famously in the Sermon on the Mount where he reframes commandments as matters of heart and intention rather than mere external conformity. This emphasis supports ethical readings that privilege conscience, virtue and agape (self-giving love). As a liberator, Jesus’ ministry consistently sides with the marginalised: his parables, healings and interactions with outcasts show a theology that addresses social as well as personal restoration. Teachers should use canonical episodes—parables of the lost son and the Good Samaritan, healings, and Jesus’ table fellowship—to show how these dimensions of Jesus’ identity translate into moral imperatives for Christians.

Students must be ready to assess competing interpretations. Some scholars push a more historical-critical portrait that emphasises Jesus’ role within first-century Jewish movements of social and religious renewal. Others stress the theological claims of the early Church about Jesus’ divine status. Theologically, questions arise about whether Jesus intended to found an exclusive path to God or to reform Jewish practice in ways that later Christianity universalised. Be prepared to explain how Christians read Jesus’ teachings as normative and how different traditions prioritise aspects of his identity.

## Christian moral principles: sources and the role of agape
Christian moral thinking draws on overlapping sources: Scripture, tradition (including teaching of the Church), and reason. Different branches of Christianity place these sources in different orders of authority. Catholic approaches commonly stress the interplay of Scripture, magisterial teaching and natural reason; many Protestant traditions elevate Scripture as the primary norm while using reason and tradition as aids; liberal Christian ethics may emphasise conscience and the primacy of love. The New Testament theme of agape—self-giving, unconditional love—often functions as a controlling moral principle. Some Christians treat agape as the single rule that governs ethical decisions; others treat it alongside rules, virtues and community norms.

When teaching moral principles, show how these sources and the idea of love operate in practice by applying them to real issues: pastoral responses to suffering, priorities in social justice, or debates about sexual ethics and medical choices. A useful classroom move is to compare an approach that insists on strict rules with one that places agape and the context of situations at the centre. Students should be able to explain and evaluate the strengths of agape-centered ethics—its responsiveness to personal dignity and its refusal to reduce persons to mere means—as well as weaknesses commonly alleged, such as vagueness and the risk of subjectivity if agape is not disciplined by communal wisdom or reasoned constraints.

## Christian moral action: Dietrich Bonhoeffer as a case study
Dietrich Bonhoeffer is an excellent exemplar for studying Christian moral action because his life forces questions about obedience, conscience and the cost of discipleship into dramatic relief. As a pastor-theologian in Nazi Germany Bonhoeffer argued that Christianity is not simply an inward piety but a public faith that must act in the world. He formed part of the Confessing Church, laboured at Finkenwalde as a community that sought spiritual formation, and later became involved in the plot to assassinate Hitler—an involvement that ultimately led to his execution.

Bonhoeffer’s ethical vocabulary includes the contrast between “cheap grace” and “costly grace.” Cheap grace offers forgiveness without repentance or ethical transformation. Costly grace, by contrast, calls disciples to radical obedience that may demand personal sacrifice. In Bonhoeffer’s thinking the Church must be a community that disciplines conscience and forms persons to act on behalf of the vulnerable, even when such action might conflict with the state. His readiness to endorse covert political action raises difficult but teachable questions. How far can Christian ethics justify breaking civil law to oppose grave injustice? How should Christians weigh the intention, foreseeable consequences, and the communal accountability of such acts? Bonhoeffer does not supply simple formulas; his example invites evaluation of the tension between prophetic resistance and the risks of political violence. For revision, students should be able to outline Bonhoeffer’s context, explain his key ideas about discipleship and costly grace, and evaluate whether his actions can be defended theologically and ethically.

## Pluralism in Christian theology: exclusivism, inclusivism and pluralism
Pluralism asks whether Christianity can claim unique access to salvation in a world of many religions. Three broad theological positions give structure to the debate. Exclusivism maintains that explicit faith in Christ is necessary for salvation. Inclusivism accepts that Christ is the decisive revelation and basis of salvation but allows that people who have not explicitly known Christ may still be saved through him—sometimes using the category of “anonymous Christians” to name those whose moral openness to truth and grace places them within Christ’s saving action. Pluralism argues that no single religious tradition has exclusive salvific truth; instead, multiple paths can lead to ultimate reality. John Hick is a familiar advocate of theological pluralism, reframing religions as culturally conditioned responses to the same ultimate reality, thus encouraging mutual recognition and equal standing between faiths.

Each position has internal varieties and challenges. Exclusivism faces pastoral and moral pressures in multicultural societies and the ethical problem of apparent divine justice if many are excluded by birth or geography. Inclusivism tries to preserve Christological centrality while answering pastoral concerns, but critics claim it can be patronising—interpreting other faiths through a Christian grid. Pluralism is praised for fostering interfaith respect but criticised for relativising truth claims, potentially undermining particular Christian convictions about revelation and incarnation. Theologically sophisticated responses attempt to hold together humility before other faiths, the uniqueness of Christ, and a robust doctrine of God’s justice and mercy. For revision, students should rehearse arguments on each side and be ready to make balanced evaluations that draw on scriptural, doctrinal and pastoral resources.

## Pluralism in practice: mission, dialogue and social life
How Christians respond to religious diversity is not only theological but practical. Mission, interfaith dialogue, and participation in plural public life all require careful thinking. Some Christian communities emphasise proclamation and conversion as acts of love; others prioritise dialogue, shared social action and the recognition of religious freedom as a public good. Practices such as scriptural reasoning—where participants from different religions study their scriptures together—illustrate how intellectual exchange can foster mutual understanding while preserving difference. In plural societies Christians must also reckon with legal pluralism, minority rights, and the need to witness ethically without coercion. When revising this area, students should connect doctrinal positions about salvation to real-world implications for mission, civic engagement, and the goal of peaceable coexistence.

## Exam technique
An effective answer combines clear knowledge (AO1) with balanced analysis and evaluation (AO2). Begin essays by briefly defining key terms and locating the issue within Christian thought. When presenting knowledge, use specific thinkers, texts and examples—mention Augustine’s view of original sin and grace, outline Bonhoeffer’s “costly grace,” or summarise exclusivism/inclusivism/pluralism—so markers can see precise recall. For analysis, explain arguments and their assumptions; for evaluation, weigh strengths and weaknesses, anticipate objections and respond to them. Aim for structure: a short introduction, two or three developed paragraphs that move from explanation to critical engagement, and a conclusion that answers the question directly. Where appropriate, bring in scripture or primary examples (for example Matthew 25 for final judgement, Confessions for Augustine, Cost of Discipleship for Bonhoeffer) to show the connection between belief and practice. Time management matters: for a two-hour paper with three essays, plan roughly 35–40 minutes per essay including a few minutes to plan; use plans to ensure your answer remains focused on the question rather than drifting into general summary. Finally, write with clarity, signal your argument, and aim for balance: examiners reward answers that both demonstrate secure knowledge and offer thoughtful, well-evidenced evaluation.
