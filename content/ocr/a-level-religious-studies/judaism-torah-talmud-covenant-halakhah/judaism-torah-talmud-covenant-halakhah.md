# Judaism: Torah, Talmud, covenant and Halakhah (A-level Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why these topics matter
The study of Torah, Talmud, covenant and Halakhah lies at the heart of Judaism as both a religion and a living way of life. For A‑level Religious Studies you need to understand not only the content of key texts and teachings but also the processes by which scripture becomes law and identity. The Torah (the written Torah or Pentateuch) provides foundational narratives and commandments; the Oral Torah and the Talmud record centuries of rabbinic interpretation and debate; covenantal themes shape Jewish self‑understanding; and Halakhah is the practical legal system through which beliefs become behaviour. Together these areas show how theology, ethics, law and community interact, and they raise critical questions about authority, continuity, adaptation and the relationship between text and lived reality — questions that are central to synoptic and evaluative exam questions.

## The Written Torah and its covenant narratives
The Torah refers most specifically to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, but as a concept it also stands for the wider canon and the formative stories that define Israel: creation, the call of Abraham, the Exodus, Sinai and the giving of the law. Covenants are the organising theological motif in these narratives. The Abrahamic covenant establishes a personal and familial relationship between God and Abraham, promising descendants, land and blessing; the Mosaic covenant at Sinai situates the Israelites as a people bound to God through a legal and ritual code. When reading these stories it is useful to note both their ancient Near Eastern background — many covenants resemble suzerainty treaties in form — and the theological emphases that make them distinct, for example the centrality of law and ethical conduct in the Mosaic material. For revision, be able to explain how themes such as chosenness, land and law interconnect and to discuss interpretative questions: is the covenant conditional or unconditional, how do successive biblical texts reinterpret covenant promises, and how have modern Jewish communities understood these covenants in relation to contemporary political realities?

## The Oral Torah and the Talmud: transmission, composition and authority
Judaism distinguishes between the written Torah and an accompanying Oral Torah, the latter understood in rabbinic tradition as an explanation of how to live out the Written Law. The Oral Torah was eventually committed to writing in the Mishnah (c. 200 CE) and the subsequent rabbinic discussions — the Gemara — which together form the Talmud. Two Talmuds exist, but the Babylonian Talmud has become the dominant source of rabbinic law and interpretation. The Talmud’s style is dialogical and dialectical: it records different opinions, hypothetical cases, ethical maxims and legal conclusions. This discursive form matters because authority in Judaism is rarely a matter of simple fiat; instead it is produced through argument, precedent and the weight of communal acceptance. For students, it helps to imagine the Talmud as both a legal manual and a record of a communal conversation about meaning, ethics and practice. Be prepared to explain how the Talmud functions as a source of law and moral teaching, how later codes and responsa draw on it, and to evaluate whether a text that records disagreement can still claim authoritative status.

## Halakhah: law, sources and method
Halakhah literally means “the way” and designates the corpus of Jewish law governing ritual, moral and social life. Its sources are layered: the Written Torah (mitzvot), the Oral Torah as preserved in Mishnah and Talmud, medieval codifiers such as Maimonides and the Shulchan Arukh, and the ongoing responsa literature produced by rabbinic authorities. Methodologically, halakhic reasoning uses hermeneutic principles, analogical inference (gezerah shavah), precedent, and pragmatic considerations about community welfare. The role of custom (minhag) and communal practice is also significant; what a community customarily does can become binding in halakhic terms. A sensitive revision answer will trace how legal authority is distributed: there is no single pope figure in Judaism; rather authority is dispersed among learned interpreters, communal institutions and historical tradition. When assessing Halakhah, consider tensions such as the demands of textual fidelity versus the pressures of moral change, and how different Jewish movements (Orthodox, Conservative/Masorti, Reform, Liberal) approach the balance between continuity and adaptation.

## Halakhah in practice: food, purity, sex and business
To make Halakhah concrete, it is helpful to study a range of practical areas where law, ethics and identity intersect. Kashrut (dietary law) regulates permitted and forbidden foods, the separation of meat and dairy, and slaughter practices such as shechita; these laws express a vision of holiness and communal distinctiveness as much as practical hygiene. Laws of family purity (niddah) and the ritual mikveh embody theological ideas about bodily sanctity and cyclical renewal; their application affects marriage, gender relations and sexuality. Halakhic approaches to commerce — prohibitions on deception, rules about interest and obligations to the poor — show how ethical imperatives are integrated into legal detail. Finally, conversion procedures illustrate how Halakhah regulates entry into the covenant community: requirements differ between streams, and modern debates about patrilineal descent and recognition of conversions show the continuing legal and communal tensions. For exam purposes, use case studies: describe the rule, explain its halakhic sources and methods, and evaluate its ethical implications and contemporary challenges.

## Covenant, identity and modern developments
Covenant theology continues to have political and cultural implications. The idea of a covenantal bond with land has shaped Jewish history, identity and modern Zionist thought, while debates about the State of Israel engage ancient covenantal language with modern nationalism and law. The Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) and subsequent emancipation in Europe prompted debates over Jewish law, integration and the need for reform. Thinkers and movements responded in different ways: some sought to reinterpret Halakhah to fit modern citizenship, others insisted on the inviolability of tradition. The catastrophes of the twentieth century, especially the Holocaust, provoked theological crisis. Post‑Holocaust thinkers raised painful questions about divine providence, covenantal trust and theodicy; some argued for rethinking classical conceptions of God, others for reasserting Jewish continuity and moral responsibility. Meanwhile, feminist theologians and activists have challenged patriarchal aspects of Halakhah, proposing new readings of Torah and new models for ritual and legal participation. When writing exam answers, be ready to link the legal texts and principles you have studied to social and historical developments, showing how law both shapes and is shaped by context.

## Maimonides, Pirkei Avot and the ethics of law
Maimonides (Rambam) is a pivotal medieval figure for both theology and law. His codifications and philosophical works attempt to provide systematic, rational foundations for belief and practice, exemplified in formulations such as his principles of faith and his efforts to translate Talmudic teaching into orderly halakhic rulings. Alongside legal codifiers, ethical texts like Pirkei Avot (Ethics of the Fathers) show another dimension of tradition: concise ethical aphorisms that guided personal character and communal conduct. Juxtaposing legal codes with ethical teachings invites productive evaluation: does law alone produce moral people, or does ethical formation demand more than compliance? For A‑level responses, draw attention to how law and ethics interact in Judaism — Halakhah supplies norms and sanctions, while texts such as Pirkei Avot articulate virtues that undergird those norms.

## Exam technique
To score highly on A‑level questions about Torah, Talmud, covenant and Halakhah, structure your essays clearly and balance description with analysis. Begin by defining key terms precisely (for example, explain what is meant by “Oral Torah” or “Halakhah”) and situate the material historically. Use specific examples: name a covenant text and outline its themes; describe a Talmudic method of argument or a halakhic ruling and its source; present a concrete halakhic case such as dietary rules or conversion procedure. When evaluating, compare perspectives (for instance, Orthodox versus Progressive approaches to conversion or to women’s roles), weigh strengths and weaknesses, and engage with the implications of each view. Always link back to the question: discuss significance, influence or coherence as required by the prompt. In longer essay questions, allocate time for a conclusion that draws your evaluative points together and states a reasoned judgement, showing awareness of ambiguity and complexity. Practice by turning classroom notes into timed essays, using primary examples from Torah, Talmud and later codes, and by developing a stock of evaluative phrases and comparative links that demonstrate synoptic thinking across belief, practice and historical change.
