# Islam: prophecy, oneness of God, Shari'a and Sufism (A-level Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

Islamic belief about revelation and prophetic authority, the oneness and nature of God, the role of law and community through the Shari'a, and the mystical path of Sufism are central topics for A‑level study. These areas are closely connected: belief in revelation shapes legal and spiritual practice, ideas about God influence theological schools and ethical decisions, and debates about textual authority determine how Muslims interpret both doctrine and daily life. This guide sets out the essential content, explains different positions and variations within Islam, and highlights the sorts of comparisons and evaluations that are useful in examination answers.

## Prophecy and revelation

Prophecy (nubuwwa) and revelation (wahy) are foundational for Muslim self‑understanding. Muslims hold that God revealed guidance to humanity through a line of prophets, culminating in Muhammad, described in Islamic doctrine as the seal of the prophets. Revelation in Islam is not merely ethical teaching: the Qur’an is understood by orthodox Muslims to be the final and complete divine message, delivered to Muhammad via the angel Gabriel (Jibril). Prophets such as Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus) are respected as carriers of earlier revelations, which Islam locates within a continuing Abrahamic framework. The significance of the prophetic model is practical as well as doctrinal: prophets are exemplars whose lives, as preserved in the sira (biographical material) and hadith (reports of the Prophet’s words and actions), supply moral guidance and interpretive context for scripture.

Studying prophecy also means examining how revelation is received and preserved. The Qur’an’s status as verbatim revelation for many Muslims leads to strong claims about its authority and immutability. The Hadith literature and the Sira are treated as authoritative in Sunni and Shi’a traditions but they are subject to different methods of authentication, classification and use. The reliability of hadith collections, the process of transmission (isnad), and the interpretive work of scholars are important topics because they explain why different communities accept different texts and rulings. In class and exam answers, it is useful to show awareness of the distinction between the Qur’an as primary scripture and the Hadith/Sira as complementary but interpretive sources.

## Tradition, Hadith and authority: Sunni and Shi’a perspectives

The Sunni and Shi’a traditions agree on the centrality of Muhammad and the Qur’an but differ over succession, authority and the role of particular figures. Early disputes about leadership after Muhammad’s death generated divergent narratives about the early community and produced different emphases in religious authority. Sunni Islam places weight on the community (umma), consensus (ijmaʿ) and the scholarly schools (madhhab) as mechanisms for interpreting the law. Shiʿa Islam, by contrast, emphasizes the family of the Prophet (ahl‑al‑bayt) and a line of divinely guided Imams who provide authoritative interpretation; in many Shiʿa formulations the Imams possess a special status as infallible guides.

Hadith collections and the Sira are central to legal reasoning, ethical exemplars and devotional life, but they are interpreted and authenticated in different ways across schools. The process by which jurists developed methods to evaluate chains of transmission and the content of reports is part of the reason for diversity of practice. When answering questions, students should show how these institutional differences affect theology, law and communal identity, and illustrate claims with examples such as contrasting Sunni reliance on consensus and madhhabs with Shiʿa emphasis on imamological authority.

## God is One: tawhid and theological schools

Tawhid, the absolute oneness and uniqueness of God, is the touchstone of Islamic theology. The Qur’an insists on divine unity and transcendence, and classical theology developed doctrines to protect this notion from anthropomorphism or conceptual division. Yet human language and scripture sometimes attribute human qualities to God, and theologians have debated how to make sense of such descriptions. Approaches range from emphasizing literal divine attributes to reading anthropomorphic language metaphorically or by negation.

Two major medieval schools illustrate the range of responses. The Muʿtazilites argued for a strong rationalism in theology, affirming divine unity by denying attributes that compromise God’s simplicity; they tended to emphasize human free will and moral responsibility. The Ashʿarite school reacted against some Muʿtazilite conclusions by insisting that divine attributes are real and that God’s will ultimately determines truth; Ashʿarites often stressed divine omnipotence and the limits of human reason to fully comprehend God. Hanbali tendencies, and later theological currents, sometimes favour a more literal reading of scriptural expressions while avoiding full anthropomorphism by asserting that God is unlike creation in every respect.

For the A‑level student, it is helpful to frame these debates around key questions: how do Muslims reconcile divine transcendence with scriptural language that seems human? Is reason an adequate tool for theology or must revelation have interpretive primacy? Answers are stronger when supported by specific theological positions and by explaining how these positions influence worship, law and ethics in Muslim communities.

## Human destiny, eschatology and the problem of divine will

Islamic teaching on human destiny links closely to tawhid and to views about divine justice. The Qur’anic narrative includes accounts of life after death, the intermediary state (barzakh), resurrection on the Day of Judgment, and final reward or punishment. These eschatological teachings have ethical force: belief in accountability motivates moral behaviour and shapes legal priorities.

Debates about divine will and human action are central here. The Muʿtazilite emphasis on human responsibility contrasts with Ashʿarite doctrines that highlight divine predetermination, and later theologians and jurists developed nuanced positions to reconcile divine omniscience and omnipotence with human moral agency. Al‑Ghazali is a key figure to study for this area because his own intellectual development involved critique of philosophical determinism and a turn towards mystical experience; his writings illustrate attempts to hold together faith, reason and spiritual practice. Students should be prepared to explain the moral and pastoral implications of different stances on predestination, including how they affect notions of justice, repentance and legal culpability.

## The Shari’a: sources, interpretation and contemporary application

Shari’a is the normative framework that, in theory, expresses God’s will for human conduct. In practice the Shari’a is mediated through human jurisprudence (fiqh), which uses sources and methods to derive specific rules. The primary sources recognised across Sunni schools are the Qur’an and the Sunna (the Prophet’s tradition as recorded in hadith and sira). Secondary mechanisms of legal reasoning include consensus (ijmaʿ), analogical reasoning (qiyas), and, in later periods, principles such as consideration of public interest (maslaha). The work of jurists (mujtahids) in applying these tools is known as ijtihad; the counter‑movement to innovation is taqlid, the following of established scholarly precedent. The interaction of ijtihad and taqlid explains both continuity and change in Islamic legal interpretation.

Studying the Shari’a also requires attention to the four main Sunni madhhabs—Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʿi and Hanbali—and to Shiʿa legal traditions, each of which has its own methods and emphases. In modern contexts the implications of Shari’a for banking, criminal law, medical ethics and public policy raise challenging questions: how should jurists apply centuries‑old principles to new technologies and globalised economies? Contemporary responses range from conservative insistence on preserving classical rulings to reformist arguments for renewed ijtihad and for prioritising maqasid al‑Shariʿa (the higher objectives of the law such as preservation of life, property and dignity). Exemplifying these debates in essays—by showing how analogical reasoning produced rulings on interest and tobacco, or how maslaha has been used to argue for public health measures—strengthens the student’s analysis.

## Sufism: aims, practices and impact

Sufism represents the mystical tendency within Islam that focuses on inner purification (tazkiyat al‑nafs), the cultivation of spiritual virtues and direct experience of the Divine. Sufi concern for ihsan, often summarised as the pursuit of excellence in worship and consciousness of God, roots itself in the prophetic tradition and in the Qur’anic exhortation to remember God. Practice varies widely: dhikr (remembrance through repeated phrases or silent contemplation), samaʿ (listening to devotional music and poetry), and disciplined ethical training under a spiritual guide (shaykh) are characteristic elements.

Sufism speaks a different language from jurisprudence and scholastic theology; its metaphors—annihilation of the self (fanaʾ), subsistence in God (baqaʾ), and the ladder of spiritual stations—aim to articulate the transformative process rather than to legislate action. The tariqa, or Sufi path, structures instruction through initiation and guidance, and the master‑disciple relationship is central to the transmission of inner states. Figures such as Jalal al‑Din Rumi are studied for their poetic expression of Sufi experience, while al‑Ghazali’s movement from philosophical scepticism to Sufi devotion provides a case study of intellectual and spiritual synthesis.

Sufism’s relationship with wider Islamic life is complex: it has provided popular devotional practice, influenced ethics and theology, and sometimes clashed with legalistic or puritanical movements. When evaluating Sufism, students should consider both its role in popular piety and its intellectual contributions, as well as criticisms from other Muslim currents that question ecstatic practices or perceived innovations.

## Exam technique

Top‑grade answers combine clear knowledge with critical evaluation and are structured to meet both assessment objectives. For AO1 aim to demonstrate precise factual knowledge: define key terms (for example tawhid, ijtihad, barzakh, dhikr), outline distinctive beliefs or practices, and show awareness of variation within Islam by naming positions and schools (Muʿtazilite, Ashʿari, Hanafi, Shafiʿi, Shiʿa, major Sufi concepts). For AO2 develop balanced argumentation: present strengths and weaknesses of positions, compare rival accounts, and weigh contemporary implications. Begin essays with a brief plan that signals the route of your answer, and use paragraphing so that each paragraph has a clear point supported by evidence and followed by evaluation.

Use primary sources selectively: references to Qur’anic themes and to well‑known hadith reinforce claims, but always explain their significance and how interpretations differ. Bring in scholars and thinkers like al‑Ghazali to illustrate theological and historical developments, and explain how their ideas shaped practice or thought. When discussing Shari’a or theology, always consider practical consequences and modern debates; examiners reward answers which connect belief to lived religion and to present‑day issues.

Counterbalance description with analysis: after explaining a school’s view, interrogate its coherence, implications and counter‑arguments. For instance, when discussing Ashʿarite emphasis on divine omnipotence assess how that view handles moral responsibility, and contrast it with the Muʿtazilite insistence on human freedom. In Sufism, explain both spiritual aims and the rational critiques offered by other Muslims. Where appropriate, conclude by indicating the strengths of different approaches and, if asked, take a reasoned position while acknowledging limitations.

Time management is essential. For a two‑hour paper with three essays, aim to spend roughly 40 minutes on each 40‑mark essay, leaving a few minutes at the end to review. Use the question wording: if it asks for “compare and contrast” or “assess”, ensure you do that explicitly. Support claims with examples, signal when you are evaluating, and avoid unsupported assertions. Practice planning quick essay outlines under timed conditions, and revise key terms, scholars and scriptural themes so you can deploy them confidently in answers.
