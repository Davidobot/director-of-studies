# Meta-ethics and conscience (naturalism, emotivism; Aquinas vs Freud) (A-level Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What is meta-ethics and why it matters
Meta-ethics asks what we mean when we make moral claims. Rather than telling us which actions are right or wrong, meta-ethics asks whether moral statements are the sort of things that can be true or false, whether they describe features in the world, whether they express emotions, or whether they are grounded in some non-natural moral reality. This matters for A-level Religious Studies because different meta-ethical positions shape how we interpret ethical theories and the status of conscience. If moral language is descriptive and objective, then ethical debate aims at truth. If moral language is expressive or persuasive, then ethical debate is a clash of attitudes. For students this distinction affects how to evaluate ethical arguments, how to use thinkers in answers, and how to analyse the idea that conscience provides moral knowledge.

## Naturalism: moral facts as part of the natural world
Ethical naturalism holds that moral properties are part of the natural order and can, in principle, be discovered or reduced to natural facts. Under this view words like ‘good’ or ‘wrong’ ultimately refer to natural properties such as pleasure, human flourishing, or the fulfilment of a biological or social telos. A classic strength of naturalism is its promise of objectivity: if moral claims are about natural features, they can be debated using evidence and reason in a way comparable to scientific claims. This helps to make ethical enquiry seem rigorous and usable in public policy or applied ethics. Critics of naturalism raise the ‘is–ought’ problem, the claim that no amount of description about what is can by itself yield what ought to be. There is also the charge of the naturalistic fallacy: the idea that defining ‘good’ purely by natural terms begs the question and misses something essential about moral value. In classroom work it is useful to show how a naturalist might respond by arguing that human well-being is precisely the kind of thing moral language aims to track, and to set this against the objection that any reduction loses the normative force of moral words.

## Emotivism and non-cognitivism: ethics as feeling and persuasion
Emotivism is a non-cognitive meta-ethical position which claims that ethical sentences do not describe states of the world but express the speaker’s attitudes, emotions or prescriptions. When someone says ‘Stealing is wrong’ they are not reporting a fact but expressing disapproval and perhaps seeking to influence others. Emotivism helps to explain apparent differences in moral moods and why moral disagreements often feel like clashes of attitude. It also links to the idea that moral language has a function beyond truth-telling: to motivate, praise, blame, or coordinate behaviour. Emotivism faces challenges. If moral claims are merely expressions of feeling, how do we account for moral argument and persuasion that seem to aim at rational conviction rather than mere expression? Emotivists answer that argument changes attitudes by giving reasons that alter feelings indirectly, but critics insist this cannot recover the sense that moral debate seeks truth. For teaching, contrasting emotivism with positions that treat moral words as true or false helps students practise analysis of sample arguments and spot where philosophers move from description to prescription.

## Other meta-ethical positions: intuitionism and the debate about meaning
To situate naturalism and emotivism it helps to know alternative views. Intuitionism maintains that moral truths are known directly by rational intuition and are not reducible to natural properties. This approach preserves the idea of moral knowledge while avoiding some naturalist problems. It supports the common-sense view that people can simply know that something is right or wrong without empirical proof. Criticism focuses on the apparent subjectivity of intuition and the lack of a reliable method to arbitrate conflicting intuitions. In practice, A-level answers benefit from showing awareness of these alternatives: a balanced response to naturalism or emotivism is stronger if it recognises intuitionism as a live competitor and examines whether it actually solves or simply relocates the philosophical difficulties.

## Aquinas on conscience: reason, synderesis and practical judgement
Thomas Aquinas treats conscience as an application of practical reason within a broader natural law framework. For Aquinas there is an inner principle that inclines humans to good — synderesis — which provides the basic orientation towards what is good. Conscientia is the act of reason applying universal moral principles to particular situations, producing a judgement about what to do. Aquinas therefore treats conscience as both cognitive and normative: it is a faculty that can know moral truth and move the agent to action. He also recognises that conscience can err: a sincerely held but mistaken judgement still binds the agent to follow it unless the ignorance is vincible, that is, the agent could and should have known better. This nuanced position links moral knowledge to reason, to human nature, and ultimately to a divine order that gives moral norms their intelligibility. In teaching, Aquinas is valuable because he bridges theology and ethics: his model explains why conscience can have authority while admitting fallibility, and his categories (synderesis, conscientia, vincible/invincible ignorance) give students precise vocabulary for exam answers.

## Freud on conscience: psychological origins and the superego
Sigmund Freud locates conscience within psychological development rather than metaphysical order. Conscience, on this account, is the superego: the internalisation of parental and societal prohibitions during early childhood. It functions by policing impulses, generating feelings of guilt, and enforcing conformity to internalised authority. Freud’s account is explanatory and reductionist: what we call moral insight is traceable to psychological mechanisms and family dynamics, not to a faculty that accesses moral truth. The Freudian picture challenges traditional moral theology by explaining moral experience without recourse to divine law or rational intuition. Freud’s approach invites critical questions about moral responsibility: if guilt stems from internalised parental commands, does the feeling of guilt reliably indicate wrongdoing, or might it simply reflect oppressive social conditioning? For teaching, Freud is a useful foil to Aquinas because he draws attention to the social and psychological sources of moral feelings and the risks of treating conscience as automatically authoritative.

## Aquinas versus Freud: comparison and implications for ethics
Putting Aquinas and Freud side by side highlights contrasting answers to two central questions: what is conscience and what is its authority? Aquinas sees conscience as reasoned judgement rooted in an objective moral order; Freud sees conscience as psychological structure rooted in socialisation. The practical implications are profound. On Aquinas’s view conscience can guide moral decision-making and provide reasons for action; on Freud’s view conscience explains why people feel guilt and moral pressure, but its content may not be reliable as moral truth. This difference feeds into meta-ethical debate. If Freud is right and conscience is psychologically produced, it does not follow that moral claims are false, but it does undercut the claim that conscience by itself provides epistemic access to moral reality. Conversely, Aquinas’s position faces the challenge of explaining how reason reliably tracks moral truth in the face of cultural disagreement and psychological bias. Teaching this comparison benefits from concrete examples. Consider a doctor asked about voluntary euthanasia. An Aquinas-influenced account will test the action against natural law precepts and the operation of conscientia, examining whether conscience is informed or ignorant. A Freudian analysis will explore the patient’s family pressures, the cultural background of the doctor, and how internalised prohibitions shape expressed moral positions. Good exam answers weigh these perspectives, showing that psychological explanation and moral justification play different roles and that explaining conscience psychologically does not automatically dissolve the normative question about what ought to be done.

## Applying theory to practice and classroom activities
To make these abstract debates accessible, use real-life scenarios and structured comparisons. Present students with short case studies — for example, a whistleblower facing sack, a teenager deciding about sex, or a doctor confronted with a terminal patient seeking euthanasia — and ask them to articulate what a naturalist, an emotivist, Aquinas and Freud would say about the moral status of the action. Encourage students to practise building AO1 by defining terms such as ‘naturalism’, ‘emotivism’, ‘synderesis’, and ‘superego’, and then to develop AO2 by evaluating strengths, weaknesses and implications. When teaching naturalism, ask students whether moral science is possible and whether well-being can be operationalised. When teaching emotivism, stage a debate to show how emotive language works in persuasion and why critics say it fails to capture the normative force of ethics. With conscience, run short role-plays where one student plays a person following conscience and another interrogates whether that conscience is informed or a product of upbringing. These activities help learners understand not just the content but how to use the thinkers in argument, which is exactly what examiners reward.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on meta-ethics and conscience make precise definitions your opening move and use them to frame the rest of the essay. Demonstrate AO1 by clearly explaining positions such as naturalism and emotivism, and by outlining Aquinas’s and Freud’s accounts of conscience using the correct terminology. Move from exposition to analysis by showing the implications of each view: what follows for moral argument, for responsibility, and for practical ethics. Balance your answer by evaluating strengths and weaknesses, and make explicit comparisons: does Freud’s psychological explanation undermine Aquinas’s claim that conscience can access moral truth? Use examples to illustrate abstract points and, where relevant, apply positions to ethical dilemmas to show understanding of practical consequences. In longer essays aim for a clear structure with an introduction that maps your argument, body paragraphs each dealing with a single claim or counter-claim, and a conclusion that judges the issue. Remember the assessment objectives: AO1 rewards accurate and comprehensive knowledge, AO2 rewards sustained analysis and well-supported evaluation. Time management matters; plan briefly before writing and leave a few minutes to check that definitions are precise, that counter-arguments have been addressed, and that your final conclusion answers the question directly rather than introducing new material. Practice past-style questions under timed conditions and use feedback to refine clarity, balance and the use of philosophers’ ideas as supporting evidence rather than mere name-dropping.
