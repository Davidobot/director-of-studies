# Religious language: via negativa, analogy and symbolism (A-level Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why religious language matters
Religious language is not simply a set of vocabulary items; it is the way believers try to describe, know and relate to what they take to be ultimate reality. At A-level you will be asked not only to explain different theories about how religious language functions, but also to evaluate whether such language is meaningful and useful. Three central approaches appear repeatedly in the OCR specification and in exam questions: the via negativa (apophatic theology), analogy (especially the approaches associated with Thomas Aquinas), and symbolism (notably the account offered by Paul Tillich). Each approach offers a different account of how humans can talk about God, the divine or ultimate reality, and each faces its own philosophical challenges. Knowing the key ideas and some clear examples will help you to show AO1 knowledge and to deploy AO2 evaluation effectively.

## Via negativa (apophatic theology)
Via negativa, also called apophatic theology, argues that the best way to speak about God is by denying predicates: we say what God is not rather than what God is. This approach goes back to early Christian thinkers such as Pseudo-Dionysius and has been developed in various mystical traditions. The central claim is that God is transcendent and ineffable, so any positive description risks projecting human categories onto the divine. Saying “God is not finite” or “God is not subject to change” preserves divine mystery and avoids the distortions of anthropomorphism. Via negativa is often defended on pastoral and theological grounds: humility before mystery is a virtue, and negative theology guards against idolatry of human concepts.

There are practical and philosophical consequences to the apophatic approach. On the one hand it can protect the integrity of divine transcendence and provide a language of reverence for religious practice and mystical experience. On the other hand it can be accused of leaving believers with silence or emptiness: if all we can say is what God is not, have we said anything at all that supports religious belief? Critics press the point that denial alone may be uninformative and that negations presuppose positive concepts. Defenders respond that via negativa points beyond concepts to an encounter or experience in which words fail; the approach therefore complements other forms of religious expression rather than replacing them.

## Analogy: Aquinas’s cataphatic strategy
Whereas the via negativa stresses what cannot be said about God, the via positiva seeks positive ways of speaking. Thomas Aquinas famously tried to bridge the gap between human language and divine reality through the theory of analogy. For Aquinas ordinary univocal language (words having exactly the same meaning when applied to different things) fails when applied to God. Instead he proposes two forms of analogy: attribution and proportion. Analogy of attribution allows us to speak of God in terms derived from creatures by attributing effects to their cause. For example, when we call a human “wise” because they possess wisdom, and call God “wise” because God is the source of wisdom, the meaning is related but not identical. Analogy of proportion holds that terms applied to God and creatures are proportionately related: “good” when predicated of a person means something analogous to “good” when predicated of God, but the divine good is infinitely greater.

Aquinas’s scheme aims to preserve both the meaningfulness and the transcendence of theological language. It avoids literal anthropomorphism by denying that predicates are used in the same univocal sense, but it allows positive predication in a qualified way. Critics have questioned whether analogy merely masks equivocation or whether it provides sufficient cognitive content to support theological claims. Supporters argue that analogy is the best available way to speak meaningfully about a being whose nature exceeds human comprehension, and that it underpins much of historical Christian theology, sacramental language and doctrinal formulations.

## Symbolism: Tillich and the religious symbol
Paul Tillich offers a different way of understanding religious language by focusing on symbols. For Tillich religious language functions symbolically: symbols participate in the reality to which they point, they open up levels of reality that are otherwise closed to us, and they give access to ultimate concerns. A symbol is more than a sign; it is an expressive medium that both points beyond itself and participates in the transcendent reality. For example, the cross is not merely a historical object or a sign but a symbol that embodies suffering, redemption and a structure of meaning for Christians.

Tillich’s account allows religious language to be meaningful in a non-literal, existential way. Symbols carry emotional and existential content and can disclose truths that literal descriptions cannot reach. Critics, however, worry that if religious language is purely symbolic then it becomes non-cognitive: symbols express feelings and attitudes rather than truth-apt propositions about objective reality. Defenders of Tillich counter that symbols do have cognitive content of a kind, because they disclose grounded truths about human existential conditions and their relation to the ultimate.

## Twentieth-century challenges: verification, falsification and language games
The early twentieth-century movement of logical positivism posed a significant challenge to traditional religious language. The verification principle proposed by thinkers such as A.J. Ayer held that a statement is meaningful only if it is empirically verifiable or tautologically true. Many religious statements fail this test and are therefore diagnosed as meaningless. In response, philosophers and theologians developed several alternative strategies.

One route was to argue that religious language functions differently from empirical claims. Wittgenstein’s later idea of language games and forms of life allows religious language to be meaningful within its own practices. On this view, religious utterances make sense as part of a distinctive form of life; they do not compete with scientific statements on the same criteria. The falsification debate, sparked by Antony Flew and others, forced sharper analysis. Flew proposed a parable of the gardener to argue that religious claims persist in the face of disconfirming evidence in a way that makes them unfalsifiable and thus meaningless. R.M. Hare introduced the notion of a “blik” — a non-falsifiable worldview or attitude that shapes interpretation of experience. John Hick and others argued for reinterpretations of religious language that place it in a wider epistemological framework.

These twentieth-century debates are central for exam answers because they take the discussion from abstract theology into the terrain of philosophy of language. Your responses should show awareness of how each theory treats meaningfulness, how it engages with verification or falsification, and whether it preserves the cognitive or non-cognitive status of religious claims.

## Comparing the three approaches: strengths, weaknesses and synthesis
Each approach—via negativa, analogy and symbolism—addresses a genuine problem about language and the divine, and each has characteristic strengths. Via negativa preserves transcendence and guards against idolatry of concepts. Analogy supplies a disciplined way to make positive predications without collapsing God into human categories. Symbolism captures the existential depth and participatory quality of religious experience and practice.

At the same time each approach faces problems. The apophatic route risks sterile silence or claims that are too negative to motivate belief. Analogy must answer whether it has sufficient determinate content to support theological claims or whether it simply reintroduces equivocation in a subtler form. Symbolism must explain whether symbolic language can make truth claims about objective reality or whether it is confined to subjective expression. Philosophers such as Swinburne seek to defend meaningfulness in religious language by providing criteria that allow cognitive claims, while others like Wittgenstein and Tillich accept a non-propositional, practice-based account.

A balanced synthetic answer often serves well in examination essays. You can argue, for instance, that via negativa and analogy operate at different registers—apophaticism tempering cataphatic claims—while symbolism explains how doctrines and rituals make relational and existential sense to believers. Evaluative discussion should consider the aims of religious language: if its primary function is to make metaphysical truth claims, then stricter epistemic tests might be required; if its function is to express devotion, shape community and transform lives, then criteria of meaning shift and the language-games or symbolic accounts gain force.

## Classroom examples and clarification for teaching
Concrete examples help fix these theories in students’ minds. To teach via negativa, set Pseudo-Dionysius alongside mystical texts that emphasise silence; contrast statements like “God is love” with negative counterparts such as “God is not limited.” For analogy, bring Aquinas’ examples of “wise man” and “wise God” and work through attribution and proportion with simple analogies (e.g., a sun giving light to lamps). When covering Tillich, use the cross as a living symbol and ask students to explain how it both points beyond itself and participates in a religious reality. Use the falsification parable of the gardener, and Wittgenstein’s notion of language games, to show differing criteria for meaningfulness. Encourage learners to practise answering questions that require both explanation and evaluation: they should give clear definitions, show understanding of thinkers and texts, and then critically analyse strengths and weaknesses with precise examples.

When preparing essays, students should be ready to compare approaches directly. For example, a question asking whether religious language is cognitive invites discussion of Ayer’s verificationism, Flew’s falsification challenge, Wittgenstein’s language games and Aquinas’s analogical theism. An essay on the via negativa will benefit from linking to mystical testimony and to Tillich’s symbol account, showing how they overlap and differ.

## Exam technique
In answer planning begin by defining the key terms quickly and accurately: explain apophatic and cataphatic, note what is meant by ‘analogy’ and ‘symbol’. In the body of the essay display AO1 by outlining the main theories: Pseudo-Dionysius and mysticism for via negativa, Aquinas’s analogy of attribution and proportion for analogy, and Tillich’s theory of symbol for symbolism. Use brief textual or historical examples to anchor each theory. For AO2, evaluate each position: outline the principal objections (for example, that via negativa is empty, that analogy is equivocal, that symbolism is non-cognitive) and then offer counter-arguments and defences. Bring in twentieth-century debates on meaningfulness—verificationism, falsification and Wittgenstein—to show awareness of wider philosophical challenges. Aim to compare and synthesise rather than rehearse separate accounts in isolation; examiners reward integrated discussion that connects theories and shows how they illuminate and limit one another. Always finish with a clear, balanced conclusion that answers the question and summarises your evaluative position, showing how the weight of argument supports your judgement.
