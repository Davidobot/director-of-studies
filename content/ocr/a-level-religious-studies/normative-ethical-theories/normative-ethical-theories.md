# Normative ethical theories: Natural Law, Situation Ethics, Kant, Utilitarianism (A-level Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

Normative ethics asks what we ought to do and why. The OCR A‑level Religion and Ethics component requires students to understand four central normative theories: Natural Law and Situation Ethics as religious approaches, and Kantian ethics and Utilitarianism as non‑religious, philosophical systems. Each offers a different way of making moral decisions: some appeal to reason and universal duties, others to consequences or to love as the guiding principle. Good revision focuses on the core claims of each theory, how they are applied to real issues, the main strengths and weaknesses, and how to evaluate them in essay form.

## Natural Law (Aquinas and the Aristotelian background)

Natural Law is a teleological, broadly theistic theory that reaches back to Aristotle and is developed in Christian form most famously by Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas inherits Aristotle’s idea of telos — that things have an end or purpose — and connects this to a moral order grounded in God. He distinguishes four kinds of law: Eternal Law (God’s reason governing the universe), Divine Law (special revelation), Natural Law (the participation of rational creatures in Eternal Law, discoverable by reason), and Human Law (man‑made regulations). At the heart of Natural Law are the primary precepts, general goods such as the preservation of life, the ordering of society, the worship of God, the education of children, and the reproduction of the species; secondary precepts derive from these and apply reason to particular situations.

Natural Law aims to provide objective moral guidance: actions that fulfil human telos are good, those that frustrate it are wrong. The doctrine of double effect, associated with Aquinas, permits actions that have both good and bad effects if the bad effect is not directly intended and if there is a proportionate reason. Natural Law is particularly influential in Catholic moral teaching and is often applied to bioethical questions, sexual ethics, and law. Criticisms include questions about whether human nature really has a single telos, how to resolve conflicts between precepts, whether the theory can accommodate modern scientific understandings of human nature, and whether it can yield practical guidance in messy, plural societies.

## Situation Ethics (Joseph Fletcher and agape)

Situational or Situation Ethics arose in the mid‑20th century as a Christian alternative to legalistic rule‑based ethics. Joseph Fletcher proposed that the one moral norm is love — agape, an unconditional, self‑giving love modelled on the New Testament — and that moral decisions should be made case by case. Fletcher formulated six propositions showing love as the only intrinsic good and six working principles to guide application: pragmatism, relativism, positivism, and personalism are core features. He reframes conscience not as a guide of fixed rules but as an active verb, the process of making loving decisions in situations.

Situation Ethics is appealing because it centres human flourishing and compassion, and it can handle exceptional cases where rigid rules seem cruel. Classic examples include lying to save an innocent life or prioritising care for the vulnerable over abstract rules. Critiques argue that Fletcher’s approach makes morality too subjective, that “love” is ambiguous and can be used to justify harmful acts, and that without rules there is no reliable protection for justice or rights. Many students find it productive to compare Fletcher to Natural Law: both are religiously rooted but one insists on absolute moral goods while the other emphasises concrete loving action.

## Kantian ethics (duty, universalisability and respect)

Immanuel Kant offers a deontological framework that bases morality on reason and duty rather than consequences. His core idea is the categorical imperative: an unconditional moral command that applies to all rational agents. Kant gives several formulations of it that are used in A‑level study. The first formulation asks you to act only on maxims that you can will to become universal laws; the second requires treating humanity always as an end in itself and never merely as a means; the third envisages a kingdom of ends, a community of rational agents legislating universal moral law. Kant contrasts the categorical imperative with hypothetical imperatives, which depend on particular desires.

Kantian ethics emphasizes autonomy, the intrinsic worth of persons, and moral consistency. It offers clear tools to evaluate actions: can the maxim be universalised? Does the action disrespect persons? Kant also argues for moral postulates — freedom, immortality of the soul, and God — as necessary assumptions for the moral life. Common criticisms include Kant’s apparent rigidity (insisting on duties even when consequences seem catastrophic), his difficulty with conflicting duties, and whether universalisation is always decisive in complex moral situations. Kant is valuable in exams because his formulations allow precise application and criticism, and because his insistence on dignity supports many contemporary human‑rights arguments.

## Utilitarianism (Bentham, Mill, act and rule variants)

Utilitarianism is a teleological, consequentialist theory that evaluates actions by their outcomes: the morally right act is the one that produces the greatest overall utility, usually conceived as pleasure or happiness. Jeremy Bentham introduced the hedonic calculus, a method for measuring pleasure and pain by criteria such as intensity, duration and certainty. John Stuart Mill refined utilitarianism by distinguishing higher and lower pleasures, arguing that some pleasures (intellectual or moral) are qualitatively superior to mere sensation. Within utilitarianism, act utilitarianism judges each action by its direct consequences, while rule utilitarianism supports rules that tend to promote utility overall.

Utilitarianism’s strengths are its clarity, egalitarian concern (all interests count equally), and its practical appeal for policymaking and ethics in the public sphere. It is often applied in debates over resource allocation, business ethics, and public policy. Objections focus on demandingness (it can require extreme self‑sacrifice), the problem of justice (majorities could justify harming minorities if utility increases), difficulties in measuring and comparing pleasures, and the neglect of moral rights or motives. In exams, illustrating these objections with real scenarios — sacrificing one to save many, or endorsing apparently unjust acts because of aggregate benefits — demonstrates understanding.

## How these theories apply and clash in practice

When applying these theories to real problems, differences become stark. Consider euthanasia. Natural Law typically opposes intentional killing because it contravenes the primary precept of the preservation of life, though double effect can permit withdrawal of treatment when death is not intended. Situation Ethics evaluates the loving thing in context: voluntary euthanasia to relieve unbearable suffering might be the most loving choice. Kant would refuse euthanasia if the maxim involved treating persons as means or used a maxim that could not be universalised, though debates exist about whether suicide or assisted death could be universalised; Kant’s emphasis on autonomy complicates simple answers. Utilitarianism would support or oppose euthanasia depending on consequences for the patient, family and society, and a careful utilitarian analysis might even favour legalising assisted dying to reduce overall suffering.

In business ethics, Kantian theory highlights respect for persons: deceptive practices or exploitation fail because they use employees or customers as means. Utilitarianism evaluates corporate policies by their social utility and might justify profit maximisation if it produces overall benefits, while Natural Law stresses ordered social life and the common good, often criticising practices that undermine human dignity. Situation Ethics could focus on the particular persons affected and seek loving resolutions beyond profit rules.

Sexual ethics offers another illuminating comparison. Natural Law draws on human telos and reproduction to inform teachings on sex, often rejecting contraception or non‑procreative sexual acts. Situation Ethics would ask whether actions express agape in context. Kantian analysis centres consent and respect for persons, rejecting sexual uses that instrumentalise others. Utilitarianism examines pleasures and harms, and modern utilitarians might emphasise consent and overall well‑being over traditional prohibitions.

## Strengths, weaknesses and cross‑theory evaluation

Each theory provides distinctive resources. Natural Law gives an objective moral vocabulary and continuity with tradition, useful where law and religion intersect. Situation Ethics recovers the moral importance of love and compassion in difficult, unique cases. Kantian ethics secures moral dignity, duty and universalisability, serving as a strong basis for human rights. Utilitarianism supplies a public, outcome‑focused method adaptable to policy and collective decision‑making.

Yet none is free from serious problems. Natural Law struggles in pluralist secular contexts and with empirical claims about human nature. Situation Ethics risks subjectivity and justifying partiality if “love” is misapplied. Kant can be too formalist and insensitive to consequences; utilitarianism can sacrifice individual justice for aggregate welfare and faces practical measurement problems. Strong exam answers show balanced appraisal: acknowledging what each theory can explain convincingly, and where it falls short, and considering hybrid or complementary approaches (for example, rule utilitarianism’s attempt to secure justice, or Kantian respect supplemented by consequentialist insights in policy).

## Making theory work in an OCR A‑level answer

For high‑quality responses, link theory to the OCR specification’s expectations. Demonstrate clear AO1 knowledge by defining terms such as telos, agape, categorical imperative, hedonic calculus, primary and secondary precepts. Use named thinkers (Aquinas, Fletcher, Kant, Bentham, Mill) and explain key formulations. For AO2, analyse and evaluate: apply theories to specific moral dilemmas, raise plausible counterarguments, and consider responses the theorists (or modern defenders) might offer. Comparative judgments are valuable: explain why one theory gives a different verdict from another and assess which account you find more persuasive and why, supported by reasoned examples.

## Exam technique

Always begin essays by briefly defining the theory and locating it in the broader ethical landscape (teleological vs deontological, religious vs secular). For each paragraph of description, aim for clarity and precision: explain central concepts and, where appropriate, give a short example to show how the theory works. In evaluation, structure your critique: identify a coherent objection, explain its force, then offer a possible defence or concession. Use named scholars and texts when relevant to display AO1 knowledge, but prioritise clear explanation in your own words. When applying theories to issues, set out the scenario succinctly, apply each theory step by step, and then compare outcomes — examiners reward clear contrasting conclusions. Manage timing so you have space for a concluding paragraph that weighs the strengths and weaknesses and reaches a supported judgement; a strong conclusion does not have to settle the debate definitively but should explain which aspects you find most convincing and why. Finally, practice writing under timed conditions, plan answers briefly before writing, and use philosophical language accurately — terms like universalisability, agape, telos, categorical imperative, hedonic calculus, and doctrine of double effect should appear correctly and be explained.
