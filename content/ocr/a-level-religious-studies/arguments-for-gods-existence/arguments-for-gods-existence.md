# Arguments for God's existence (teleological, cosmological, ontological) (A-level Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction
Arguments for the existence of God form a central part of the philosophy of religion on the OCR A‑level specification. At heart these arguments attempt to show, by reasoning alone or by appeal to the world we experience, that the existence of a divine being is either highly probable or logically necessary. They fall into two broad families: a posteriori arguments, which are grounded in observation and experience (notably the teleological and cosmological arguments), and a priori arguments, which rely on conceptual or logical analysis (the ontological argument). Each argument has a long intellectual history, from medieval theologians such as Thomas Aquinas and Anselm, through Enlightenment critics like David Hume and Immanuel Kant, to contemporary reformulations. For revision it is important to understand both the structure of each argument and the main objections and responses, since exam questions expect clear explanation (AO1) and sustained critical evaluation (AO2). Throughout these topics, technical concepts such as ‘necessary being’, ‘contingent being’, ‘a priori’, and ‘a posteriori’ should be explained and used carefully.

## The teleological argument (design)
The teleological argument reasons from order, purpose or apparent design in nature to the existence of a designer. In its classical form William Paley’s watch analogy is the exemplar: finding a watch with complex, interdependent parts leads us naturally to infer a watchmaker, because complexity and purposeful organisation are best explained by intelligence. Aquinas’ Fifth Way presents a related idea: natural bodies that lack knowledge act towards an end, and since they cannot aim at their ends unless directed by something with intelligence, there must be an intelligent director—God.

Criticisms are central to assessment. Hume argued that the analogy between human artefacts and the universe is weak: the universe is unique and cannot be meaningfully compared to machines; the designer, if inferred, might be finite, multiple or imperfect; and the presence of disorder and suffering undermines a benevolent designer. Darwinian biology posed a decisive empirical challenge: natural selection explains adaptive complexity without invoking design, showing how order can arise through unguided processes over time. In response, modern defenders sometimes switch to probabilistic and cosmological forms. The contemporary fine‑tuning argument appeals to physical constants: the point is not biological adaptation but the striking precision in the laws and constants that allow life to exist. Advocates claim such fine‑tuning is best explained by a creative intelligence (or by a multiverse hypothesis as an alternative). For exam answers, it is useful to contrast the older analogical approach with modern probabilistic and anthropic formulations and to show understanding of how evolutionary theory affects the force of design arguments about biological complexity.

## The cosmological argument (causation and contingency)
Cosmological arguments reason from the existence, change or contingency of the world to the existence of a first cause, necessary being or grounding reality. Aquinas’ first three ways are the classical starting point: the argument from motion (change), the argument from causation, and the argument from contingency and necessity. The core move is that there cannot be an infinite regress of causes or movers that explains why anything exists at all; there must be a first unmoved mover or a necessary being whose existence is not contingent on anything else. Later articulations, such as Leibniz’s Principle of Sufficient Reason, press the demand that there be an explanation for why there is something rather than nothing, concluding that the best explanation is a necessary being — God.

Hume again raised difficulties: he questioned whether the idea of causation we apply within the world can be extended to the universe as a whole, and he warned against illicitly moving from a series of causes to a single distinct cause. The possibility of an infinite regress of events or of a causeless universe is another objection. More recent debate focuses on whether the notion of ‘necessary being’ is coherent, whether contingency truly requires a metaphysical ground, and whether the cosmological move equivocates between different senses of causation. Some defenders use contemporary cosmology to argue for a beginning of the universe (as in the Kalam cosmological argument), claiming that a temporal beginning implies a transcendent cause. Critics respond that even if the universe began, the cause might be impersonal or physical, and that scientific accounts (quantum cosmology, multiverse models) may provide alternative explanations. In exams, show familiarity with key technical terms—contingent, necessary, infinite regress—and explain distinct formulations (Aquinas, Leibniz, Kalam) before evaluating them.

## The ontological argument (conceptual necessity)
The ontological argument is distinctive because it claims a priori that God’s existence follows from the concept of God. Anselm’s original version defines God as “that than which nothing greater can be conceived.” Anselm’s move is to argue that existence in reality is greater than existence merely in the understanding, so if God exists in the understanding, God must also exist in reality. Gaunilo, a contemporary monk, replied with his “lost island” parody: one could define the greatest conceivable island and by the same reasoning prove its existence, which suggests a flaw in the move. Immanuel Kant later offered a powerful critique: existence is not a real predicate that adds to the concept of a thing; it does not function like a property. Therefore the ontological move from definition to existence fails.

In the twentieth century modal reformulations revived the argument. Alvin Plantinga, for example, used modal logic to say that if it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then it exists in some possible world; if it exists in some possible world and maximal greatness entails necessary existence, then it exists in all possible worlds, including the actual world. Critics challenge the coherence of maximal greatness, the legitimacy of the modal premises, and whether possibility of such a being can be established without begging the question. For revision, ensure you can present Anselm’s simple argument, Gaunilo’s and Kant’s objections, and the form and critical responses to modern modal versions; explaining why the ontological argument is a priori helps when comparing it to the teleological and cosmological arguments.

## Comparing the three arguments: strengths and weaknesses
Each argument makes different epistemic claims. The teleological and cosmological arguments are a posteriori, drawing on experience and the order or existence of the universe; they tend to offer probabilistic support and are often pluralistic in what they can imply about the divine (a designer, a prime cause, perhaps limited). The ontological argument is a priori and aims at logical necessity, attempting to show that denial of God is incoherent. Strengths of a posteriori arguments lie in their intuitive appeal to common experience: people commonly infer design or cause and these inferences are familiar. Their weakness is vulnerability to empirical explanations (evolution, cosmology) and to Humean criticisms about analogies and causal extrapolation. The ontological argument’s strength is that it does not depend on contingent facts about the world, so it seems immune to scientific revision; its weakness is that its crucial premises are highly contestable and many philosophers find the a priori step unacceptable.

A useful way to evaluate is to consider what would count as success. A sound philosophical argument should be valid (or at least cogent) and have true premises. For the cosmological and teleological arguments, the premises are empirical and so contestable; for the ontological argument, premises are conceptual and contestable. Students should consider whether combining the arguments creates a cumulative case that is stronger than any single proof, and whether the arguments lead to a theistic God with the attributes of classical theism or merely to some kind of transcendent explanatory reality.

## Common objections and theists’ responses
Many objections recur across the arguments. David Hume’s sceptical points about analogy and cause press that the inferences go beyond what our experience justifies. Darwin’s theory of evolution undercuts biological design claims by offering a naturalistic explanation for complexity. Kant’s critique of existence as a predicate challenges the ontological argument. Other popular objections ask why an all‑powerful, benevolent God would allow evil and disorder, citing the problem of evil as evidence against a designer or perfect first cause. Theists have several responses: design defenders can shift to cosmological or fine‑tuning arguments that are less vulnerable to evolutionary explanation; cosmological advocates may refine their premises (for example, replacing ‘first cause’ with a necessary being that grounds laws and logic); ontological supporters may defend modal premises or reframe the argument in terms of maximal excellence. Some theists accept that philosophical arguments cannot deliver certainty but argue they provide rational warrant for theistic belief when combined with religious experience, moral intuition or revealed religion. When writing about objections, note whether a response preserves the original argument’s core or transforms it into a different kind of claim.

## Exam technique
When answering A‑level questions on these arguments aim first to be precise about definitions and structure. Begin by setting out the argument clearly in your own words: identify whether it is a posteriori or a priori, list the central premises and explain the key technical terms such as ‘necessary being’, ‘contingent’, ‘analogy’, or ‘predicate’. This is the AO1 content that examiners expect. After exposition, move to evaluation: weigh objections, consider the force of criticisms by Hume, Kant and later thinkers, and show awareness of modern scientific and philosophical developments that affect the argument’s plausibility. Use specific examples to illustrate points—for instance, Paley’s watch for teleology, Anselm’s definition for the ontological argument, or the cosmological notion of infinite regress—so your response feels grounded. Integrate scholars’ names and positions to demonstrate breadth of study, but avoid turning answers into a list of quotations; instead explain how each thinker’s critique operates and how defenders have replied.

Balance your essay between explanation and critical assessment, keeping in mind that AO2 carries greater weight. Plan your time so you can provide a concise introduction, two or three well‑developed paragraphs for exposition and similarly for evaluation, and a concluding paragraph that clearly states your reasoned judgement. Where relevant, make comparisons between the arguments—contrast a priori and a posteriori methods, or discuss cumulative approaches—and show how contemporary developments (evolutionary biology, cosmology, modal logic) have altered the debate. Finally, write clearly and refer to the specification’s key concepts; examiners reward structured, well‑argued essays that demonstrate both secure knowledge and thoughtful critical engagement.
