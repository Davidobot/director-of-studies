# Islam: beliefs and practices (GCSE Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: scope and purpose
This revision guide distils the OCR (J625) content for the Islam component into clear, teachable explanations and practical examples to help you prepare for GCSE Religious Studies. It covers the major beliefs and teachings expected in Component Group 1 (Beliefs and teachings & Practices) and the theme-based ethical and philosophical issues from Component Group 2 (Religion, philosophy and ethics in the modern world), approached from a Muslim perspective. Throughout, key Arabic terms are explained, different interpretations are noted where relevant, and links are made between belief and practice so you can answer both AO1 (knowledge and understanding) and AO2 (analysis and evaluation) questions with confidence.

## Core beliefs and sources of authority
At the heart of Sunni belief are the Six Articles of Faith: belief in Allah, angels, holy books, prophets, the Day of Judgment, and predestination. For Shi’a Muslims this core is expressed through the Five Roots of Usul ad-Din: Tawhid (Oneness of God), Adalah (Divine justice), Nubuwwah (Prophethood), Imamah (leadership of the Imams), and Ma’ad (Day of Resurrection). These frameworks shape how Muslims understand the world and their responsibilities. The Qur’an is the central scripture for all Muslims, understood as the final, preserved revelation. The Hadith literature—collections of the Prophet Muhammad’s words and actions—provide practical guidance and explanation, though Sunni and Shi’a traditions place different emphases on particular compilations and on the authority of extra-scriptural sources. In addition to scripture, Muslims draw on the example (Sunnah) of Muhammad and on reason, community practice and consensus when applying teachings to new situations. Being able to explain the differences between Sunni and Shi’a emphases, and to cite examples of how sources are used in practice, is important for higher-level responses.

## The nature of Allah and Tawhid
Tawhid, the absolute oneness of Allah, is the central theological concept. Muslims describe Allah using many attributes—merciful, omnipotent, omniscient, just, transcendent and immanent—often summarised in the ninety-nine names. Tawhid rejects any form of association (shirk) between the Creator and created things; this explains the strong emphasis in Islam on monotheism and on avoiding representations of God. The implications of Tawhid are practical as well as theological: worship is directed to Allah alone, and moral responsibility flows from being accountable to a single, just deity. Different Muslim groups may stress certain attributes more than others—some emphasise God’s mercy and compassion, while others focus on divine justice and sovereignty—but the central commitment to Oneness is shared. When answering exam questions, explain both the meaning of Tawhid and its consequences for daily life, such as how it informs prayer, charity and attitudes to creation.

## Prophethood and scripture
Muslims believe that God communicates to humanity through a line of prophets (nabi or rasul), beginning with Adam and including figures found in the Bible such as Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus), culminating in Muhammad, who is regarded as the final prophet (the Seal of the Prophets). Each prophet brought teaching suited to their people and time; the Qur’an presents Muhammad as both a spiritual model and a practical legislator. Key stories—such as Ibrahim’s willingness to submit to God, Musa receiving the Torah, and Muhammad’s reception of revelation via the angel Jibril (Gabriel)—illustrate themes of obedience, guidance and moral testing. The Qur’an is held to be the preserved and definitive revelation; earlier scriptures are respected as originally revealed but believed to have been altered over time. In evaluation questions you should show awareness of how Muslims justify the authority of the Qur’an and the prophetic model, and consider challenges or alternative views, for example from non-religious perspectives.

## Angels, the afterlife and predestination
Belief in angels (malaikah) is part of orthodox Islam. Angels are viewed as God’s obedient servants who fulfil specific roles: Jibril as conveyor of revelation, Mika’il as provider and sustainer, Israfil as the one who will blow the trumpet on the Day of Judgment, and Izra’il as the angel of death. Muslims understand life as a test that determines the soul’s fate in the afterlife (Akhirah). Concepts of Barzakh (the intermediate state), al-Jannah (heaven) and Jahannam (hell) are central, though interpretations vary from literal to metaphorical. Linked to these beliefs is the theological discussion of predestination (al-Qadr) and human free will. Many Muslims reconcile divine omniscience with human responsibility by distinguishing God’s knowledge from human choice, while schools of thought such as the Muʿtazilites and Ashʿarites offer different emphases on justice and divine will. When you explain eschatological beliefs, clarify how they influence moral conduct—for instance, the idea that deeds are recorded and will be judged motivates ethical behaviour and social responsibility.

## Five Pillars and daily worship practices
The Five Pillars of Islam provide the framework for Muslim life, especially in Sunni practice. The Shahadah (declaration of faith) is the verbal affirmation of belief that begins a Muslim’s religious life. Salat (prayer) is performed five times daily and involves ritual purification (wudu), facing the Kaʿba in Mecca, and set movements and recitations that articulate submission, gratitude and dependence on God. Zakat (obligatory almsgiving) institutionalises economic responsibility to the poor and underpins communal solidarity. Sawm (fasting) during Ramadan disciplines the individual, fosters empathy for the less fortunate and commemorates the revelation of the Qur’an; the Night of Power (Laylat al-Qadr) is particularly significant. Hajj (pilgrimage) is required once in a lifetime for those able to undertake it; its rituals—ihram, tawaf around the Kaʿba, running between Safa and Marwah, standing at Arafat and spending time at Mina—are rich in symbolism and reinforce unity and equality among Muslims. In Shi’a Islam the Five Pillars are complemented by the Ten Obligatory Acts, which reflect different emphases in ritual and communal life. When studying practices, always relate ritual forms to underlying beliefs and show how practice shapes identity.

## Festivals, rites of passage and community life
Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are the two major festivals widely celebrated across the Muslim world. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and is characterised by communal prayer, feasting and charity; Eid al-Adha coincides with Hajj and commemorates Ibrahim’s readiness to sacrifice his son, emphasising submission and generosity. Shi’a communities observe additional commemorations such as Ashura, which mourns the martyrdom of Husayn at Karbala and shapes Shi’a religious memory and identity, while Eid al-Ghadeer marks a particular historical interpretation of succession. Life-cycle rituals—naming, marriage contracts, and funerary practices—situate individuals within family and community, reflecting religious values about family responsibilities, community solidarity and respect for the deceased. The mosque plays multiple roles: a place for worship, education, communal decision-making and social support. In contemporary Britain and elsewhere, Muslim communities adapt rituals to legal and cultural contexts, raising practical and ethical questions about identity, integration and pluralism that are useful to explore in answer development.

## Jihad, ethics and contemporary issues
Jihad is often misunderstood. Within Islamic teaching Jihad primarily denotes the inner struggle to live rightly (the greater jihad), while the lesser jihad can mean defensive military action under strict ethical conditions. Islamic legal and ethical reasoning sets out conditions for legitimate armed action, emphasising proportionality, non-combatant protection and the pursuit of justice. Beyond questions of violence, Islam provides ethical frameworks on issues such as wealth distribution, treatment of the environment, human rights and gender roles. Differences of interpretation—between conservative and reformist voices, between cultural practices and scriptural teachings, and between Sunni and Shi’a understandings—are central to many modern debates. In plural societies Muslims negotiate secular laws, medical ethics (for example on abortion and end-of-life), and religious freedom, which leads to diverse responses across communities. When answering exam questions on modern issues, demonstrate knowledge of Islamic teachings, show how they are applied in different contexts, and evaluate the strengths and limitations of particular positions.

## Diversity within Islam and lived religion
Islam is not monolithic. Historical developments, local cultures and theological schools produce a wide range of beliefs and practices. Sunni Islam, broadly speaking, is shaped by four major legal schools with differing emphases on jurisprudence, while Shi’a Islam places greater authority on the Imams and has distinct rituals, legal practices and festivals. Sufism emphasises mystical experience and devotional practices such as dhikr (remembrance). Cultural contexts—South Asia, the Arab world, Southeast Asia, and Muslim minorities in Europe and North America—have produced varied expressions of Islam, from dress and mosque architecture to gender roles and community organisation. Teachers and candidates benefit from using comparative examples to explain how a single teaching might be understood or practised differently. Demonstrating awareness of intra-faith diversity is crucial for high marks on both AO1 and AO2 questions.

## Exam technique
Exam success in OCR J625 requires clear demonstration of knowledge (AO1) and sustained analysis and evaluation (AO2). For short AO1 questions, be precise: define key terms such as Tawhid, Shahadah or Akhirah and give a brief example or scriptural reference. For medium-length AO1 answers, expand explanations and link belief to practice. For AO2 and extended responses, plan before you write. A strong structure begins with a clear introduction that defines the issue, followed by two or three developed paragraphs that explain religious teachings and how they are applied, using specific references (for example to the Qur’an or Hadith) and showing different viewpoints where appropriate. Always include at least one paragraph that evaluates the issue: identify strengths and weaknesses, consider alternative perspectives (e.g. Sunni vs Shi’a, literal vs metaphorical), and weigh the implications for individuals and society. Conclude with a reasoned judgment that returns to the question. Pay attention to command words: "describe" and "explain" require accurate knowledge and development; "compare" asks you to show similarities and differences; "discuss" expects balanced analysis and a conclusion. Remember that a portion of marks is allocated for Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPaG) and the use of specialist terminology, so use terms correctly and write clearly. Time management is vital: allocate time proportionally to the marks available, leave a few minutes to proofread extended answers, and practise under timed conditions. Finally, when using sources, name them succinctly and show how they support your argument; when offering evaluation, back it with evidence or reasoning rather than assertion. With sound knowledge, careful planning and balanced evaluation, you will be well prepared to achieve the higher grade descriptors.
