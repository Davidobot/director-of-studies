# Relationships and families (religious perspectives) (GCSE Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview of the topic and how it is assessed
The topic of Relationships and families sits within the Component Group 2 themes for OCR GCSE Religious Studies (J625), but it is informed by the beliefs and practices studied in Component Group 1 for each religion. In this theme learners explore what religious traditions teach about the nature and purpose of families, sexual ethics, marriage, gender roles and the moral questions raised by contemporary developments. Assessment requires both accurate knowledge (AO1) — for example of sacred texts, teachings and typical practices — and evaluative skills (AO2), where students analyse how teachings apply in modern Britain and weigh different viewpoints. Good answers combine clear reference to religious teachings or sources of authority with careful analysis of their significance and limitations.

## What religions teach about the purpose of the family
Religions generally present the family as a foundational social unit, but they explain its purpose in different ways. In Christianity the family is often described in terms of covenant, mutual love and responsibility; passages in Genesis and Jesus’ teaching about marriage shape Christian views that marriage unites husband and wife and provides a context for raising children and living out Christian virtues. Islam views the family as central to social stability and moral education, with marriage (nikah) as a legally and morally significant contract and the upbringing of children as a shared duty. Judaism places the family at the heart of religious life through mitzvot observed in the home, and the idea of covenant with Abraham and Sinai underpins responsibilities passed from one generation to the next. Buddhism emphasises ethical relationships and compassion; family life can support moral development, while monastic life presents an alternative that renounces family attachments to pursue enlightenment. Hinduism frames family duties through dharma and the stages of life (ashramas), seeing marriage and household life as a field for practising duty, ritual and the pursuit of spiritual goals. In all traditions cultural practices influence interpretations, so students should be able to describe both the ideal teachings and the way communities actually live them.

## Marriage, cohabitation and sexual ethics
Marriage is treated as a central institution in many religious traditions, but how it is understood varies. Christianity teaches the spiritual and often sacramental significance of marriage, with many denominations emphasising lifelong fidelity and the ideal of sacrificial love modelled by Jesus. Roman Catholic teaching stresses the indissolubility of marriage and the Eucharistic and covenantal symbolism of the marriage rite, while many Protestant churches permit divorce and remarriage in certain circumstances. Islam regards marriage as a contract with rights and duties for both spouses; sexual relations outside marriage are generally prohibited and chastity before marriage is advised, though approaches to gendered expectations and guardianship differ among communities. Judaism similarly sets strong boundaries around sexual conduct, sees marriage as a covenantal partnership with legal dimensions in the ketubah and values fidelity; practices vary between Orthodox, Conservative and Reform communities. Buddhism frames sexual ethics in terms of the Third Precept (avoiding sexual misconduct) and encourages relationships that reduce harm and support compassion; celibacy is required for monastics. Hindu sexual ethics are integrated with dharma, social duty and ideas of purity, and attitudes to premarital sex, cohabitation and contraception differ widely across regions and communities. When answering exam questions, it helps to give specific examples of teachings or ritual words used at a marriage ceremony and to show how different branches within each faith justify their positions.

## Contraception, family planning and modern choices
Religious responses to contraception and family planning illustrate the tension between tradition and modernity. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that artificial contraception frustrates the procreative purpose of marriage and endorses natural family planning instead, while many Protestant denominations accept contraception as responsible stewardship of family resources. In Islam, scholarship has generally permitted contraception if both spouses consent and it does not cause harm, reflecting principles of intention and necessity. Judaism often permits contraception when health or family welfare requires it, though detailed rulings depend on rabbinic interpretation. Buddhism does not have a single dogmatic teaching on contraception; considerations focus on intention, compassion and the avoidance of harm. Hindu views vary: some texts and traditions value procreation as part of dharma while others prioritise household welfare and pragmatic family planning. Teaching this topic well requires explaining the ethical principles each religion uses — such as sanctity of life, stewardship, intention and charity — and applying them to modern scenarios like economic hardship, maternal health or population pressures.

## Divorce, annulment and remarriage
Divorce raises difficult moral questions and different faiths take a range of positions. The Roman Catholic Church does not recognise divorce as ending a valid sacramental marriage; instead it may grant an annulment where a valid marriage bond is judged absent from the start. Other Christian denominations often permit divorce and remarriage, commonly with pastoral sensitivity to reasons such as abuse or infidelity. In Islam, divorce is allowed and regulated; procedures for talaq and the waiting period (iddah) reflect attempts to protect rights and consider reconciliation. Jewish law permits divorce (a get), and dispute over agency and social practice has shaped contemporary debates. Buddhism’s pragmatic ethics tends to emphasise reducing harm and supporting those affected, with recognition that marriage may fail. Hindu responses historically discouraged divorce but modern legal and social realities mean that divorce and remarriage occur, with community attitudes varying widely. When studying these approaches, students should consider both scriptural teaching and social realities, and be prepared to evaluate which responses best protect dignity, justice and welfare.

## Gender roles, equality and changing expectations
Issues of gender, equality and roles within the family are prominent in this theme. Sacred texts and traditional teachings have at times supported differentiated roles for men and women, yet many religious communities reinterpret texts in light of modern values of equality. Christianity contains teaching that has been used to support both traditional complementarity and full equality; passages about mutual submission and passages interpreted as restricting certain roles offer material for debate. Islam upholds principles of dignity for women, the spiritual equality of men and women and distinct legal rights that historically reformed some practices, but cultural patriarchy has influenced applications. Judaism includes egalitarian currents in some movements and more gender-specific roles in others; the synagogue and ritual life provide clear examples of variation. Buddhism’s founding teachings challenge caste and gender hierarchies in some contexts, but institutional practice has at times restricted full ordination for women, a situation that is changing in many schools. Hinduism offers a wide spectrum from devotion to female deities and recognition of female spiritual authority to social structures that have enforced gender hierarchies; modern reform movements emphasise equality and human rights. In the exam, a strong answer recognises the diversity within each religion, explains theological arguments used on both sides, and assesses how well religious practice in Britain today aligns with contemporary equality laws and social expectations.

## Same-sex relationships and secular law
Same-sex relationships provide a clear example of where religious teachings and secular law can diverge. Different religious communities have responded in varied ways: some denominations and groups accept same-sex marriage or bless same-sex unions and emphasise pastoral inclusion and justice; others maintain traditional teachings that sexual relations should be between a man and a woman. In Islam and Orthodox Judaism traditional legal positions tend to oppose same-sex sexual activity, while other Muslim and Jewish thinkers and communities engage in re-interpretation and inclusive pastoral practice. In Hindu and Buddhist contexts there is no single universal prohibition and local attitudes are shaped by culture and modern legal frameworks. In Britain, the legal recognition of same-sex marriage and protections against discrimination mean that religious and non-religious groups must navigate tensions between freedom of religion, freedom from discrimination and the rights of LGBT+ people. For exams, candidates should be able to explain how religious teachings are applied in practice, weigh competing moral claims, and articulate thoughtful evaluations about whether and how faith communities should respond to legal change.

## Applying the theme in the classroom and in wider society
When teaching Relationships and families it is important to move beyond memorising texts to exploring how teachings shape lived experience. Use case studies, real-life scenarios and comparative questions to show how abstract principles (such as sanctity of life, duty, compassion or stewardship) lead to practical choices in family planning, marriage counselling, or social policy. Encourage learners to recognise internal diversity in each tradition by contrasting orthodox, reform and liberal positions; this will help them answer AO1 questions with nuance and AO2 questions with balanced evaluation. Discuss how British law, modern medicine and changing social attitudes present fresh dilemmas for religious ethics, and use classroom debates or role-plays to develop empathy and evaluative skills. When referencing sources of authority, teach students to name the text or teaching (for example, Genesis, Qur’anic passages, Mishnah/Talmud, the Dhammapada, the Bhagavad Gita) and to explain how different communities interpret that material. This practice strengthens answers and shows examiners the candidate’s ability to link belief to practice.

## Exam technique
To score well in examinations on Relationships and families you need to organise knowledge and analysis clearly. For AO1 answers, present accurate definitions and explain teachings with reference to specific sources of wisdom and authority; avoid vague generalities. For AO2 you must analyse significance and evaluate viewpoints: show understanding of strengths and weaknesses, consider alternative perspectives within the religion, and apply teachings to contemporary situations. When a question uses command words such as “describe”, “explain”, “compare” or “discuss”, respond to the task precisely: describe and explain focus on evidence and meaning, compare asks for similarities and differences, and discuss requires balanced argument and judgment. For extended questions plan a short structure before writing: a clear introduction that sets out what you will do, two or three developed paragraphs that use evidence and argue different sides, and a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Allocate time to the question’s marks; practise writing a 15-mark balanced discussion that includes accurate use of specialist terminology and ends with a justified conclusion. Remember that Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPaG) are credited on designated extended responses, so write clearly, use paragraphs and include key terms correctly. Where relevant, bring in social or legal context in Britain, show awareness of diversity within a faith tradition, and avoid presenting a single view as definitive. Exemplify answers with brief, relevant references to sacred texts or to real-life examples, and always relate those examples back to the question asked. Regular timed practice using past-paper style questions will build the confidence and clarity examiners look for.
