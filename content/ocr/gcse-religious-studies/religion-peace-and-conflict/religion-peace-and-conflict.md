# Religion, peace and conflict (GCSE Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview of the theme
Religion, peace and conflict asks how religious beliefs, teachings and practices influence attitudes to violence, war and peacemaking. It brings together ethical theory, sacred sources and real-life situations so that learners can explain and evaluate how religious traditions respond to violence and how believers try to build peace. In this topic you should be able to describe different kinds of conflict (personal, communal, national and international), explain religious teachings about violence and peace, analyse how those teachings are applied in the modern world, and evaluate moral arguments about whether violence can ever be justified. The aim is not only to learn what religious traditions say but also to think critically about tensions and choices: for example, when is it right to resist injustice, how should communities respond to terrorism, and what does a just peace look like?

## Religious teachings on violence and the problem of evil
Most religions recognise the reality of suffering and wrongdoing and offer explanations for its existence as well as moral guidance on how to respond. Within Christianity the problem of evil has been discussed alongside beliefs about God’s goodness, human free will and the need for compassion. The teaching of Jesus to love enemies and turn the other cheek sits alongside Old Testament texts where God’s people are called to defend justice. In Islam Allah’s justice and mercy are central, and teachings emphasise moral responsibility, the testing nature of life and accountability on the Day of Judgement. Judaism, with strong themes of covenant and law, includes commandments that protect life while acknowledging the need to resist oppression. Buddhism interprets suffering in terms of craving, ignorance and harmful actions and focuses on the alleviation of suffering by ethical living and wisdom. Hinduism locates suffering within karma and samsara and offers duty (dharma) and different paths (yogas) as ways of responding. Across traditions, the presence of evil raises questions about divine power and goodness, but religions also provide practical instructions about how individuals and communities should behave when confronted with violence.

## Just War, holy war and religious rules about fighting
Religious traditions have developed ideas to limit and justify violence. The classical Just War tradition in Christianity sets conditions for when war can be morally permitted: a just cause, legitimate authority, right intention, probability of success, proportionality and last resort. These criteria aim to restrain the resort to violence and to protect non-combatants. In Islam the concept of jihad is often misunderstood; within mainstream teaching greater jihad refers to the inner struggle to live rightly, while lesser jihad can include defensive warfare subject to strict rules about conduct, protection of civilians and proportionality. Judaism has concepts that permit defensive wars and also distinguishes between wars commanded by God in ancient texts and discretionary wars; rabbis have discussed conditions that justify fighting. Hinduism introduces ideas of righteous action and duty, including the notion of dharma-yuddha (righteous warfare) in texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, while Buddhist teachings generally discourage violence because of the precept against taking life, though historical examples complicate a simple pacifist reading. When studying these concepts, it helps to separate sacred ideals from historical practice: religious language has been used both to restrain violence and, at times, to inspire or legitimise it.

## Pacifism, non-violence and peacemaking
Many religious communities advocate pacifism or non-violent resistance as the most faithful response to injustice. Absolute pacifists reject all forms of violence on moral grounds, often appealing to the sanctity of life and teachings about love and compassion. Conditional pacifists may accept self-defence but oppose war as a means of resolving disputes. Christianity has strong pacifist strands, particularly among groups like the Quakers, who emphasise reconciliation and restorative justice. Buddhism’s emphasis on ahimsa (non-harm) and compassion supports non-violent responses, and Jain and some Hindu streams similarly prioritise harmlessness. Modern figures such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. provide influential religious models of non-violent resistance: their campaigns show how moral force, civil disobedience and disciplined non-violence can address structural injustice while seeking to avoid dehumanising the opponent. Peacemaking in religious contexts often involves practical work: mediation, humanitarian aid, community reconciliation programmes and interfaith dialogue that build relationships and address root causes of conflict.

## Terrorism, extremism and religious responses
Terrorism presents particular challenges because it aims to create fear by targeting civilians and uses violence for political ends. Religions overwhelmingly condemn the deliberate killing of innocents, and most mainstream religious leaders reject terrorism. Nevertheless, a small minority have used religious language to justify extreme acts, often by reading texts out of context, adopting exclusivist ideologies or combining political grievances with distorted theology. Teaching this topic requires careful differentiation between the peaceful majority and extremist actors. It is useful to explore how religious communities respond after attacks: many issue condemnations, support victims, engage in de-radicalisation work and participate in public debates about integration and social justice. Understanding terrorism also involves examining causes beyond theology, including political oppression, social exclusion, radicalisation pathways and international factors. Students should be able to explain why religious justifications for terrorism are widely rejected and evaluate proposals for prevention, including education, community engagement and policing.

## Forgiveness, reconciliation and restorative justice
Religious traditions place strong emphasis on forgiveness and reconciliation as essential to healing after wrongdoing. Christianity highlights forgiveness as central to discipleship, encouraging believers to forgive as they have been forgiven, while Judaism stresses repentance (teshuva), ethical repair and the ongoing work of communal justice. Islam values repentance and mercy and teaches that forgiveness can lead to spiritual restoration. Buddhism speaks of letting go of hatred through compassion and mindfulness, and Hindu traditions include rituals and values aimed at restoring balance after harm. In practice, forgiveness does not always mean forgetting or excusing; many faith-based peacebuilders combine forgiveness with demands for justice, truth-telling and material reparation. Truth commissions and reconciliation processes, such as those that followed apartheid in South Africa, demonstrate how religious language and institutions can support both acknowledgment of harm and constructive pathways to communal repair. For students it is important to weigh the moral aims of forgiveness against practical needs for accountability and the prevention of future harm.

## Religion’s role in modern conflicts and peacebuilding
Religious actors and institutions can be both sources of conflict and powerful agents of peace. In some contexts religious identity has been mobilised for political ends, contributing to sectarian violence or exclusivist nationalism. Yet religious leaders and organisations also contribute to humanitarian relief, trauma counselling, intercommunal dialogue and negotiations. Religious networks can cross borders and sustain long-term relationships that secular institutions sometimes lack. Contemporary case studies are valuable for understanding complexity: examples include the work of faith-based NGOs providing aid in war zones, interfaith peace committees in divided societies, clergy mediators in ceasefire negotiations, and religious figures who oppose violent extremism. In Britain and Europe, faith communities have been involved in community cohesion initiatives, counter-extremism dialogues and support for refugees. When assessing religion’s role, students should consider evidence of both harm and good, and reflect on why religious capital can be mobilised for different ends.

## Contemporary ethical dilemmas: nuclear weapons, drones and humanitarian intervention
Modern technology and international politics raise new moral questions about warfare. Nuclear weapons present a stark dilemma: their destructive capacity makes any use catastrophic, prompting many religious voices to call for disarmament while others argue deterrence can prevent greater evils. Drone strikes and targeted killings raise concerns about civilian casualties, remote warfare, accountability and the psychological distance between decision-makers and the battlefield. Humanitarian intervention—using force to stop atrocities—poses another moral test: some argue it is a duty to prevent genocide, while others warn of neo-colonialism, unintended harm and the legality of intervention. Religious ethics offers resources for evaluating these dilemmas: principles such as the sanctity of life, protection of the vulnerable, stewardship and just cause feed into arguments for restraint, humanitarian responsibility and rigorous assessment of consequences. Students should be able to apply religious principles to modern scenarios and assess competing moral claims, recognising that reasonable, faithful people may disagree.

## Exam technique
To succeed in exam questions on religion, peace and conflict you must combine accurate knowledge (AO1) with clear analysis and evaluation (AO2). Start by reading the question carefully, underlining command words such as “explain”, “assess”, “compare” or “discuss.” For AO1 responses, focus on precise definitions and clear explanations of beliefs, teachings and practices, and support these with named religious ideas or authoritative examples—for instance, the Sermon on the Mount for Christian pacifism, the principle of lesser jihad in Islam for rules of warfare, or the Five Precepts and ahimsa in Buddhism and Hinduism. For AO2 responses, move beyond description: weigh strengths and weaknesses, consider alternative viewpoints, and apply ethical principles to the scenario given. A useful paragraph structure is to make a clear point, support it with religious evidence or an example, explain its significance, and then evaluate by offering an opposing view or implication.

Timing matters. In the two-hour Component Group 2 paper you answer four questions, each with parts that test both AO1 and AO2. Allocate your time so that the longer, higher-mark evaluative questions get proportionately more time. Plan short outlines before writing extended answers to keep your argument focused. Use key terms accurately (for example, “just war”, “proportionality”, “pacifism”, “reconciliation”), and aim to include at least two religious perspectives when asked to “discuss” or “compare”. For SPaG marks, write clearly, use correct spelling and punctuation, and include specialist vocabulary where appropriate. Conclude essays with a short judgement that summarises your evaluation and gives a reasoned final position—this shows the examiner you can reach a considered conclusion.

Practise with past-style questions and mark schemes that emphasise the difference between AO1 and AO2 responses. When revising, make synoptic links between beliefs and practices so you can show how teachings influence real decisions: for example, link a doctrine about the sanctity of life to contemporary debates about nuclear deterrence or medical ethics after conflict. Finally, use examples and brief case studies to illustrate your points; examiners reward answers that balance knowledge, analysis and real-world application.
