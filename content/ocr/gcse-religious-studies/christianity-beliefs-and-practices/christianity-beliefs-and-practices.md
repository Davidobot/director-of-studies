# Christianity: beliefs and practices (GCSE Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what Christians believe and why it matters
Christianity is a diverse faith centred on the life, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and on belief in one God. At GCSE level it helps to think in terms of three linked areas: core beliefs about God and the nature of reality; what Christians believe about Jesus, salvation and life after death; and the practices that flow from these beliefs. Beliefs and practices are not separate: doctrine shapes worship, moral choices and community life, and practices such as prayer, baptism and the Eucharist express and reinforce doctrine. Different Christian traditions—Roman Catholic, Orthodox and a wide range of Protestant churches—agree on many basics but often emphasise different aspects, so exam answers should show both shared beliefs and the diversity of interpretation.

## The nature of God and the Trinity
Christians are monotheists who speak of one God with a complex personal nature. Key attributes commonly emphasised are omnipotence (all-powerful), omniscience (all-knowing), benevolence (all‑good), transcendence (beyond the world) and immanence (present and active in the world). The doctrine of the Trinity remains central and distinctive: God is understood as one being expressed in three persons—Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This is not three gods but one God in a threefold relationship. The Father is often spoken of as the source and creator, the Son as the Word who became human in Jesus, and the Holy Spirit as God’s presence active in believers and the church. Different denominations handle the mystery of the Trinity in varied ways, but all use it to explain how Christians can speak of both God’s greatness and God’s closeness.

## Jesus, salvation and eschatology
Jesus occupies the heart of Christian belief. He is described with titles such as Messiah, Son of God, Lord and Saviour. Christians understand Jesus’ life and teaching as a model for moral living and his death and resurrection as decisive for salvation. Theories of atonement offer different ways to think about how Jesus saves: some emphasise sacrifice and the payment for sin, others stress Christ’s victory over evil, and others see the crucifixion as the supreme demonstration that transforms human hearts. The incarnation—God becoming human in Jesus—shows God’s willingness to enter human suffering; the resurrection affirms victory over death and is the basis for Christian hope in life after death. Christian eschatology deals with ideas about resurrection, judgement, heaven and hell and includes a belief in Christ’s return. Within Christianity there are varying emphases: some expect a literal bodily resurrection and final judgement, others focus on spiritual continuity or symbolic readings, and Roman Catholic teaching adds doctrines such as purgatory that are not accepted by all.

## Worship, sacraments and prayer
Worship in Christianity takes many forms but has common patterns: communal services, individual devotion and rites that mark life’s stages. Liturgical churches use structured services with set prayers, readings and sacraments; charismatic churches favour spontaneous prayer, contemporary music and an emphasis on the Holy Spirit. Two practices are of particular doctrinal importance. Baptism is the rite of initiation: some denominations practise infant baptism as entry into the covenant community, others practise believer’s baptism for those who can express faith. The Eucharist (Holy Communion, Mass) is practiced by nearly all Christians but understood differently: Roman Catholics teach transubstantiation (the bread and wine become Christ’s body and blood), Orthodox Christians hold a sacramental realism, and many Protestants interpret the meal as a memorial or a spiritual presence. Prayer ranges from the set prayers of liturgy to personal petitions and contemplative silence. The Lord’s Prayer is a key model used in public and private worship. Festivals such as Christmas and Easter mark the incarnation and resurrection and remain central to Christian worship and identity.

## The church, community life and mission
The church is both institution and community: it provides pastoral care, education, rites of passage and social action. Churches run Sunday schools, youth groups, food banks and support for the vulnerable, expressing beliefs in love, justice and service. Rites of passage—baptism, confirmation, marriage and funeral rites—mark personal and communal identity. Christian mission and evangelism remain important: the Great Commission to ‘make disciples’ underlies missionary activity, while modern mission often combines proclamation with social action such as development projects and advocacy. Ecumenical movements work to bridge divides between denominations, and many churches belong to local or international networks that coordinate charity and peacemaking. Christians also respond to persecution and support persecuted believers, which is a practical expression of solidarity rooted in theology.

## Christian ethics: families, gender, peace and justice
Christian moral teaching addresses family life, gender roles, sexual ethics and wider social issues. Traditional teaching emphasises marriage as the normative context for sexual relationships and the family as a key unit for upbringing and moral formation, but practice varies: some churches now recognise same-sex marriage and civil partnerships while others maintain historic teachings. Discussions about contraception, divorce and remarriage show how Christians apply scripture, tradition and reason differently. On peace and conflict Christians draw resources from Jesus’ teachings on love and forgiveness as well as from theological traditions that justify resistance or the use of force. Many Christians embrace pacifism, including historic groups like Quakers, while others accept just war principles or see armed intervention as sometimes necessary to prevent greater evils. The Christian commitment to justice motivates work against poverty and inequality, support for refugees and campaigning on ethical issues such as medical ethics and human rights. Forgiveness and reconciliation are taught as central moral goods, and practical examples—such as truth and reconciliation processes—show how Christian principles can shape public life.

## Applying beliefs to modern issues and diversity within Christianity
When approaching contemporary ethical questions, Christians draw on scripture, tradition, reason and experience. Differences between denominations often come from varying interpretations of scripture and weight given to tradition or reason. For example, how Genesis is read affects views on creation and science: some Christians read the early chapters literally and others see them as symbolic or theological accounts compatible with scientific explanations. Similarly, contemporary debates about gender equality, secular law and religious freedom require Christians to balance loyalty to tradition with pastoral sensitivity and respect for plural society. Understanding the range of Christian responses—conservative, liberal, progressive—helps when explaining how beliefs influence behaviour and social policy. In Britain, Christianity has shaped public life and institutions, but it now interacts with a plural and often secular public sphere; knowing how Christians engage in dialogue with non-religious positions is useful for classroom discussion and exam answers.

## Exam technique
Answering questions successfully requires clear knowledge (AO1) and the ability to analyse and evaluate (AO2). Short recall questions need concise, accurate statements of belief or practice. For explanation questions aim to connect belief to consequence: give a clear definition, expand with explanation and finish with an example or denominational difference. For 6–8 mark questions develop a focused point with a reason and a supporting example, and if asked to compare always explain similarities and differences between denominations. For 12–15 mark evaluative essays open with a brief introduction that sets out the issue and your approach. Develop two or three well-structured paragraphs that present reasons and evidence, including biblical teachings, church teaching or real-world examples, then include a considered counter-argument and finish with a reasoned conclusion that weighs the evidence. Use key theological vocabulary correctly and keep it relevant to the question; SPaG will be assessed in extended responses so write clearly and check grammar. Time management is essential: in a one-hour component divide time between questions so longer answers get the depth they require; in a two-hour paper plan roughly the same per theme but allow extra time for evaluation and checking. When evaluating, avoid unsupported assertion: back up claims with scripture, doctrinal teaching or practical examples and explain why certain views are stronger. Always show awareness of diversity within Christianity by referring to different denominations where relevant, and link beliefs to practices to demonstrate synoptic understanding.
