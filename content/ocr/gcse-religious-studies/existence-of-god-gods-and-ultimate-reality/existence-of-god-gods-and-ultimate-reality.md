# Existence of God, gods and ultimate reality (GCSE Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Key terms and approaches to ultimate reality
When you study questions about the existence of God, gods or ultimate reality it helps to begin with clear definitions. Monotheism is the belief in one personal, loving and often intervening God, as in Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Polytheism understands divinity as many gods with different functions, common in some Hindu traditions and in earlier religions. Pantheism identifies God with the universe itself, while panentheism holds that the divine pervades the world but also transcends it. Some traditions, notably many forms of Buddhism and some strands of Hindu thought, speak of ultimate reality in impersonal terms: concepts such as nibbāna or Brahman describe a state or principle beyond ordinary existence rather than a personal deity. Related pairs of terms you will meet in questions are transcendent (beyond and independent of the world) and immanent (present within the world), and personal (a God who can relate to persons) versus impersonal (ultimate reality as a state or principle). Being able to explain these distinctions, and give religious examples, is essential for AO1 answers and provides the vocabulary to analyse and evaluate in AO2 responses.

## Classical arguments for the existence of God
Philosophical arguments have aimed to show that belief in God is rational. The cosmological argument argues from the existence of the universe to a necessary first cause or uncaused cause. It invites candidates to present the idea that everything contingent needs an explanation, and so the chain of causes must terminate in a necessary being. The teleological or design argument uses apparent order, complexity or fine-tuning in nature as evidence for an intelligent designer. Classic versions used analogy — for example, comparing a watch to the world — and modern forms appeal to the fine-tuning of physical constants. The moral argument suggests that objective moral values are best explained by a moral lawgiver. Each of these arguments has strengths that examiners expect you to explain: they can provide intuitive reasons for belief and connect to human experience, scientific order and moral intuition. For higher marks you should show knowledge of classic supporters, for example medieval thinkers who developed cosmological reasoning, and of contemporary refinements that try to respond to scientific challenges.

## Objections, the problem of evil and responses
The problem of evil is the single most important challenge in this topic. It asks how an all-powerful, all-knowing and all-loving God can allow moral evil (wrongdoing by people) and natural evil (earthquakes, disease). The logical form of the problem argues that these attributes of God are inconsistent with pervasive evil. The evidential form claims the scale and kinds of suffering make belief unlikely. Philosophical responses include the free will defence, which argues that meaningful moral freedom explains moral evil and that some goods—such as genuine love—depend on freedom; the soul‑making or Irenaean response, which regards suffering as part of moral and spiritual development; and skeptical theism, which claims human beings are not in a position to judge God’s reasons. Critics respond that these replies can be unsatisfying when facing horrendous, apparently pointless suffering, or that appeals to unknown reasons make religious belief unfalsifiable. Other objections come from naturalistic explanations, which attribute moral systems or the appearance of order to evolution, social conditioning and psychological processes rather than to a deity. In exams you should balance explanation of the problem with careful evaluation of the main responses, showing awareness of different types of evil and their ethical implications.

## Religious experience, revelation and miracles as evidence
Many believers appeal to religious experience, revelation and reported miracles as direct evidence of the divine. Religious experience can take the form of conversion, mystical union, visions or a sense of awe and wonder; these experiences may transform lives and motivate moral change. Revelation is presented in different ways across religions: some traditions regard scripture as direct divine communication, others see inspiration or ongoing revelation through prophetic figures. Miracles are events that appear to defy ordinary explanation and are sometimes claimed as signs of divine action. Philosophers and critics challenge how to verify such claims. Some argue that religious experiences are culturally shaped, psychologically explainable, or susceptible to hallucination and wishful thinking. Others maintain that personal transformation and corroborative testimony strengthen their credibility. When analysing this material, show how different religious traditions understand revelation and give examples of religious experiences and miracles. Evaluate whether personal, subjective testimony can count as objective evidence and consider methodological standards for assessing extraordinary claims.

## Ultimate reality beyond theism: Hindu and Buddhist perspectives
Not all religious answers to the question of ultimate reality centre on a creator God. In Hindu thought ultimate reality is often expressed as Brahman, the eternal, infinite ground of being. Some Hindu traditions describe Brahman as personal (saguna) and manifest in deities such as Vishnu or Shiva, whereas others emphasise an impersonal, formless absolute (nirguna). The concept of ātman, the eternal self, and its relation to Brahman is central to many Hindu teachings; liberation (moksha) is freedom from the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra). Buddhism approaches ultimate reality differently. The Buddha taught the Dhamma, which includes the Four Noble Truths and the insight that existence is characterised by suffering, impermanence and non-self (anattā). Nibbāna is the goal: the extinguishing of craving and the end of rebirth. Here ultimate reality is not a creator God but a state beyond desire and suffering. Presenting these views accurately lets you contrast theistic with non‑theistic understandings and explore how different concepts of ultimate reality shape ethics, worship and life aims.

## Life after death, salvation and liberation
Questions about existence of God often connect to beliefs about what happens after death. In Abrahamic religions, ideas of resurrection, judgment and an afterlife in heaven or hell are commonly taught, sometimes with qualifications such as purgatory or differing understandings of reward and punishment. In Hinduism and Buddhism, afterlife is framed through rebirth and karma: actions have moral consequences that affect future lives, and liberation ends the cycle of rebirth. These doctrines influence ethical decision-making: if actions have eternal consequences, that affects how believers treat others and the environment. In answers you should explain doctrinal differences and discuss how beliefs about the afterlife serve religious purposes — comforting the bereaved, motivating moral behaviour, or providing a teleology to existence — and then evaluate whether life after death is plausible or necessary for meaningful ethics.

## Non‑religious and pluralist perspectives
In contemporary Britain and beyond, secular and non‑religious worldviews play a major role in debates about ultimate reality. Atheism denies the existence of God or gods, often appealing to naturalistic explanations and arguing that empirical evidence does not support theistic claims. Agnosticism suspends judgment, holding that knowledge of God may be unknowable. Humanism argues for ethical living grounded in human flourishing without recourse to the divine. Pluralist approaches to religious diversity raise questions about truth claims: exclusivism maintains one religion is uniquely true, inclusivism allows that truth may be found in other traditions, and pluralism suggests multiple valid paths to ultimate reality. When evaluating arguments for or against God, the examiner expects you to explain how non‑religious perspectives account for morality, meaning and human experience, and to show whether these accounts compete with, complement or challenge religious explanations.

## Exam technique
To gain high marks, plan answers that show clear AO1 knowledge and developed AO2 evaluation. Begin short answers by defining key terms and giving a concise example or quotation from a religious source where relevant. For longer responses, open with a brief outline of the issue and the approach you will take. Structure essays into clear paragraphs: one paragraph to explain a belief or argument, one to develop supporting reasons and examples (scriptural references, religious practices or named philosophical arguments), and one to offer critical evaluation. Evaluation should engage with strengths, weaknesses and alternative views: if you present the design argument, follow it with philosophical objections and consider scientific challenges, then give a reasoned judgement. Use the command words carefully: “describe” and “explain” require clear factual AO1 content; “analyse”, “assess” and “discuss” require balanced AO2 reasoning. Remember SPaG: in the two‑hour paper there are six marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar across extended answers and three marks in belief-and-practice papers. To secure these marks, write in full sentences, use specialist vocabulary accurately, and check tense and punctuation when you have time. Time management is crucial: allow proportional minutes for each question, spend a little time planning longer answers, and leave a minute at the end to read and correct obvious errors. Finally, support evaluative conclusions with evidence and avoid unsupported claims; examiners reward clear, well‑reasoned answers that show both knowledge of religious material and thoughtful engagement with the philosophical and ethical issues it raises.
