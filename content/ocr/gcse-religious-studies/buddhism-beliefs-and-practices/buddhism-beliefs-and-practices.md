# Buddhism: beliefs and practices (GCSE Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview and key concepts
Buddhism is a non-theistic religion and philosophical tradition that began in northern India with the life and teaching of Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha. Rather than centring belief in a creator god, Buddhism focuses on understanding suffering (dukkha), its causes, and the path to its ending. The Three Jewels — the Buddha (the enlightened teacher), the Dhamma (the teaching), and the Sangha (the community) — form the heart of Buddhist identity and practice. Students should be comfortable with key vocabulary and variant spellings you will meet in exam questions: for example, nibbana (Pali) / nirvana (Sanskrit), anatta (Pali) / anatman (Sanskrit), and the different names for texts and suttas. Across traditions there are shared core ideas (the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, kamma and rebirth, the Three Marks of Existence), but the ways they are interpreted and practised vary between Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism; exam answers gain strength by explaining these similarities and differences.

## The life of the Buddha and Enlightenment
The story of the Buddha’s life explains why he is central to Buddhism and illustrates the path to awakening. Born as Siddhartha Gautama into a royal household, he encountered the “Four Sights” (old age, sickness, death and a wandering ascetic) which prompted him to leave palace life in search of a solution to suffering. After years of study and ascetic practice he realised the Middle Way, defeated the forces personified as Mara, and attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya. Enlightenment, or nibbana, is the end of craving and the ending of rebirth. Different traditions emphasise aspects of his life and authority: Theravada tends to stress the historical Buddha and his awakening as a paradigm for arhants, while Mahayana highlights the ongoing example of bodhisattvas and the idea of buddha-nature present in all beings. When answering exam questions about the Buddha, refer to episodes such as the Bodhi experience and the first turning of the Wheel of Dhamma (the Dhammacakkappavattana sutta) to show understanding of source material.

## The Dhamma, the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination
The Dhamma is central: it names the Buddha’s teachings and the ultimate law of reality. The Four Noble Truths present a diagnostic and prescriptive framework: (1) life involves dukkha (suffering), (2) suffering has a cause (tanha/craving linked to the three poisons of attachment, aversion and ignorance), (3) there is an end to suffering (nibbana), and (4) that end is reached by following the Eightfold Path. Dependent origination (paṭicca-samuppāda) explains how ignorance conditions a twelve-link chain that perpetuates the cycle of rebirth (samsara): each link gives rise to the next, showing that nothing arises independently. The Three Marks of Existence — anicca (impermanence), dukkha (unsatisfactoriness) and anatta (no permanent self) — are used to analyse experience and support the path to liberation. In essays, link these doctrinal ideas to practical consequences: for instance, how anatta challenges attachment to a permanent identity and how dependent origination underpins the ethical urgency to act skilfully.

## Ethics, kamma and human personality
Ethical teaching in Buddhism is practical and teleological: actions (kamma/karma) have ethical consequences that affect rebirth and present wellbeing. The Five Precepts (abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech and intoxication) function as basic ethical guidelines for lay followers, while monastic codes (Vinaya) regulate the lives of monks and nuns. Compassion (karuṇā) and loving-kindness (mettā) are central virtues, and Mahayana traditions develop these into the bodhisattva ideal — postponing final enlightenment to help all beings. The Theravada analysis of the human person uses the five aggregates (khandhas) to show that what we call a ‘person’ is a constantly changing aggregation with no unchanging self. Mahayana introduces concepts such as sunyata (emptiness) and tathāgatagarbha (buddha‑nature), offering different philosophical emphases. When answering questions on ethics and personhood, explain how kamma connects actions, intention (cetana) and future consequences, and use examples such as the practice of dana (generosity) or metta meditation to show ethical application.

## Practices: meditation, worship and the Sangha
Practice is how Buddhism’s teachings are lived. Meditation is central and takes many forms. Samatha (calming) practices cultivate concentration; vipassana (insight) cultivates clear seeing into impermanence and non-self. Loving-kindness (mettā) meditation develops compassion, while Zen (Chan) schools emphasise zazen and sudden insight experiences (kenshō, satori). In many cultures devotional practices such as puja, chanting of sutras or mantras, the use of malas (prayer beads) and offerings at shrines support moral cultivation and concentration. The Sangha includes monastic communities (with their ordination rules and precepts) and lay communities; the monastic Sangha preserves teachings and provides a model of disciplined practice, while lay Buddhists support monasteries and practise in daily life. There are also modern expressions such as secular mindfulness and insight meditation groups that apply Buddhist techniques in non-religious contexts. In answers, show how practices relate to beliefs: for instance, how meditation aims to reduce tanha and lead toward nibbana, or how chanting and puja strengthen devotion and ethical resolve.

## Sacred places, pilgrimage and festivals
Certain places and events in the Buddha’s life have become sacred: Bodh Gaya (site of awakening), the Deer Park at Sarnath (first sermon), and Kushinagar (parinirvana) attract pilgrimage and form a geography of devotion. Temples, viharas and gompas are centres for ritual, teaching and retreat. Festivals mark events in the Buddha’s life and the Buddhist calendar: Wesak commemorates the Buddha’s birth, enlightenment and passing away; Vassa is the rainy season retreat observed with intensified practice; Uposatha days are regular observance days for heightened ethical training. Local cultures shape how these festivals are celebrated, so practices vary across Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tibet, Japan and the West. In exam responses, you can illustrate the importance of pilgrimage and festivals by explaining their roles in communal identity, moral formation and the reinforcement of doctrinal memory.

## Attitudes to death and mourning
Buddhist attitudes to death are shaped by teachings on impermanence, kamma and rebirth. Death is a transition in the continuing process of becoming; ethical quality of life affects future states. Funeral customs vary: Theravada communities often practise cremation and memorial rituals, while Tibetan Buddhism has elaborate rites informed by the Bardo teachings found in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which guide the consciousness through intermediate states. Japanese Obon commemorates ancestral spirits and involves community gatherings and rituals. Rituals help families cope, provide merit for the deceased, and frame death within a soteriological narrative. In exam answers, explain how beliefs about rebirth and kamma shape mourning practices, and consider both religious and cultural influences on funeral customs.

## Buddhism in the modern world
Modernity has brought new contexts and challenges for Buddhism. Secular mindfulness programmes use meditation techniques stripped of religious language for psychological wellbeing. Engaged Buddhism applies ethical teachings to social and environmental issues, illustrated by figures such as Thich Nhat Hanh and community projects that combine compassion with activism. Global spread has produced adaptations to Western culture, debates about ordination (including women’s ordination) and revived interest in Buddhist scholarship. When considering contemporary issues, show awareness of diversity within Buddhism and balance descriptions of traditional doctrine with examples of modern reinterpretation.

## Exam technique
To succeed in the OCR Component on Beliefs and Practices, know the structure and assessment focus: the paper is one hour, targets AO1 (knowledge and understanding) and AO2 (analysis and evaluation) with a heavier weighting to AO1 in Component Group 1. Short questions require precise factual recall — use key terms and brief quotations or sutta references where appropriate (for example naming the Dhammacakkappavattana sutta or the Dhammapada lines). For longer questions, plan a clear paragraph structure: define terms, explain teachings, link beliefs to practice, and where asked, compare different Buddhist perspectives (Theravada vs Mahayana vs Vajrayana). For “Discuss” or evaluation tasks, present balanced arguments: state a claim, support it with doctrinal evidence and practical examples, consider counter-arguments or alternative interpretations, and reach a reasoned conclusion. Use the Three Marks, the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path as organizing ideas for many answers, and always relate doctrine to lived practice (meditation, ethics, festivals, Sangha). Time management is essential: allocate time according to marks — short 3–6 mark questions need concise answers, while the 9–15 mark extended responses need structured paragraphs and evaluation. Aim to include at least two views or traditions when the question invites comparison, and remember the SPaG marks in extended answers: write clearly, use specialist terminology accurately, and check spelling and sentence structure. Practise past questions, time yourself, and learn a few key sutta or scripture references and vivid examples (Bodh Gaya, the Tibetan Bardo, types of meditation) so you can demonstrate both knowledge and understanding under exam conditions.
