# Judaism: beliefs and practices (GCSE Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview of Judaism and how to study it
Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion whose beliefs and practices are rooted in the covenantal relationship between G‑d and the Jewish people. For GCSE study you need to understand both core doctrines and the ways these are lived out: beliefs about the nature of G‑d, the meaning of the covenant and mitzvot (commandments), ideas about the afterlife and the Messiah, and the rich pattern of worship, festivals and life‑cycle rituals. You should learn key Jewish terms and texts (the Torah, the rest of the Tenakh, and the Talmud and rabbinic literature) and be able to show how beliefs shape individual behaviour and community life. Bear in mind that Judaism is not uniform: Orthodox, Conservative (Masorti), Reform and other movements interpret texts and obligations differently, and contemporary issues (for example about Israel, gender roles or medical ethics) highlight these variations. When you answer exam questions, show specific knowledge, refer to appropriate sources of wisdom, and explain differences of view where they exist.

## Beliefs about G‑d and the Divine presence
Central to Judaism is belief in one G‑d who is creator, judge, law‑giver and eternal. The Shema — “Hear, O Israel: the Lord our G‑d, the Lord is One” — expresses monotheism and underpins Jewish identity. Jewish language often treats the divine name with special care; this is why you may see “G‑d” used to show reverence for the divine name. Jewish theology balances ideas of transcendence (G‑d beyond and above the world) and immanence (G‑d involved with creation). The concept of Shekinah refers to G‑d’s dwelling or presence among people, a helpful way to think about how a transcendent deity is nonetheless experienced in community and worship. Different Jewish traditions emphasize aspects of G‑d differently: Orthodox teaching stresses divine law and sovereignty, while some modern or liberal approaches highlight ethical attributes such as justice and compassion.

## Covenant, scripture and law: Torah, Tenakh and Talmud
The covenant with Abraham and its renewal at Sinai under Moses is the foundational story that explains the special relationship between G‑d and the Jewish people. The Torah (the first five books of the Tenakh) contains the core commandments given at Sinai: it is the primary source of authority for belief and practice. The wider Tenakh (Torah, Prophets and Writings) and the Talmud (rabbinic commentary including Mishnah and Gemara) develop interpretation, law and ethics. Jewish law (halakhah) is the practical outworking of these texts and traditions; it frames daily life from prayer to food and family obligations. Different Jewish groups place different weight on rabbinic law: Orthodox communities generally follow halakhah closely, Conservative communities seek a middle way of historical development and modern relevance, and Reform communities allow for individual choice and less literal application of ritual laws. When studying practices, always link them to these sources: for example, explain how the mitzvot are rooted in the Torah and expanded by rabbinic interpretation.

## Mitzvot, ethics and the sanctity of life
Mitzvot are the commandments that shape moral and ritual life. Jewish ethics distinguishes between ritual commandments (how to worship, how to keep food laws) and ethical commandments (how to treat others). Concepts such as tzedakah (charity), tikkun olam (repairing the world) and the imperative to pursue justice are central. The idea of sanctity of life (pikuach nefesh) holds that saving a life overrides almost all other commandments; this principle influences Jewish responses to medical and ethical dilemmas and shows how law and compassion interact. Debates within Judaism include which obligations are absolute and which may be set aside for human welfare, and whether traditional gender roles in ritual life should be reinterpreted. These discussions are good material for exam answers that ask for comparison or evaluation of different views.

## Eschatology: soul, resurrection, judgement and the Messiah
Jewish beliefs about the afterlife and end times vary. Traditional concepts include a distinction between soul and body, ideas of resurrection and future judgement, Sheol as a shadowy abode, Gan Eden (a blissful state) and Gehenna (a purgatorial process). Some Jews focus more on communal remembrance and ethical legacy than on precise details of the afterlife. The Messiah (Mashiach) and the Messianic Age are also important concepts: classical Jewish expectation envisages a human leader who will restore Israel, bring peace and gather the exiles. Modern Jewish thought offers a range of interpretations from a literal personal Messiah to a more symbolic Messianic Age of global harmony. When answering exam questions, show this spectrum: state what the traditional view is, explain alternative understandings, and assess implications for Jewish attitudes to history, suffering and hope.

## Worship, synagogue and prayer
The synagogue is the centre of communal worship; its key features include the Ark holding the Torah scrolls, the Bimah where the Torah is read, and the Ner Tamid (eternal light) symbolising God’s continual presence. Jewish prayer life includes three daily services, an emphasis on communal prayer and the central recitation of the Shema and the Amidah. Private devotion, blessings (berakhot) and ritual observances in the home connect belief and daily life. The role of the Torah and its public reading, the use of Hebrew in liturgy, and physical symbols like the tallit (prayer shawl) and tefillin (phylacteries) vary by denomination: Orthodox services are traditionally in Hebrew and may separate men and women, while Reform services include the vernacular, mixed seating and often egalitarian participation for women. Understanding these practices and their sources will strengthen answers that ask about the importance of worship or differences between communities.

## Festivals, dietary laws and rites of passage
Jewish festivals mark history, gratitude and communal memory. Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish new year) and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) focus on repentance, the shofar and the Book of Life; Pesach (Passover) recalls the Exodus with the Seder meal and removal of chametz; Sukkot remembers the desert wanderings with the sukkah and lulav; Shavuot celebrates revelation at Sinai; Hanukkah commemorates religious freedom and the rededication of the Temple. Dietary laws (kashrut) distinguish permitted foods and require ritual slaughter; keeping kosher structures daily life and identity but observance varies widely. Life‑cycle rituals—brit milah (circumcision), naming ceremonies, bar/bat mitzvah, marriage with a ketubah (marriage contract) and traditional burial rites—connect individuals to community and covenant. Teachers should highlight how these practices express theology: the Seder is not only a meal but a living retelling of the covenant, while Shabbat embodies the sanctity of time and creation. When discussing festivals and rites, include how modern circumstances (living in non‑Jewish societies, medical issues) produce different approaches across Jewish movements.

## Exam technique
When answering GCSE questions on Judaism aim to balance accurate knowledge (AO1) with analysis and evaluation (AO2). For short questions ask yourself what factual point the question requires and answer concisely, using correct terms (for example: Shema, mitzvot, pikuach nefesh, Torah). For longer questions plan a clear structure: start with a definition and explanation, develop with evidence from scripture or practice, show how belief influences individuals and communities, and where relevant, present at least two viewpoints. In evaluative questions, explain differing interpretations across Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Judaism and assess strengths and weaknesses of each position before giving a supported conclusion. Use examples to illustrate points—describe a Shabbat table to show how belief in creation is lived out, or outline Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur practices to explain Jewish ideas about repentance. Refer explicitly to sources of wisdom and authority: name the Torah, Talmud or a specific biblical story when it supports your argument. Remember that some marks reward specialist terminology and clear expression, so plan time to write a conclusion that answers the question directly. For SPaG and higher marks, write in clear paragraphs, use technical terms correctly and check spelling of key words. Finally, practise past question types: describe/explain questions test knowledge; discuss/evaluate questions require judgment and comparison; compare questions expect similarities and differences. Structure, evidence and balanced evaluation will lift your answers from description to analysis and score highly.
