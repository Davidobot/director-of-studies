# Hinduism: beliefs and practices (GCSE Religious Studies Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview
Hinduism is a diverse and ancient religion with no single founder, no single sacred book and a wide variety of beliefs and practices. It is best understood as a family of related religious ideas and cultural practices developed over several thousand years in South Asia. For GCSE study we focus on core teachings that shape Hindu worldviews — such as the nature of the self, the cycle of rebirth, karma and moksha — and on the practices through which Hindus express devotion, mark life stages and address ethical responsibilities. Recognising diversity is essential: Hindus may emphasise different texts, gods, philosophical schools and ways of life, but many share common concepts that inform both private devotion and public action.

## Core beliefs: atman, samsara, karma and moksha
Central to Hindu thought is the idea of the atman, the eternal self or soul. Many Hindus believe the atman is the true identity of a person and that it persists beyond the death of the physical body. Connected with this is the idea of samsara, the cycle of birth, death and rebirth in which individual lives are continually repeated until liberation is achieved. Karma describes the moral law of cause and effect: actions in this life (and previous lives) create consequences that influence future births. Good actions tend to produce positive results, while harmful actions produce suffering.

Moksha, or liberation, is the release from samsara and the end of karmic bondage. Different Hindu traditions describe moksha in various ways: for some it is the soul’s union with Brahman, the ultimate reality; for others it is a state of perfected consciousness or an existence in a divine realm. Students should be aware that Hindus offer different routes to moksha and that ideas about the self and liberation are interpreted differently by schools such as Advaita Vedanta (which emphasises non-dual identity of atman and Brahman) and dualist traditions (which maintain a distinction between the individual soul and a personal God).

## Ultimate reality and manifestations of the divine
Hinduism deals with the idea of the divine both as an impersonal absolute (Brahman) and as personal gods and goddesses. Brahman is described in some texts as nirguna (without attributes) and in others as saguna (with attributes), approachable through deities. This philosophical flexibility allows Hindus to worship a wide range of deities while holding in reserve the idea of a single, all-pervading reality.

The Trimurti — Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer — is a traditional way of expressing the cyclical nature of the universe. The Tridevi (such as Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati/Durga) highlights feminine aspects of divinity, often associated with shakti, divine energy. Avatara are divine incarnations, most famously the avatars of Vishnu such as Rama and Krishna, who appear in sacred stories to restore dharma. Worship of murtis (images or statues) is common: for many Hindus a murti is a focal point for darshan, the experience of seeing and being seen by the deity. It is important to understand that within Hindu theology the murti is not merely a picture; for devotees it can become a living presence through ritual.

## Practices of worship, pilgrimage and sacred space
Hindu practice blends public and private devotion. Daily puja at home or in a temple involves offerings, chanting, lighting lamps (arati), and reciting mantras. Temples are designed to facilitate darshan and ritual. Pilgrimage is a major aspect of Hindu religious life: sacred rivers and cities — most notably the Ganges and the city of Varanasi — attract pilgrims seeking purification, merit and spiritual benefit. Festivals such as Diwali, the festival of lights, and Holi, the festival of colours, mark important stories and seasonal cycles; they combine communal celebration with religious meaning, reinforcing identity and moral lessons.

Rituals are also central to life stages. Birth ceremonies, naming rites, marriage rituals (which often emphasise samskaras, sacred ceremonies) and funeral rites all reflect beliefs about karma, rebirth and the social importance of family. For example, certain funeral rites performed on the banks of the Ganges are believed to aid the soul’s journey and to influence future rebirth.

## Paths to liberation and ethical life: the yogas, dharma and purusharthas
Hindus recognise multiple paths (margas) to spiritual progress. Jnana yoga stresses knowledge and philosophical study, bhakti yoga emphasises devotion and love for a personal god, karma yoga highlights selfless action and duty, and raja or ashtanga yoga focuses on meditation and disciplined practice. Many Hindus combine elements of these paths in everyday life.

This practical variety is supported by the concept of dharma, which means duty, law or the right way of living. Dharma varies with role, stage of life and social context. The purusharthas describe four aims of life: dharma (duty/ethics), artha (wealth and prosperity), kama (pleasure and emotional fulfilment) and moksha (liberation). Together they frame ethical decision-making: a balanced life seeks material and emotional well-being in ways that do not block spiritual progress.

The traditional social framework of varna (often translated as caste) and ashrama (life stages) historically guided duties and roles. Modern Hindu attitudes vary widely: some see varna as a spiritual division of work, while others criticise caste-based discrimination and support reform. It is important to recognise both the textual bases and the lived realities, as well as reform movements and legal changes that challenge unjust practices.

## Festivals, rites of passage and the role of sacred texts
Festivals bring religious stories to life and provide teaching moments. Diwali celebrates the return of Rama in the Ramayana or the triumph of light over darkness more generally, while Holi commemorates seasonal renewal and Krishna’s playful pastimes in some traditions. Other festivals such as Navaratri or Ganesh Chaturthi mark the worship of particular deities and reinforce community ties. Sacred texts — from the Vedas and Upanishads to the epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata and devotional literature — supply the myths, teachings and guidelines that underpin festivals, ethical reasoning and philosophical reflection. The Bhagavad Gita, as a core text, offers a compact summary of karma, bhakti and jnana approaches through the dialogue of Krishna and Arjuna and is often used by students to illustrate interactions between duty, action and spiritual wisdom.

## Ethics, social responsibility and contemporary issues
Hindu ethical teaching includes principles such as ahimsa (non-violence), daya (compassion) and satya (truth). Ahimsa plays a central role in attitudes toward animals and the environment; it influenced major figures such as Gandhi, whose emphasis on non-violent resistance and social reform drew on Hindu ideas while applying them to political life. Hindu organisations today engage in charitable work, environmental protection and social service, reflecting the values of seva (service) and dana (giving).

Contemporary ethical debates within Hindu communities include responses to gender equality, caste discrimination, medical ethics and the place of tradition in a plural society. Different Hindu groups interpret texts and customs in ways that can support progressive change or, alternatively, defend traditional norms. Teaching should highlight how scripture, commentary and lived experience interact to produce a range of views rather than a single “Hindu” answer on any complex issue.

## Exam technique
To score highly in exams, students must combine clear knowledge (AO1) with balanced analysis and evaluation (AO2). Begin short answers with concise definitions — for example, “Atman is the eternal self” — and then add a short explanation or example, such as how belief in atman affects views on death and rebirth. For medium-length answers aim to explain a belief or practice and then show its significance for individuals or communities; use a named text or practice to support your point, for example referencing the Bhagavad Gita when discussing karma and duty. In extended essays plan a clear structure: start with a focused introduction that defines key terms, develop two or three analytical paragraphs that explain teachings and include differing viewpoints, then evaluate by weighing strengths and weaknesses and finish with a reasoned conclusion. When evaluating, consider differences between Hindu traditions, practical consequences and alternative ethical perspectives. Use specialist vocabulary accurately (for example, samsara, dharma, moksha, bhakti, arati) and remember that spelling, punctuation and grammar will be assessed, so write clearly and proofread if time allows. Always aim to support claims with examples — a festival, a ritual, a teaching or a modern figure such as Gandhi — and when asked to “discuss” or “evaluate,” ensure your answer considers more than one side of the argument before reaching a judgement.
