# Migrants to Britain (c.1250–present) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Key themes and questions
Migration to Britain is a long‑term story of movement, settlement and encounter. From medieval merchants and refugees to modern economic migrants and asylum‑seekers, different groups have come for many reasons: fleeing persecution, seeking work, joining military or colonial networks, or following family. The topic asks you to explain why people came, what their experiences were in Britain, and what impact they had. It also asks you to link these changes to wider forces: Britain’s international connections, changing beliefs and attitudes, government policy, economic push and pull factors, and improvements in transport and communications. Keep these threads in mind as you move through the periods: the reasons and experiences of migrants often change when the political or economic context changes, but some continuities — such as prejudice and cultural exchange — run through the whole period.

## Medieval Britain (c.1250–c.1500)
In the later middle ages migration to England was less about mass movements of labour and more about small but significant groups who filled specialised roles. Jewish communities were established in towns from the Norman period and played important roles in finance and trade, but from 1290 they faced expulsion by royal decree; this event is a clear example of how official policy could abruptly end the presence of a community. At the same time merchants and skilled workers from the Low Countries — Dutch and Flemish cloth workers, for example — settled in English ports and towns, bringing skills and linking English economy to European markets. Attitudes to migrants were mixed: towns often welcomed skilled migrants for economic benefit, while official responses could swing between tolerance and restriction depending on religion, economic anxiety or politics. Rare but important early non‑European presences also existed; individuals from Africa and Asia appear in medieval records, often in service roles, reminding us that Britain was never entirely isolated. Communications were slow and travel risky, so most migrants settled close to ports or urban centres where work and community could be found.

## Early Modern Britain (c.1500–c.1750)
The early modern period saw new patterns of migration driven by religious upheaval and expanding trade. Protestant refugees reached English shores following the Reformation on the continent: Huguenots fleeing persecution in France after 1685 established textile workshops in Spitalfields and elsewhere, bringing skilled crafts that revitalised industries. The Palatines — German Protestants displaced by war and hardship in the early eighteenth century — arrived as families seeking new opportunities. There were also movements of Romany Gypsies and small numbers of Jews who, after being readmitted in the 1650s, began to rebuild communities. Britain’s growing overseas connections brought the first more sustained presence of Africans and South Asians: some were free individuals working as servants, sailors or interpreters, while others were part of early colonial networks and household arrangements (for example ayahs accompanying British families from India). Attitudes were shaped by religion and emerging ideas of nation; government responses ranged from invitation for useful skills to restrictions or social exclusion for those seen as different. Improvements in shipbuilding and the growth of Atlantic trade made movement more feasible and connected migrants to wider global patterns.

## Industrial and Imperial Britain (c.1750–c.1900)
Industrialisation and empire transformed migration on a much larger scale. The Great Famine in Ireland in the 1840s produced a mass movement of Irish migrants into British cities; their arrival reshaped urban demography and led to the formation of lively Irish communities in cities such as Liverpool, Glasgow and London, but also provoked hostility and competition for work. Empire meant more people from the Indian subcontinent, China and Africa came to British ports as sailors, servants or labourers — lascars, for example, served on merchant vessels and settled in port towns, while small Chinese communities grew around seafaring hubs. Large numbers of Eastern European Jews fleeing persecution in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries settled in the East End of London, adding to the urban economy and political life while also facing overcrowding and discrimination. Migrants often met both welcome and hostility: employers valued cheap labour and specific skills, whereas competition during economic downturns could produce scapegoating and restrictive local measures. The railways, steamships and telegraph made travel faster and contacts with homelands easier, enabling chain migration where established migrants helped new arrivals.

## Britain since c.1900
The twentieth century brought both forced and voluntary movements that reshaped modern Britain. During the two world wars, people fled from Europe and the continent’s conflicts produced refugees; the Kindertransport in 1938–39 brought many Jewish children to safety in Britain. Wartime fears also led to the internment or surveillance of ‘enemy aliens’ and revealed how migration could become politicised in times of crisis. After 1945 the decline of empire and labour shortages in Britain led to a new wave of migration from the Caribbean, South Asia and Africa. The arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush in 1948 symbolises this era: many Caribbean migrants were invited or encouraged to come as part of post‑war rebuilding. The 1948 British nationality framework made migration from the Commonwealth possible, but subsequent decades saw increasing attempts to restrict and regulate entry through Acts in the 1960s and 1970s as attitudes in parts of British society hardened. Migrants continued to build communities, open businesses, and influence culture, while also encountering racism expressed in everyday life and through violent incidents such as the late 1950s disturbances. From the 1980s onwards new patterns emerged: asylum seekers and refugees from conflicts in the Balkans, Africa and the Middle East, and migrants from the enlarged European Union after 2004, changed the composition of Britain yet again. Transport and communications now created transnational lives: easy air travel, cheap phone calls and later the internet allowed migrants to maintain close ties with home while integrating into Britain.

## Experiences of migrants and British responses
Across the centuries the lived experience of migrants varied widely according to origin, religion, class, gender and the town or city they entered. Some migrants were welcomed for skills — Huguenot silk weavers or Jewish tailors both helped industries — while others were exploited as cheap labour or pushed into marginal economic niches. Settlements concentrated where work and networks existed: ports, industrial towns and metropolitan suburbs became focal points for particular communities. Social responses combined local hospitality, indifference and hostility. Governments sometimes acted to encourage migration to meet labour needs and at other times passed laws to restrict or control arrival and naturalisation; local authorities could be more punitive or more welcoming depending on economic pressures. Cultural impact was substantial: migrants introduced foods, crafts, languages, faiths and political ideas. Over time migrants formed cafés, places of worship, newspapers and political societies, contributing to the multicultural fabric of British towns. At the same time, racism, restrictive legislation and social exclusion meant that many migrants faced systemic barriers; these realities produced anti‑racist movements and campaigns for equal rights in the twentieth century.

## Causes and consequences — how historians think about migration
Historians explain migration in terms of push and pull factors. Push factors include famine, religious persecution, war and economic collapse; pull factors include job opportunities, religious tolerance, imperial ties and family links. Britain’s international connections — through trade networks, empire and later global capitalism — created both opportunities and channels for movement. Changing beliefs and values shaped whether migrants were seen as useful or threatening; interpretations of their impact also change over time. Some historians emphasise the economic benefits migrants brought to British industry and commerce, while others stress the social tensions and injustices migrants faced. The long view produces different emphases: a medieval chronicler might focus on security and order, an eighteenth‑century merchant on skills and profit, while a twentieth‑century activist would emphasise rights and equality. To fully understand the topic you should be able to move between local examples (a Huguenot neighbourhood in Spitalfields, an Irish quarter in Liverpool, a Windrush family in 1950s London) and wider national developments such as legislation, war or economic shift.

## Using sources and forming interpretations
When you study migrants to Britain you will meet many types of sources: parish registers, tax records, port lists, letters, newspaper reports, government papers, photographs and oral testimony. Physical evidence — buildings, places of worship and street names — can also reveal the presence and influence of communities. Sources must be used with care: a hostile newspaper report shows an attitude but not the whole truth, while official returns can undercount migrants. Interpretation requires placing sources in context, comparing different kinds of evidence and recognising bias. Historians ask how and why accounts differ: an official report might stress disorder to justify restrictions, whereas community memoirs emphasise contribution and belonging. Learning to weigh these sources and to explain why interpretations differ is central to higher marks in the depth and world studies of the course.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on migration demands two linked skills: secure factual knowledge and clear analytical thinking. For shorter recall questions practise precise dates, names and examples (for instance, the expulsion of Jews in 1290; Huguenot settlement in Spitalfields; Irish migration after the Famine; the arrival of Windrush migrants in 1948). For explanation and “why” questions always use cause-and-effect language and show how factors interact: explain the immediate cause, then link it to longer‑term economic or political developments. For “how far” or evaluation questions structure your answer with a balanced argument. Begin with a clear judgement that answers the question, then provide two or three developed paragraphs that support your view with evidence and explanation, considering counter‑arguments before a brief conclusion that reinforces your overall judgement.

When analysing sources, start by identifying the origin, purpose and tone, then explain what the source reveals and what it does not show. Use your own knowledge to add context and to test the source’s claims. For interpretation questions compare two views by identifying specific points of agreement and difference, and explain reasons for these differences — for example, different authors’ backgrounds, the time when the interpretation was written, or the intended audience.

Always aim for precise, linked paragraphs: make a clear point, explain it with relevant evidence, and then show why it matters in answering the question. Use specialist terms where appropriate (e.g. “push‑pull factors”, “chain migration”, “naturalisation”, “asylum seeker”), and take care with spelling, punctuation and grammar to score SPaG marks. Practise past questions under timed conditions, and prepare a selection of vivid examples from each period so you can support any answer with concrete evidence.
