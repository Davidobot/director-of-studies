# Castles: Form and Function c.1000–1750 (Kenilworth) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why study castles and why Kenilworth?
Castles are an ideal lens through which to explore continuity and change in medieval and early modern Britain because they combine military, political, social and cultural functions in one place. For the OCR GCSE History A course the study of castles c.1000–1750 centres on a single, carefully chosen site: Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire. Kenilworth is an excellent case study because its long history—from Norman foundations through baronial rebellion, royal ownership, Tudor transformation and Civil War slighting—shows how a single site can be adapted to meet changing needs and fashions. Studying Kenilworth helps you practise both the factual knowledge required for AO1 and the source and interpretation skills required for AO3 and AO4, while also supporting synoptic links with themes such as power, war and society.

## Historical background and long-term development
From the Norman Conquest onwards, the castle became a central instrument of conquest and lordship. Initially, many castles were quick-to-build timber motte-and-bailey fortresses erected to control territory and assert authority after 1066. Over time these timber structures were replaced with stone curtain walls, keeps and gatehouses that were harder to undermine and better suited to long-term occupation. Kenilworth began as an important fortress founded by Geoffrey de Clinton in the early twelfth century and grew into a powerful and prestigious stronghold. In the thirteenth century the castle was at the centre of baronial conflict when Simon de Montfort’s supporters held it and it endured the famous prolonged siege of 1266. By the later Middle Ages, wealthy magnates such as John of Gaunt invested in Kenilworth, balancing defensive needs with accommodation and display. The sixteenth century saw a different emphasis: the aristocratic desire to entertain and impress led Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, to create new lodgings and gardens for Elizabeth I’s renowned visit in 1575. Finally, the English Civil War and parliamentary policies resulted in the slighting of many castles; Kenilworth’s fortifications were deliberately damaged in the mid-seventeenth century, leaving it partly ruinous and transforming its role in the landscape.

## Functions across time: defence, power, administration and display
Castles were never static in purpose. Early on they were primarily military installations designed to defend territory and deter rebellion, but they were also symbols of lordship and administrative centres from the outset. Kenilworth demonstrates this multiplicity. In its early centuries it served as a fortress and local centre of governance where the lord exercised justice, collected revenues and asserted control over the surrounding countryside. When siege warfare became a political instrument—as during the baronial wars—the castle’s military role became paramount. Yet even at the height of their defensive purpose castles housed households with kitchens, workshops and chapels; they were workplaces for many craftsmen and servants as well as homes for the elite. By the late medieval and early modern periods the emphasis at places like Kenilworth shifted towards comfort, hospitality and display. Robert Dudley’s investment in state apartments, sumptuous banquets and elaborate gardens shows how castles could be transformed into stages for political manoeuvre through favour and spectacle. The changing military technology of the early modern period — especially the rise of artillery — also changed the defensive value of medieval castles, accelerating their conversion into residences or their abandonment.

## Kenilworth Castle: key phases and people
Kenilworth’s development can be read as a sequence of phases that reflect broader historical changes. The castle’s origins lie with Geoffrey de Clinton in the early twelfth century; his initial works established Kenilworth as a stronghold in the Midlands. In the thirteenth century Kenilworth became a focal point in the baronial conflicts. The prolonged siege of 1266 is a classic example of how castles could be both a refuge and a target, and the siege’s duration left traces in chronicles and material remains. In the late fourteenth century John of Gaunt, one of the most powerful magnates of the realm, further adapted the site, underlining how royal and noble patronage shaped castle architecture. The most famous phase for many students is the sixteenth century, when Robert Dudley, as Elizabeth I’s favourite, rebuilt parts of Kenilworth to entertain the queen in 1575 with lavish accommodation and pageantry that reveal the castle’s role as a centre for courtly display. During the seventeenth century, Civil War loyalties meant that Kenilworth was garrisoned and subsequently slighted under Parliamentarian decisions after the conflict; the deliberate partial demolition converted it into the ruin that visitors see and that archaeologists study today.

## Physical and documentary evidence: how we know what we know
Understanding Kenilworth depends on combining the castle’s surviving fabric with contemporary documents and later accounts. The physical remains—curtain walls, gatehouse structures, the layout of halls and lodgings, and traces of water defences such as the artificial mere—tell us about construction phases, defensive priorities and later alterations. Archaeological excavation has revealed foundations and artefacts that help date changes and reveal domestic life. Documentary evidence complements the archaeology: building accounts, royal licenses, household inventories, and cost records show what was ordered, who worked there and how spaces were used. For the Elizabethan period the cost-books and descriptions of the 1575 entertainments survive in accounts and letters, helping historians reconstruct the spectacle Dudley intended. Maps, plans and later antiquarian drawings provide visual evidence of the castle’s changing appearance across centuries. Each type of evidence brings strengths and limitations: the physical fabric gives direct evidence of form but is often fragmentary; documents can be rich in detail but biased by their authors’ aims. Effective study requires bringing these strands together to form balanced explanations.

## Interpreting change and continuity: common pitfalls and useful approaches
When answering questions about castles you will be asked to assess both change and continuity and to explain why functions altered over time. A useful approach is to consider long-term structural continuities—such as a castle’s location on a strategic site or its role as a local administrative centre—alongside shorter-term changes driven by political events, technological developments or elite tastes. For example, Kenilworth’s strategic riverside location remained important across centuries, but the manner of its use shifted from military stronghold to theatrical residence. Be cautious about teleological arguments that assume castles simply “declined” because of guns; instead, explain how new military realities made certain medieval features less effective and how that encouraged owners to adapt sites for new roles. Another common pitfall is treating the castle as solely a symbol of elite power; discuss the experiences of non-elite groups too, including craftsmen, servants and local communities affected by garrisoning, sieges and the presence of a major household. Always ground explanations in specific evidence from Kenilworth where possible—architectural features, named owners, documented events such as the 1266 siege and the 1575 visit—which demonstrates your AO1 knowledge and supports AO2 reasoning.

## Using sources and tackling interpretations
The OCR exam will test not just what you know but how you use sources and engage with interpretations. When asked to analyse sources about Kenilworth, begin by establishing the provenance: who produced the source, when, and for what purpose. Consider its utility for particular historical questions and its limitations. For example, a household account that lists expenditures for building lodgings under Dudley is very useful for reconstructing what was built, but it may not tell you how guests actually experienced the spaces. When comparing two sources, focus on points of agreement and difference and explain why those differences might exist, drawing on context such as political motive, intended audience or genre. In interpretation questions you will be asked to explain why historians might disagree about the castle’s significance; use the physical and documentary evidence to show how different pieces of evidence can lead to different conclusions and then evaluate which interpretation is more convincing and why.

## Teaching and revision connections
Kenilworth sits naturally within broader themes in the OCR specification. It connects closely with studies of power and monarchy because the castle’s owners repeatedly used it to claim and display authority. It also links to the study of war and society: sieges, garrisons and Civil War slighting show the human and political effects of conflict. When revising, practice structuring answers that combine factual narrative with analysis. Use Kenilworth to illustrate second-order concepts such as cause, consequence, continuity and change. Make sure you can place specific events—like the 1266 siege, John of Gaunt’s modifications, the 1575 progress, and the Civil War slighting—into a clear chronology and explain their significance for the castle’s function. Rehearse writing short source evaluations and longer essays that reach a balanced judgement, as these skills map directly onto the assessment objectives and the kinds of questions you will meet in the exam.

## Exam technique
Answering castle questions well requires clear structure, precise evidence and explicit use of the assessment objectives. For AO1, ensure your narrative is accurate: name dates, owners and events, and explain how changes to the site reflect those events. For AO2, use second-order concepts—cause, consequence, continuity and change—to organise your explanation, for example by explaining why the rise of gunpowder weapons affected the defensive role of castles. For AO3 source questions, state who created the source and why, assess its usefulness and limitations, and, where asked to compare, focus on similarities and differences supported by contextual reasons. For AO4 interpretation questions, explain why historians might reach different views by referring to the types of evidence each uses and the different questions they ask; then make a reasoned judgement supported by specific examples from Kenilworth. Manage your time so you allocate roughly one hour to the period or depth section and 30–45 minutes to the historic environment section as recommended in the specification. For extended answers aim for a clear introduction that outlines your argument, two or three developed paragraphs that use evidence to support points, and a conclusion that summarises your judgement. Remember the SPaG marks: write clearly, use correct specialist terminology (for example motte, bailey, curtain wall, slighting, progress), and check spelling and punctuation where you can. Practising with past paper questions on Kenilworth, and writing source evaluations under timed conditions, will build the confidence and precision you need for the examination.
