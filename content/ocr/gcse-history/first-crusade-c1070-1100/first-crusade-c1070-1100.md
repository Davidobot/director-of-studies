# The First Crusade (c.1070–1100) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction and overview
The First Crusade was a military and religious expedition launched by Western European Christians that arrived in the eastern Mediterranean between 1096 and 1099. It resulted in the capture of Jerusalem and the creation of several Latin states in the Near East. The crusade brought into contact Latin Christendom, the Byzantine Empire and a variety of Muslim polities, producing dramatic warfare, political change and cultural exchange. For GCSE study the focus is on causes (political, religious and social), the main events from preaching to the capture of Jerusalem, the establishment of the Crusader states, and the ways historians and sources interpret these events.

## Background and immediate causes
The roots of the First Crusade lie in developments in the eleventh century. The Byzantine Empire under Emperor Alexios I Komnenos faced pressure from Seljuk Turkish forces, especially after the loss at Manzikert in 1071, which left large parts of Anatolia vulnerable. Byzantine appeals for military help reached the West. At the same time Latin Christendom experienced a revival of papal authority and reform. Pope Urban II, responding both to Byzantine requests and to wider ambitions to assert papal leadership, used the Council of Clermont in November 1095 to call for armed aid to recover Christian territory and secure pilgrim access to the Holy Places. Other causes were social and economic: a culture of knighthood that valued military action, opportunities for land and wealth for younger sons, and the promise of spiritual rewards such as indulgences for those who fought. Pilgrimage, the memory of Islamic-Christian competition over territory, and fears about the safety of Byzantium and Christian pilgrims all contributed to a powerful mixture of motives.

## Preaching and recruitment: the People’s Crusade and the princes
Urban II’s call produced an immediate and unexpected popular response. A wave of enthusiasm spread through France and the Low Countries, and groups of peasants and lesser knights set out quickly. The People’s Crusade, led by charismatic preachers such as Peter the Hermit, left before the main princes and was poorly organized. It included many who lacked military experience and ran into disaster in Anatolia in 1096, suffering massacres and collapse. At the same time the main, better-armed expedition gathered under notable leaders: Raymond of Toulouse, Godfrey of Bouillon, Bohemond of Taranto, Robert of Normandy, Tancred and others. These noble leaders were motivated by a mixture of piety, personal ambition and the chance for land and prestige. Before setting out many took vows and were promised remission of sins by the papacy, a promise that gave the enterprise a strong religious legitimacy.

## Into Asia Minor: Nicaea and Dorylaeum
The main crusading armies reached Constantinople in 1097 where Emperor Alexios sought oaths of loyalty and the return of former Byzantine territory. Relations between the crusaders and Byzantium were uneasy; Alexios needed help but also sought to recover land without losing imperial authority. The campaign into Anatolia involved siege warfare and set-piece battles. The siege of Nicaea in May–June 1097 ended when the city surrendered to the Byzantines after secret negotiations with Alexios rather than to the crusaders themselves, increasing tension. Shortly afterwards the crusader army defeated a Seljuk force at the Battle of Dorylaeum (July 1097), demonstrating the effectiveness of heavy cavalry and combined forces when properly led. The crossing of Asia Minor, however, tested logistics and unity: long marches, shortages of supplies and the divided leadership highlighted the fragility of the crusading coalition.

## Antioch and Jerusalem: sieges, hardship and victory
The long siege of Antioch (October 1097–June 1098) was one of the most dramatic episodes. Crusaders endured starvation and disease while trying to break the city’s formidable defences. Internal rivalries created disunity, but persistence, the capture of key positions and the defection of some local actors allowed the crusaders to enter the city. Their position soon seemed threatened when a large Muslim relief army under Kerbogha arrived. Crusader leaders rallied decisively, and Kerbogha’s defeat in June 1098 secured control of Antioch. The march south to Jerusalem took time because of divisions and logistical delays, but in June–July 1099 the crusaders reached the city. The siege of Jerusalem culminated in a violent assault and the capture of the city on 15 July 1099. The sack that followed involved extensive killing of many of its Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, an event remembered in both Western and Eastern sources for its brutality. The victors established the Kingdom of Jerusalem and other crusader states, setting up Latin governments where none had existed before.

## Establishing the Crusader states and immediate consequences
By 1100 the crusaders had formed four principal Latin states: the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa and the County of Tripoli. These states were run by western nobles and depended on tenuous lines of supply and reinforcement from Europe. The relationship with Byzantium remained strained. Bohemond and others were reluctant to return conquered lands to the empire as Alexios had expected, producing rivalry and occasional conflict. For the Muslim world the crusade exposed the political fragmentation of the region; rivalries among Muslim rulers helped the crusaders achieve initial successes. In Europe the crusade had immediate social and religious effects: pilgrimage routes were reopened in some areas, the papacy’s moral authority was enhanced in the short term, and the idea of ‘holy war’ against non-Christians was strengthened. The violent anti-Jewish attacks that accompanied the raised enthusiasm in the Rhineland in 1096 were a tragic and significant consequence that affected Jewish communities across Europe.

## Sources and interpretations
Our knowledge of the First Crusade depends on a range of sources from different perspectives, and students must understand their value and limitations. Latin eyewitness accounts such as Fulcher of Chartres, Raymond of Aguilers and the anonymous Gesta Francorum offer detailed narrative of events and reflect the crusaders’ religious motivations. The Byzantine view is represented in Anna Komnene’s Alexiad, which is critical of some crusader behaviour and provides context about Alexios’ diplomatic and military concerns. Muslim chroniclers, such as Ibn al-Athir and later writers, describe the impact on Muslim polities and often highlight disunity among Muslim leaders. Each type of source is shaped by purpose and perspective: Latin chronicles aim to justify and celebrate the Christian victory and emphasize religious fervour; Byzantine texts defend imperial policy and may mistrust Western motives; Muslim accounts sometimes downplay initial disunity but provide crucial counterpoints. Historians debate motivations and significance. Older interpretations emphasised the crusade as a purely religious pilgrimage and sign of papal power, while more recent work situates it within social, economic and political contexts, seeing it also as an opportunistic expansion by knights seeking land and status, or as an early form of colonial enterprise. Teaching should guide students to compare sources, identify bias, and use knowledge to assess reliability.

## Significance and longer-term legacy
The First Crusade had important short-term successes but its longer-term significance is mixed. Immediately it transformed the political map of the Levant, established Latin states that lasted in various forms for decades, and altered relations between East and West. It intensified contact between European and Mediterranean cultures, affecting trade, ideas and military techniques. It accelerated militarisation of parts of European society and gave the papacy a new instrument of influence. The crusade also left a legacy of violence and mistrust between religious communities. Over the longer term Muslim unity eventually hardened under leaders such as Nur ad-Din and Saladin, who in the twelfth century began to recover territory lost to crusaders. In European memory the First Crusade inspired later crusading efforts and the idea of religious warfare; it also became a subject of literary and cultural reflection. As a historical episode it remains contested: pupils should be aware that its causes, character and consequences are debated and that interpretations change as historians ask new questions.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on the First Crusade, begin by reading the question carefully and identifying which assessment skill it targets: factual recall, explanation, source analysis or interpretation. For factual recall and ‘describe’ questions use precise dates, names and short, focused paragraphs that cover the required points. For ‘explain’ and ‘why’ questions organise your answer into a clear argument: state the main factor, explain how it caused or shaped events, support with specific evidence (for example, Alexios’ appeal after Manzikert, Urban II’s speech at Clermont, the role of leaders like Godfrey and Bohemond), and consider other factors before giving a short judgement. For source-based questions always start by summarising what the source says, then analyse its content by using internal features (tone, emphasis, language), place it in context (who wrote it, when, and why), and use your own knowledge to support or challenge its reliability. Consider what the source reveals and what it omits. When asked about interpretations or ‘how far’ questions, set out the view given, show points of agreement and disagreement using specific evidence from events (for example contrasting the People’s Crusade and the princes, or the siege of Antioch and the fall of Jerusalem), and weigh the evidence to reach a balanced conclusion. Time management is crucial: allocate time according to marks, leave a few minutes to proofread extended answers and to make sure you have addressed the question directly. Use key terms such as ‘siege’, ‘indulgence’, ‘pilgrimage’, ‘oath’, and ‘crusader states’ accurately, and when appropriate explain the significance of events rather than only narrating them. Practise structuring paragraphs with a clear point, evidence and explanation, and practise source evaluation by asking: who produced this, why was it produced, what perspective does it show, and how does my own knowledge help me judge its usefulness?
