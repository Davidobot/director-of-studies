# Crime and Punishment (c.1250–present) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: what this study is about
Crime and punishment is a thematic study that follows long-term change and continuity in how British society defined wrongdoing, how it enforced the law, and how it punished offenders from around 1250 to the present. The theme asks three central questions through four broad periods: what kinds of crime were recorded and feared; who was responsible for enforcing order and how effective were they; and how did punishments change over time? To answer those questions you must combine factual knowledge (what happened and when) with second-order historical thinking such as cause and consequence, continuity and change, and significance. Throughout the topic five factors—beliefs and values, wealth and poverty, urbanisation, government, and technology—help explain why crime and punishment developed the way they did. Good revision focuses on clear examples (local or national), the shifting social context behind laws and punishments, and how ordinary people experienced crime and justice.

## Crime and punishment in medieval Britain (c.1250–c.1500)
In the later Middle Ages most communities handled crime locally. The manor court, the hundred court and royal courts all had roles depending on the offence and the accused. The nature of crime ranged from violent theft and homicide to what we would now call moral offences—drunkenness, sexual misdemeanour and breaches of social norms. Community mechanisms such as the hue and cry and the system of tithings made local people responsible for policing one another. Church courts dealt with moral and spiritual offences, offering penances rather than corporal punishments in many cases. Punishments were public and designed to shame as much as to deter: stocks, pillory, whipping and fines were common, and capital punishment—usually hanging—applied for serious crime. Imprisonment was rare and often used to hold suspects until trial or to coerce payment rather than as a long-term sentence. Beliefs and values, especially the pervasive influence of religion, shaped explanations for crime, and events such as the Black Death changed social structures and sometimes increased disorder. The picture that emerges is of a largely localised system where social control depended on community obligation rather than a centralised police force.

## Early modern changes: crime, witchcraft and the Bloody Code (c.1500–c.1750)
The period from 1500 to 1750 saw profound religious, political and social shifts that affected crime and punishment. The Reformation and the breakdown of some older authorities altered the balance between church and state, and national responses to outbreaks of plague and social disorder show greater central involvement. New anxieties appeared: vagrancy and begging attracted harsh measures as the state tried to manage the visible consequences of population movement. Moral crimes were increasingly criminalised, and witchcraft trials at the local level reflected a mix of superstition, gendered fears and local tensions. The later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries witnessed the imposition of the so-called Bloody Code, an expansion in the number of offences carrying the death penalty, reflecting elite anxieties about property and order. Even so, enforcement remained uneven: courts, magistrates and juries all shaped outcomes, and local attitudes could mitigate harsh sentences. The growth of towns and trade brought new forms of crime, while responses such as the early professionalisation of crime-fighting—most notably the Bow Street officers and later the idea of a paid, organised force—began to appear as 18th‑century pressures made local, voluntary policing less effective.

## Industrial Britain: police, prisons, transportation and reform (c.1750–c.1900)
Industrialisation and urbanisation changed the scale and visibility of crime. Rapid growth of cities created crowded slums and new opportunities for theft, violent crime and disorder. The response was a mixture of punishment and reform. Transportation to Australia became a major sentence from the late eighteenth century and was used both to remove offenders and to supply colonial labour. The nineteenth century saw a collapse of the Bloody Code in practice: many capital sentences were commuted, while imprisonment became the principal form of punishment. Prison reformers such as John Howard and Elizabeth Fry campaigned for more humane conditions; the development of the separate and silent systems aimed to reform prisoners through discipline and labour. The most significant institutional change was the creation of modern policing. The Metropolitan Police, established in 1829, and subsequent county forces introduced the model of paid, uniformed officers responsible for preventing crime and maintaining order rather than merely chasing criminals after an offence. This period also saw changing attitudes about poverty and crime, with some arguing that social conditions caused crime and others emphasising individual responsibility. Technological changes such as improvements in transport and communication affected criminal activity and policing alike.

## Britain since c.1900: modern crime, technology and changing punishments
The twentieth century introduced new types of crime, new policing methods and large-scale state involvement in welfare and law. Two world wars reshaped social attitudes and accelerated technological change. The professionalisation of police forces continued, with increasing use of forensics, fingerprinting (late nineteenth to early twentieth century), and later DNA profiling transforming investigations. Crime patterns shifted too: the twentieth century saw rises and falls in different offences, growth in organised and white-collar crime, and new threats such as politically motivated violence and terrorism which produced emergency legislation. Punishments evolved as society debated the purpose of punishment—deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation—and moved away from public corporal sentences. Capital punishment for murder was effectively ended in 1965 and later abolished, reflecting broader humanitarian concerns. The late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have brought debates about prison overcrowding, restorative justice, community sentencing, and surveillance technologies such as CCTV, which have increased state capacity to monitor behaviour. Throughout, government policy, changing public attitudes, and technological advances have reshaped both how crime is defined and how society responds.

## Themes and factors: explaining long-term change and continuity
Across the four periods five factors help explain why crime and punishment changed. Beliefs, attitudes and values mattered: religious explanations in the Middle Ages and early modern witch trials show how ideas about sin and devilry shaped responses, while later humanitarian ideas underpinned prison reform and the abolition of public executions. Wealth and poverty were central: inequality, economic crisis and seasonal unemployment often produced increases in property crime and vagrancy, prompting punitive or reformist responses depending on political culture. Urbanisation made crime more visible and harder to police by traditional community methods, prompting the development of formal police forces. Government developed from a limited, local presence to a centralised actor able to legislate and create national institutions such as police and prisons, and to launch welfare measures that aimed to reduce the social causes of crime. Technology has steadily altered both crime and enforcement, from improved roads and sea travel facilitating highwaymen and smuggling, to fingerprinting, radio, forensic science and digital surveillance which have transformed detection and prevention. These factors often interacted: urban growth plus poverty plus new transport produced the conditions for professionalised policing and penal reform. At the same time, there is continuity: some crimes, like theft and violent assault, persist across centuries, and public anxiety about crime remains a powerful influence on policy.

## Making it concrete: useful example studies
To prepare effectively, focus on a few well-chosen case studies that illustrate broader trends. For the medieval period, the response to the Black Death and its effect on social order can explain shifts in crime and the use of corporal punishment. For early modern England, study witchcraft trials and vagrancy laws to show how beliefs and poverty influenced justice. For the industrial period, use the development of the Metropolitan Police in 1829 and the rise of transportation and nineteenth‑century prison reformers to link urbanisation, government and changing punishments. For the twentieth century, the abolition of public execution, the decline of the death penalty for murder in the 1960s, and the introduction of forensic techniques like fingerprinting and later DNA provide strong examples of how values and technology changed the criminal justice system. A good case study links facts (dates, names, institutions) with analysis of causes and consequences and shows how different groups experienced crime and punishment differently.

## Exam technique
Answer the exam tasks directly and support every claim with specific evidence. For short recall questions offer crisp facts: names, dates, or brief examples. For summary questions organise material into a clear narrative that addresses the command, using second-order concepts such as cause or consequence. For explanation questions show causal chains: give a reason, support it with an example, and explain the effect. When you are asked "How far" or to judge a statement, weigh arguments on both sides before reaching a balanced conclusion that explicitly addresses the stem. For thematic essays, divide your answer into periods and compare them: explain continuity as well as change and link each point to the five factors where relevant. Use case studies to give depth, and remember that interpretations and historians’ views will be tested in the depth studies; for the thematic paper focus on evidence and explanation but be prepared to discuss different viewpoints where asked. Keep an eye on time, plan a brief structure before writing, and aim for clarity in expression and correct specialist terms to pick up SPaG credit. Finally, practice past-style questions under timed conditions, review model answers to understand successful structures, and make sure you can move confidently between telling what happened and explaining why it mattered.
