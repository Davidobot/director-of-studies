# Britain in Peace and War (1900–1918) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why this period matters
The years 1900–1918 are central to understanding modern Britain because they bridge a confident pre-war society and the massive social and political upheaval of the First World War. Students study this period to explore whether Edwardian Britain was a “golden age” of peace and prosperity or a society under strain. The topic combines social history — living conditions, class and gender — with political developments such as the Liberal reforms and constitutional clashes, and with imperial and international matters that help explain how Britain moved from a world power at peace into total war. Being able to weigh evidence and different interpretations is as important here as knowing the key events, since historians disagree about how stable and prosperous pre-war Britain really was and about the extent to which the war changed British society.

## Wealth and class in Edwardian Britain
At the start of the twentieth century Britain remained a leading industrial and imperial power. Shipbuilding, coal, textiles and manufacturing still created great wealth and British influence stretched across an empire on which “the sun never set.” Cities were centres of industry, commerce and culture, with advances in technology and transport changing everyday life. Yet this surface prosperity coexisted with deep social divisions. Class distinctions remained marked: a small wealthy elite enjoyed leisure and political power, a broad middle class grew in professions and commerce, and a large working class laboured in factories, mines and docks, often in overcrowded urban housing.

A defining piece of contemporary evidence is the social survey carried out by Seebohm Rowntree in York at the turn of the century. His study showed a persistent level of primary poverty caused by low wages and irregular employment, challenging the idea that prosperity was universal. These social realities help explain political tensions and make the “golden age” argument more complicated: Britain had wealth, but that wealth was unevenly distributed and many people faced insecurity and poor living conditions.

## Politics: party conflict, reform and constitutional crisis
Politically, the early 1900s were a time of intense contest and reform. The Conservative government lost ground and the Liberal Party returned to power in 1906 promising social reform. Between 1906 and 1914 the Liberals introduced a series of measures aimed at reducing poverty and improving social welfare — what we call the Liberal reforms — including old-age pensions, the National Insurance Act and steps to improve health and employment prospects. These reforms reflected a new willingness by the state to intervene in social problems.

At the same time the old constitutional balance was under pressure. The People’s Budget of 1909, proposed by Chancellor David Lloyd George, sought to raise taxes on land and the wealthy to pay for naval expansion and social reforms. The House of Lords’ refusal to pass the budget led to crisis and two general elections in 1910. The dispute was only settled with the Parliament Act of 1911, which removed the Lords’ power to veto most money bills and established the supremacy of the elected Commons. Another major political development was the rise of the Labour Party, which began to represent working-class interests in Parliament and to challenge the two-party dominance. Industrial unrest and the growth of militant trade unions added pressure to the political scene, as employers, workers and government negotiated new social and economic relationships.

## Women and the campaign for the vote
Women’s lives in early twentieth-century Britain were shaped by stark inequalities of law, work and social expectation, but they were also a time of heightened political activity. The campaign for women’s suffrage took two main forms: the non-violent constitutional approach of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies (the suffragists) and the militant direct action of the Women’s Social and Political Union (the suffragettes). The suffragettes, led by the Pankhursts, used confrontation, window-smashing, arson and hunger strikes to force the issue into public attention. These tactics divided opinion and provoked strong government responses, including arrests and the controversial practice of force-feeding hunger strikers. The suffrage movement also revealed wider debates about women’s roles in society and inspired broader demands for social and political change.

Government responses up to 1914 included both repression and limited concessions; for example, authorities attempted to control militant action through police and legal measures, and Parliament continued to resist extending the franchise on the basis of age and property. The outbreak of war in 1914 changed the landscape: many women threw themselves into war work and voluntary organisations, and the national contribution of women helped shift public and political attitudes that contributed to the partial enfranchisement of women after the war.

## Empire, Ireland and international tensions
Attitudes towards the British Empire were complex and varied. For many the empire remained a source of pride and economic opportunity; imperial achievement and global trade were presented as evidence of Britain’s strength. However, events such as the Boer War at the turn of the century exposed contradictions: long guerrilla conflict, public concern about military performance and the use of concentration camps for civilians raised moral and strategic questions about imperial rule.

Ireland represented one of the most dangerous sources of domestic political tension. The Home Rule crisis of 1912–1914, which proposed devolving domestic government to an Irish parliament, split opinion in Britain and Ireland. Unionists in Ulster feared being governed from Dublin and organised armed opposition, forming the Ulster Volunteer Force. Nationalists campaigned for Home Rule and prepared their own defence groups. The crisis culminated in confrontations such as the Larne gun-running and political standoffs that showed how close Britain could come to civil conflict. These imperial and Irish issues, combined with international rivalries in Europe — naval competition and tangled alliance systems — created an unstable international context in which a regional crisis could escalate into continental war.

## The outbreak of war and early government action
When war broke out in 1914 the initial response in Britain was a mixture of patriotic enthusiasm, fear and rapid mobilisation. The government launched large recruitment campaigns that appealed to duty, honour and empire; tens of thousands volunteered in the early months, and whole communities joined together in “Pals” battalions where groups from the same town or workplace enlisted and fought together. The war also prompted swift expansion of state powers. The Defence of the Realm Act (DORA), passed in August 1914, gave ministers broad wartime powers to regulate industry, control information and limit civil liberties in the name of security. Censorship was imposed, night-time lighting restrictions and controls on alcohol were introduced, and government propaganda encouraged enlistment and public support for the war effort.

As the war developed and casualties mounted, voluntary recruitment could not supply the numbers needed. The introduction of conscription in 1916 through the Military Service Acts marked a turning point: military service became legally required for many men, though exemptions and tribunals for conscientious objectors were established. Conscription and the scale of the conflict intensified debates about citizenship, sacrifice, and the limits of state authority.

## Responses to total war: economy, society and gender
Total war transformed British society by extending state intervention into economic life and by reshaping social roles. The government created ministries to coordinate the war economy, most notably the Ministry of Munitions in 1915, and took steps to direct production, allocate labour and ensure supplies. Rationing, price controls and increased taxation were introduced to manage shortages and to finance the conflict. The war also produced a huge demand for labour, drawing women into paid work in new roles. Women worked in munitions factories, on farms with the Women’s Land Army, in transport and in auxiliary services, and many volunteered as nurses and in relief organisations. These changes challenged pre-war gender norms and strengthened arguments for political recognition.

At the same time, the human cost of war had a sharp impact on communities. The “Pals” system meant that some towns suffered disproportionately when battalions were decimated on the Western Front, creating communal grief. Conscientious objectors faced tribunals, imprisonment and social hostility if they refused military service on moral or religious grounds. Propaganda and the press played a central role in shaping public opinion, while government control of information limited open debate about the progress of the war. By 1918 the scale and endurance of the conflict had forced reassessments of state-society relations and of what citizenship and national duty meant.

## Interpretations and legacy: was this a ‘golden age’?
The interpretation of Edwardian Britain as a “golden age” rests on images of prosperity, imperial confidence and cultural achievement. Supporters of that view emphasise rising living standards for many, technological progress and the stability of institutions. Critics argue that beneath the surface lay structural problems: persistent poverty revealed by social surveys, growing political unrest, strikes and the Home Rule crisis, and deep inequalities for women and colonial subjects. The First World War is itself interpreted in contrasting ways: some see it as the great rupture that ended the old order and accelerated social change — bringing expanded state power, widened enfranchisement and altered gender relations — while others stress continuities, arguing that many pre-war structures simply adapted to wartime needs.

For students, the important point is to understand both sets of arguments and the evidence that supports them. Primary sources such as newspapers, government reports and personal letters, plus secondary interpretations, can be used to show how different historians emphasize different causes and consequences. The legacy of 1900–1918 is not a single story but a contested set of changes that reshaped Britain politically, socially and economically.

## Exam technique
To do well in exam questions on Britain in Peace and War, first be precise about the focus of the question: does it ask about social conditions, political change, attitudes to empire, or responses to war? Use relevant facts and examples to support every point: mention Rowntree’s study when discussing poverty, the People’s Budget and the 1911 Parliament Act for political crisis questions, the WSPU and hunger strikes for suffrage, and DORA, conscription and the Ministry of Munitions for wartime government action. When answering “how far” or “why” questions, plan a short structure with an introduction that outlines your judgment, two or three developed paragraphs that weigh evidence for and against, and a conclusion that reaches a balanced verdict. For interpretation questions, identify differences between provided interpretations and explain reasons for these differences using context and knowledge; mention the kind of evidence that would support or weaken each view. In source-based questions or the site study, always link the source to your own knowledge and assess utility, origin, purpose and limitation. Finally, practise timing so you can plan, write clearly and leave a few minutes to check your spelling, punctuation and specialist terms — clear expression and well-organised answers will help your historical argument score highly.
