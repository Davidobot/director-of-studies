# USA 1945–1974: Society, Rights and Dissent (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: the post‑war United States and why this period matters
The years 1945–1974 were a time of rapid change and sharp contradictions in the United States. Emerging from the Second World War as a superpower, American society experienced unprecedented economic growth, mass suburbanisation and cultural dynamism. At the same time the country faced persistent racial segregation, powerful anti‑communist sentiment and growing political turmoil at home and abroad. This combination produced two intertwined stories: one of expanding opportunity and consumer affluence, and one of conflict — over civil rights, the role of government, the Vietnam War and the rights of women and other minorities. For GCSE students this period is useful because it reveals how people and the state interacted, how protest changed public policy, and how different groups used legal, political and cultural means to claim rights.

## Post‑war America 1945–1954: prosperity, social change and the Red Scare
After 1945 the US economy moved from wartime production to sustained peacetime growth. The GI Bill enabled millions of veterans to buy homes, access higher education and enter professional careers, fuelling the growth of suburbs and a mass consumer culture. Developments such as Levittown symbolised the new suburban lifestyle, while highways, television and expanding manufacturing shaped everyday life. Yet prosperity was uneven: African Americans, many women who had done wartime work, and some immigrant and poor communities did not share fully in the new prosperity.

Fear of communism shaped politics and society in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Cold War with the Soviet Union created pressure for ideological conformity. Government measures and unofficial campaigns, often amplified by the media, targeted individuals suspected of leftwing sympathies. High‑profile cases such as the trial and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the activities of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, created a culture of suspicion that affected careers, civil liberties and public debate. The Red Scare limited political dissent and shaped attitudes towards activism; it also influenced US foreign policy, providing a context for decisions in Asia and beyond.

Racial segregation remained entrenched, especially in the South under Jim Crow laws. Although the federal government began to make small moves (for example President Truman desegregated the armed forces in 1948), the legal and social structure of segregation persisted until mass civil rights campaigns of the 1950s and 1960s. Understanding this immediate post‑war context explains why many Americans both celebrated growth and feared change.

## Civil Rights 1954–1964: legal breakthroughs, mass protest and federal response
The modern Civil Rights Movement combined legal challenges, grassroots organising and non‑violent direct action to attack segregation and secure equal rights. A turning point was the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared state school segregation unconstitutional. Brown provided a legal foundation and moral momentum that civil rights leaders used to press for wider change.

Mass campaigns brought the struggle into the national spotlight. The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–56) transformed local protest into a sustained movement and elevated Martin Luther King Jr. as a national leader using non‑violent civil disobedience. School desegregation crises such as the Little Rock Nine (1957) showed the limits of local compliance and required federal intervention, underlining how national politics could be forced to confront local resistance.

During the early 1960s black activists and NGOs developed a range of tactics. Sit‑ins and Freedom Rides challenged segregation in public spaces and interstate travel. Organised events culminating in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom (1963) combined moral pressure and careful public relations; Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” address captured the movement’s aspirations. These campaigns worked alongside legal strategies pursued by the NAACP and others, which targeted discriminatory laws and practices in courts.

Political leadership mattered. Presidents John F. Kennedy and, more decisively, Lyndon B. Johnson responded to public pressure with legislative initiatives. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination in public places and employment, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (shortly beyond the 1954–64 window but part of the same wave) tackled barriers to African American voting in the South. These laws marked a major shift in federal policy: the national government moved from occasional interventions to active enforcement of civil rights.

## Government and dissent 1964–1974: radicalism, the New Left and the politics of protest
After 1964 dissent broadened. The civil rights struggle radicalised in places, producing movements and leaders who rejected non‑violent integrationist strategies. Figures such as Malcolm X, and organisations associated with Black Power, emphasised self‑defence, racial pride and socioeconomic independence. Urban rebellions in places such as Watts (1965) and Detroit (1967) revealed deep economic and political frustrations and shifted debates about what equality meant.

The Vietnam War profoundly reshaped dissent. The escalation of US involvement after 1964 and particularly after 1965 provoked growing opposition. Student groups, notably the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), organised campus protests, teach‑ins and mass demonstrations. Media coverage, including televised images of combat and civilian suffering, helped to mobilise public opinion and increased scrutiny of government claims. The Tet Offensive of 1968 and later revelations about bombing campaigns and covert operations eroded trust in official narratives.

The Great Society programmes under Johnson attempted to address poverty, education and health through ambitious legislation such as Medicare and Medicaid and initiatives aimed at urban renewal and welfare. These reforms won support but also generated backlash from those who saw them as expanding federal power too far. President Richard Nixon’s policies combined a move to “Vietnamisation” of the war with domestic “law and order” rhetoric that appealed to disaffected white voters. Nixon’s presidency ended amid Watergate and resignation in 1974, a moment that deepened public scepticism about political leadership and accountability.

## Social and cultural change: women, youth, sexuality and new identities
The period saw major cultural transformations alongside political struggles. The rise of a youthful counterculture in the 1960s — expressed through music, communal living, new attitudes to sexuality and drug use — challenged mainstream norms. College campuses became hubs for cultural and political experimentation and for organising protest.

Women launched a powerful second wave feminist movement in the 1960s and early 1970s. Building on changing work patterns, intellectual critiques and grassroots organising, activists challenged legal and cultural inequalities. Betty Friedan’s critique of post‑war domesticity helped to spark national debate, and organisations such as the National Organization for Women campaigned for equal pay, reproductive rights and an end to employment discrimination. Legislative changes such as the Equal Pay Act (1963) and the use of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to fight sex discrimination represented important steps, while landmark cases and mobilisations around reproductive rights culminated in national debates in the early 1970s.

Gay rights and other movements also emerged into public view. The Stonewall riots of 1969 in New York are widely seen as a catalytic moment for the gay liberation movement, creating networks and public visibility that would grow during the 1970s. Indigenous, Chicano and Puerto Rican activists, and organisations representing other ethnic minorities, used demonstrations, legal strategies and cultural resurgence to demand rights, representation and economic justice.

All these changes were uneven and contested: progress in legal rights did not automatically translate into equal living conditions, and cultural changes provoked strong conservative reactions. Understanding the variety of movements and their methods is essential to explain both social progress and social conflict in this era.

## Impact and significance: how far did American society change?
By 1974 the United States had experienced substantial change in law, politics and culture. Federal civil rights legislation dismantled the legal basis for segregation; new social programmes addressed aspects of poverty and health; and the range of social movements expanded the public conversation about identity and rights. Yet significant continuities remained. Economic inequality persisted, de facto segregation continued in housing and schools, and many working‑class and rural communities felt excluded from the gains of the 1950s and 1960s. The turn to conservatism in parts of the electorate, the urban crises of the late 1960s, and the political fallout from Watergate suggest that the period’s reforms generated complex reactions as well as achievements.

For GCSE purposes it is useful to balance evidence of progress (laws, new institutions, expanded rights in principle) with evidence of limits (continued discrimination, social unrest, and backlash). Where possible, use local case studies, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Freedom Summer voter registration drives, or the Detroit riot, to show how national trends played out on the ground. This approach helps to judge the extent and depth of change, a key theme in exam questions.

## Exam technique
When answering GCSE questions on USA 1945–1974 follow a clear approach that addresses the assessment objectives. For knowledge and explanation (AO1 and AO2) be precise: place events in context and explain causes and consequences rather than simply narrating. Use second‑order concepts such as continuity and change, cause and consequence, and significance to structure argument — for example, explain why Brown v. Board was significant for legal rights but limited in immediate social effect.

When a question asks you to use sources (AO3) read them carefully, note what they say and what they do not say, and evaluate their usefulness. Consider provenance: who produced the source, when and why, and how that affects reliability. Compare sources by assessing similarities and differences in content, perspective and purpose, and use this to reach a balanced judgement. For interpretation questions (AO4) practise comparing historians’ viewpoints: summarise each interpretation, explain reasons for differences (for instance political perspective, new evidence, or later events like the Cold War), and then make a supported judgement about which is more convincing and why.

Manage your time by following the exam board’s expectations: for papers that include the period study, aim to spend roughly an hour on the period section and about 45 minutes on a non‑British depth study when that is required. For essays, open with a direct answer to the question, follow with organised paragraphs that develop the argument using specific evidence (laws, events, names, dates), and finish with a clear conclusion that weighs up the evidence. For extended responses where SPaG marks are available, ensure your writing is clear, uses specialist terms (for example “Jim Crow”, “non‑violent direct action”, “Vietnamisation”) and includes a sustained line of reasoning.

Practice past questions under timed conditions, include a mix of factual recall and interpretation work, and get feedback on source analysis and essays. Use case studies as evidence rather than description alone: explain how a case study supports your argument about national change. Finally, remember balance: examiners reward answers that show understanding of complexity — achievements and limits — and that draw on a range of evidence to reach a thoughtful judgement.
