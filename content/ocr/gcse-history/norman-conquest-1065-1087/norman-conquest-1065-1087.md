# The Norman Conquest (1065–1087) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview and significance
The Norman Conquest was a turning point in English history. Between 1065 and 1087 the kingdom of England experienced a sudden and dramatic change of leadership, followed by war, political reorganisation and social transformation. William, Duke of Normandy, invaded in 1066, won the decisive victory at the Battle of Hastings and was crowned king, but conquest was not a single event; it unfolded through campaigns, revolts and administrative measures over the following two decades. The period matters because it reshaped landholding, government, the Church and culture in England, introducing new ruling families, continental links and ideas while also preserving many earlier structures. It is therefore a powerful example for understanding continuity and change, cause and consequence, and how different kinds of evidence and interpretations shape our view of the past.

## England on the eve of conquest
Late Anglo-Saxon England at the end of Edward the Confessor’s reign was a complex, well-organised society. Power was distributed through earls and local thegns, and government was exercised by institutions such as the shire courts and the witan (council). Religion was central: the Church played both spiritual and political roles, and monasteries were important landowners. Culture included distinctive art, law and literature, and many settlements, farms and trading towns were flourishing. This was not a weak or disorganised country, but it did undergo political tensions over succession. Edward died in January 1066 leaving no direct heir, and several contenders emerged, most notably Harold Godwinson, who was chosen and crowned king, and William of Normandy, who claimed Edward had promised him the throne and asserted that Harold had sworn, while visiting Normandy, to support William’s claim. These contested claims created the crisis that set the year’s dramatic events in motion.

## Invasion and victory, 1066
1066 was a year of crisis and military action. In September Harold Godwinson secured a dramatic victory over an invasion from the north when he defeated the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada and Harold’s own brother Tostig at Stamford Bridge. Almost immediately afterwards Harold had to march south to face William of Normandy. William’s claim to the throne was backed by Norman military resources and papal support; his army contained cavalry, archers and disciplined infantry and he fought with a clear strategy. The two forces met on 14 October 1066 at the Battle of Hastings. The battle was hard-fought and ended with Harold’s death and the collapse of the Anglo-Saxon field army. Accounts of Harold’s death vary, with later tradition claiming he was struck by an arrow, but what matters for students to note is that the loss of the king and the army enabled William to consolidate power and march towards London. He was crowned on Christmas Day 1066, an act that symbolised his claim to legitimate kingship and the beginning of Norman rule.

## Resistance and consolidation, 1067–1071
William’s victory at Hastings did not end opposition. From 1067 onwards a series of uprisings, often led by surviving members of the Anglo-Saxon elite or by local leaders, challenged Norman authority. Rebellions occurred in regions such as the West and Mercia, and key figures such as Edwin and Morcar initially resisted Norman control. The north of England proved particularly troublesome. In 1069 a major uprising coincided with a Viking raid, and William’s response was severe. The so-called “Harrying of the North” in 1069–70 involved the devastation of large areas, the burning of villages and crops, and the killing and displacement of many people; contemporary and later sources describe widespread famine and depopulation. In the fenlands the resistance led by figures such as Hereward the Wake continued into the early 1070s, showing that control in some places was contested for years. William’s military campaigns, combined with negotiated settlements, the replacement of leading English landowners and the construction of fortifications, gradually reduced resistance and established Norman rule by about 1071.

## Castles: fortification, administration and symbolism
One of the most visible changes after 1066 was the rapid building of castles. The Normans introduced motte-and-bailey designs on a large scale and also began to construct stone keeps at key points. Castles served military purposes, providing a defensive base and a place from which to control the surrounding countryside. They allowed small garrisons to hold territory and to respond quickly to unrest. Castles were also administrative centres where the new Norman lords established manorial control, collected taxes and dispensed justice. Beyond their practical uses, castles were powerful symbols of authority and foreign domination. The Tower of London is one such example, begun by William’s followers and later expanded to underline royal presence in the capital. When teaching about castles, emphasise their multiple functions: military, administrative, economic and symbolic, and consider how archaeological remains and contemporary accounts can be used as evidence.

## Conquest and control: society, the Church and Domesday
By 1086 English society had undergone significant change, though there was also continuity. The native aristocracy had been largely replaced at the top by a new Norman elite: landholding was redistributed to William’s followers, and the feudal system became more formalised with tenants-in-chief holding land from the king. The Domesday Book of 1086 is a crucial source for this transformation. Commissioned to assess landholding and resources, Domesday records who owned what and provides evidence of the scale of land transfer to Norman lords. It is also a tax and administrative record, showing the crown’s interest in control and revenue. The Church was reformed under Norman influence with the appointment of continental bishops such as Lanfranc to Canterbury, the replacement of some English clergy and the introduction of Norman ecclesiastical practices and monastic reforms. Yet many local structures, laws and rural communities continued much as before; ordinary people often experienced continuity in their daily lives even as the elite changed. Language changed at court and in administration as Norman French and Latin became important, but Old English remained the language of the majority.

## Sources and interpretations: the Norman Yoke and beyond
Understanding the Norman Conquest depends on interpreting diverse sources and recognising their limits. Key sources include chronicles such as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Norman accounts like William of Poitiers and Orderic Vitalis, and visual evidence such as the Bayeux Tapestry. Each source has its own perspective and purpose: Norman writers tended to justify William’s actions and present him as rightful king, while English sources may emphasise suffering and loss. The idea of the “Norman Yoke” emerged later as a theme portraying Norman rule as oppressive and alien, used by some medieval and much later writers to explain social hardship and to criticise aristocratic power. Modern historians debate the extent to which the Conquest was transformative versus continuity-oriented. Some stress the dramatic nature of elite replacement and legal changes; others highlight persistence in local government, agriculture and daily life. Teaching this topic offers an excellent opportunity to explore how historians build interpretations from evidence, how the choice of sources and the historian’s own context shape conclusions, and how to evaluate competing views.

## Teaching approaches and classroom activities
A helpful teaching approach is to move from concrete evidence to broader interpretation. Start with sources that students can examine directly: use an extract from the Domesday Book to practise source utility questions, study panels of the Bayeux Tapestry to discuss propaganda and audience, and compare English and Norman chronicle accounts of a single event such as Hastings. Encourage students to place sources in context by asking who created them, when and why, and what they leave out. Timeline activities that follow 1066–1071 help learners understand the sequence of events and the relationship between battles, rebellions and administrative change. Case studies such as the Harrying of the North or the building of a particular castle can make local impacts visible and enable students to weigh evidence for the scale of devastation or the pace of consolidation. When planning lessons, balance narrative (what happened) with enquiry tasks (why it happened and how we know), and model how to write an argument using specific evidence from primary sources and historical interpretations.

## Exam technique
Answering exam questions on the Norman Conquest requires both secure knowledge and careful use of evidence. For source-based tasks, start by reading the source twice, noting its content, tone and any obvious features. Explain what the source says and then use your contextual knowledge to show why it says that and how reliable it is. When asked what further evidence you would use, name specific kinds of sources such as Domesday entries, charter evidence, archaeological reports of castle sites, or other chronicles, and explain how each would help answer the question. For interpretation questions, identify the main point of each interpretation, explore areas of agreement and difference, and explain why differences exist by considering authorship, date, purpose and evidence. In essays that ask “How far do you agree?” structure your answer with a clear introduction stating your overall judgement, body paragraphs that set out reasons with evidence and counter-arguments, and a concise conclusion that returns to the question. Use second-order concepts like cause, consequence, continuity and change explicitly to organise your analysis. Always support assertions with specific examples: names, dates, events and sources matter. Manage your time so that you plan briefly, write clearly and leave a few minutes to check spelling, grammar and specialist terms. Practise past-style questions under timed conditions, and when possible rehearse writing short source evaluations and comparative paragraphs, since these skills match the assessment objectives for the depth study.
