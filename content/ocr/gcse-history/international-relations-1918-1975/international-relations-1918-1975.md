# International Relations 1918–1975 (Period study) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What this period study covers and why it matters
The period 1918–1975 is a central thread in modern world history. It begins with the aftermath of the First World War and the fragile hopes for a new international order and finishes in the mid-1970s when the Cold War system had settled into a pattern of superpower rivalry, periodic confrontation and limited cooperation. Studying this period helps you understand the rise and fall of states and ideologies, how great‑power competition shaped smaller countries, and why interpretations of events (for example, appeasement or who caused the Cold War) have changed over time. For GCSE purposes you will be expected to build a clear narrative of the key developments, to explain and analyse causes and consequences, to use source evidence to support judgements, and to evaluate interpretations. This combination of narrative, analysis and source work trains the skills historians use: factual knowledge, second‑order concepts such as continuity and change, and a critical approach to evidence and interpretation.

## Conflict and co‑operation, 1918–1939: the fragile peace
The immediate post‑war years saw intense debate about how to make peace lasting. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) and the creation of the League of Nations were central to efforts to create a new international order based on collective security and law. Students should be able to explain what the Versailles settlement aimed to achieve and how its terms—territorial changes, reparations and the new map of Europe—left unresolved problems that generated resentment in the defeated states and uncertainty elsewhere. The League had early successes in the 1920s promoting arbitration and international agreements such as the Dawes Plan (1924), Locarno (1925) and the Kellogg‑Briand Pact (1928), and it encouraged a short period of co‑operation. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Global Depression, however, weakened democracies and strengthened extremist and authoritarian movements. The 1930s saw the retreat to nationalism: aggressive revisionist policies by Italy, Japan and Germany, the failure of collective security when the League could not prevent aggression in Manchuria (1931) and Abyssinia (1935–36), and the policy of appeasement by Britain and France, culminating in Munich 1938 and the outbreak of war in 1939. In this section you should link events to consequences: how economic crisis undermined diplomacy, how the weakness of international institutions encouraged power politics, and how public opinion and domestic politics constrained states’ foreign policy choices.

## The Cold War in Europe, 1945–1961: division and alliance
After 1945 the wartime alliance between the USSR and the Western powers fractured quickly as wartime cooperation gave way to suspicion over the future of liberated Europe. Conferences at Yalta and Potsdam (1945) set the immediate post‑war arrangements, but differences over Eastern Europe, reparations and political systems created deep tensions. The division of Germany became a physical and symbolic focus of that rivalry. US policy shifted towards containment: the Truman Doctrine (1947) offered aid to resist Soviet influence, and the Marshall Plan (1948) provided economic recovery aid to Western Europe, strengthening political stability and making clear the economic as well as the strategic dimension of Cold War policy. The Berlin Blockade (1948–49) and the successful airlift underlined the stakes and led to the formal organisation of alliances: NATO (1949) in the West and, later, the Warsaw Pact (1955) in the East. The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 became the most visible symbol of the Iron Curtain. In answering exam questions you should be prepared to explain the causes of the division, the development of alliances, and how these political and military structures affected people in Europe, from displaced persons to those living under occupation.

## Cold War confrontations and conflicts, 1954–1975
This phase shows how global rivalry often took the form of crises and proxy wars rather than full‑scale direct conflict between the superpowers. The Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) brought the world perilously close to nuclear war and demonstrated the dangers of brinkmanship but also the capacity for crisis management once both sides accepted the need for careful negotiation. The origins and expansion of US involvement in Vietnam began in the aftermath of French defeat at Dien Bien Phu (1954) and escalated after the Gulf of Tonkin incident (1964), leading to a protracted conflict with major consequences for US domestic politics and international perceptions of American power. The Vietnam War illustrated limits of military power, the role of ideology, and how domestic opposition (protests, political divisions) could force a superpower to withdraw. By 1975, with the fall of Saigon, the period closed with the appearance of a more complex global order: détente between the USSR and the USA in the early 1970s, the strategic arms limitation talks, and continuing regional conflicts shaped by the Cold War context. For revision, focus on how each confrontation changed international relations, affected civilian populations, and influenced Western and Soviet policies.

## Historical controversy and interpreting the period
A key part of the course is the study of historical controversy: why historians disagree, how interpretations develop, and how new evidence changes judgements. Two major controversies in this period are interpretations of appeasement in the 1930s and explanations of responsibility for the Cold War. Appeasement was long condemned as a policy of weakness that enabled Nazi expansion; later historians argued it was a pragmatic response to public opinion, economic limits and the trauma of 1914–18. More recent work emphasises the complexity of decision‑making and the range of options available to leaders. Similarly, responsibility for the Cold War has been viewed through several lenses: traditionalist interpretations place the blame largely on Soviet expansionism; revisionists have argued that US economic and diplomatic policies helped provoke tensions; post‑revisionists emphasise a mutual misperception and structural pressures. The opening of Soviet archives from the 1990s added evidence that has refined these positions but not ended the debate. When you answer questions on interpretations, practise identifying the author, the date, the purpose and the tone of an interpretation, then compare it with what you know from contemporary sources and broader context. That method lets you explain why interpretations differ and judge which are most convincing.

## How this period study links with depth studies, sources and synoptic skills
This period study is designed to be synoptic: it links to non‑British depth studies that look at the relationship between people and the state in particular countries and to British thematic studies that explore long‑term changes. Use these links to deepen understanding. For example, if your depth study is Germany 1925–1955, use your knowledge of appeasement and the 1930s to explain how international developments influenced domestic politics and vice versa. Sources are central: you will be expected to analyse contemporary documents (speeches, government papers, press reports) for their provenance, purpose and value, and to compare them. Practise using sources together with your factual knowledge: show how a source supports or contradicts wider evidence, and consider limitations such as bias or censorship. Also practise using second‑order concepts—cause, consequence, continuity, change and significance—across different parts of the course so that you can write essays that move beyond description to explanation and judgement. Remember that paper questions are designed to test a mix of these skills, so your revision should combine timelines and factual recall with interpretation practice and source analysis.

## Exam technique
Time management and clear, focused answers make the difference in the exam. For the period study section you will normally have about one hour; spend time at the start to read the questions carefully and plan short answers where required and a longer plan for any essay. For short “outline” or “describe” questions aim for a sharp paragraph that covers sequence and key points; for “explain” questions show cause and consequence and link facts to argument. When you are given interpretations to compare or evaluate, first identify who produced them, when and why, then use specific knowledge to test their claims. Don’t treat interpretations as isolated statements: place them alongside contemporary sources and your factual knowledge to say which interpretation is more convincing and why. The extended essay question is worth the most marks and includes SPaG marks, so plan a clear introduction that sets out your argument, develop two or three well‑supported points with evidence, show understanding of continuity and change where relevant, and end with a reasoned conclusion that evaluates the issue. Practice under timed conditions, annotate sources quickly for provenance and reliability, and learn key dates and concepts so you can use them to strengthen judgements. Finally, always answer the question set, not a question you would prefer to answer; precision and relevance win marks.
