# People’s Health (c.1250–present) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why this theme matters
People’s health is a thematic study that follows how living conditions, disease and public responses have changed in Britain from around 1250 to the present. Studying health over this long sweep gives you a powerful way to connect the past with the present: many debates you hear about today — about the role of government, the importance of science, or the impact of poverty on life chances — have deep roots. The topic asks you to think about three consistent issues across the centuries: how living conditions affected health, how societies responded to epidemics, and how people attempted to improve public health. By looking at these issues across four broad periods you will build a strong sense of continuity and change and be able to assess the reasons for improvement or decline in people’s health.

## Key themes and what you must be able to do
Throughout the course you will be expected to identify the main features of each period, explain causes and consequences, and make links between periods. You should be able to describe people’s daily lives — what they ate, how they lived, where they worked — and how those things affected their vulnerability to disease. You must also be able to explain the range of responses to outbreaks, from popular beliefs and religious interpretations to official measures and medical interventions. Finally, you should be able to discuss attempts to improve public health: proposals, laws and local initiatives, and why these sometimes succeeded and sometimes failed. Always use specific examples from the periods you study to support your explanations and judgements.

## Five factors that shape change and continuity
To structure answers it helps to think about five factors that repeatedly influenced public health: beliefs, attitudes and values; local and national government; science and technology; urbanisation; and wealth and poverty. Beliefs shaped explanations for disease; for much of the medieval and early modern periods people explained illness in religious or moral terms and accepted supernatural causes or God’s punishment. Government action appeared slowly: local communities and guilds often handled sanitation in medieval towns, while national measures became more visible from the Tudor era and then much stronger in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Science and technology made a decisive difference: improvements in water supply, drainage and medical knowledge — especially after germ theory became accepted — transformed public health. Urbanisation concentrated people into towns and cities where poor housing, overcrowding and inadequate waste disposal created fertile conditions for epidemics. Finally, wealth and poverty were central: well-off people could escape contagion more easily, while the poor paid the highest price for urban squalor and inadequate diets. Using these factors to structure answers will help you explain why things changed at particular moments.

## Medieval Britain, c.1250–c.1500: living with disease
Medieval Britain was predominantly rural, but growing towns meant new public health challenges. Housing was often damp and overcrowded, diets could be poor and inconsistent, and clean water and waste disposal were basic by modern standards. Medical knowledge was a mixture of classical ideas, folk remedies and religious healing. Monasteries and hospitals run by the Church provided a degree of care and cleanliness for some people; they were the main organised centres of care in many towns. The Black Death of the mid-fourteenth century (1348–49) was the defining crisis: it killed an enormous percentage of the population, caused social and economic upheaval, and led to a range of popular and official responses. People explained the plague in religious terms, blamed unusual alignments of the planets, or pointed to bad air (miasma). Responses included flight from affected areas, quarantine of houses, prayers and processions, and attempts at rudimentary sanitation in towns. The experience of the Black Death also changed labour relations and had long-term social and economic consequences that affected living conditions and therefore health.

## Early Modern Britain, c.1500–c.1750: plague, order and the gin craze
The early modern period saw population growth, the expansion of towns and new pressures on public health. Housing and water systems in growing urban centres still lagged behind needs, and outbreaks of plague continued to terrorise communities. From the late sixteenth century governments began to take more formal steps: national plague orders and local regulations attempted to control movement, isolate the infected and manage burial. These orders show the first consistent intervention by national and local authorities in public health. At the same time cultural and economic changes brought new problems. The gin craze of the later seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries led to concern about the moral and physical effects of cheap spirit consumption among the urban poor. The government response to this crisis culminated in the Gin Act 1751, which aimed to reduce consumption through licensing and taxation. Throughout the period, miasma remained a dominant explanation for disease, and while some local improvements in urban sanitation occurred, lasting structural improvements were limited until the industrial era.

## Industrial Britain, c.1750–c.1900: cholera, reform and the rise of public health
Industrialisation transformed Britain’s towns and cities. Rapid urban growth created overcrowded slums, inadequate housing and unsanitary streets. These conditions contributed to repeated cholera epidemics in the nineteenth century, notably in 1832, 1848–49 and 1854. Cholera provoked an important debate: many authorities accepted miasma as the cause, while others, most famously John Snow in 1854, produced evidence that contaminated water was the key factor. Snow’s investigation of the Broad Street pump in London was a milestone: it showed how careful use of local evidence and logical argument could challenge received wisdom and point the way to improvements in water and sewage. Campaigning by reformers such as Edwin Chadwick, whose 1842 report on the sanitary conditions of the labouring population argued that disease and poverty were linked, and public revulsion at events like the Great Stink of 1858, persuaded governments and local authorities to act. Joseph Bazalgette’s construction of a modern sewer system in London, the passage of the 1848 Public Health Act and the 1875 Public Health Act (which consolidated sanitary law and gave local authorities stronger powers) mark the emergence of modern municipal public health. Science moved forward too: by the late nineteenth century germ theory, promoted by Pasteur and Koch, began to displace miasma and gave a clearer scientific basis for interventions.

## Britain since c.1900: universal provision, new threats and public health campaigns
The twentieth century brought major changes in government responsibility for health. The experience of two world wars showed the importance of organised medical services, and the foundation of the National Health Service in 1948 established free, universal healthcare as a central part of British life. Medical advances transformed treatment: the mass use of antibiotics after the 1940s, the development of vaccines and improvements in obstetric care all reduced mortality. New threats continued to arise: the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918–1919 caused massive loss of life and revealed the limits of early twentieth-century public health systems. From the 1980s AIDS presented a different kind of public health challenge: an illness with significant social stigma that required careful public information campaigns and targeted services. Environmental and lifestyle issues have become increasingly important in recent decades. Air pollution led to the 1956 Clean Air Act after the deadly London smog of 1952, and evidence linking smoking to lung cancer from mid-twentieth-century studies produced anti-smoking campaigns, advertising restrictions and later smoking bans in public places. Government health promotion has expanded to include campaigns against obesity, the encouragement of exercise and measures to control pollution. These later developments show that public health is not only about preventing infectious disease but also about managing longer-term threats linked to behaviour, environment and inequality.

## Connecting evidence and interpretations
When you study people’s health, historians use a range of sources and interpretations. Contemporary sources include parish records, hospital accounts, medical pamphlets, governmental reports (for example Chadwick’s report), newspaper coverage and maps or plans of towns. Material evidence such as the remains of sewers, hospitals and workhouses also helps historians understand living conditions. Interpretations have changed over time: nineteenth-century commentators often blamed the poor for their own condition; social reformers highlighted structural causes; twentieth-century historians have explored the role of science and the state. When you are asked to explain change or evaluate a view, draw on both types of evidence. Use specific examples to show how an interpretation is supported or challenged by sources: for example, show how the Great Stink both provoked public disgust and gave political momentum to Bazalgette’s sewer scheme, or how John Snow’s use of local evidence challenged miasma-based interpretations of cholera.

## Exam technique
Approach the thematic questions by organising your answer around the second-order concepts the exam expects: change and continuity, cause and consequence, significance. For a summary question, create a clear, chronological account that focuses on the issue in the question and links developments across the periods you have studied. For explanation questions, begin with a clear judgement, then support it with several well-developed paragraphs that each focus on a single factor (for example, government action, scientific knowledge, urbanisation), using specific examples and dates. When you face a “how far” or interpretation question, start by restating the claim in your own words, then compare the strengths and limitations of the interpretation using evidence. To reach a balanced judgement, consider counter-evidence and explain why one view is more convincing. Always use precise examples: name the Black Death (1348–49), John Snow and the Broad Street pump (1854), Bazalgette’s sewers and the Great Stink (1858), the 1875 Public Health Act, the 1918 influenza pandemic, the creation of the NHS (1948), and anti-smoking campaigns and Clean Air legislation in the mid‑to‑late twentieth century. In longer answers show connections across periods: explain continuity (for example, persistent links between poverty and poor health) and change (for example, the shift from miasma to germ theory and the rise of state responsibility). Write clearly, include dates or period terms where appropriate, and end with a short conclusion that answers the question directly. This disciplined structure will help you communicate knowledge, analyse causes and reach a well-supported judgment.
