# History Around Us — Site Study (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction to the site study
The History Around Us site study is one of the five equal elements of OCR’s History B (SHP) GCSE (J411). It is a distinctive part of the course because it asks you to work with the physical remains of a real place and to use those remains, together with other sources, to build historical understanding. Worth 20% of the GCSE, the component is assessed in a separate one‑hour exam (40 marks) with a further 10 marks available for spelling, punctuation, grammar and specialist terminology (SPaG). The exam tests your ability to interpret what survives at the site, to place the site in its wider historical context, and to evaluate both the strengths and limitations of the physical evidence. Centres choose the site to be studied, but OCR must approve it before teaching begins, and learners must name the site at the start of each answer in the exam.

## Why the historic environment matters
Studying a historic site brings history to life. The physical remains of a place—walls, earthworks, buildings, foundations, layout and landscape—offer direct, tangible evidence of past human activity and choices. Working with such evidence trains you to think like a historian: to observe closely, ask precise questions, weigh different kinds of evidence, and build interpretations that account for both what survives and what is missing. A site study also helps you connect local places and people with wider historical processes: changing economy and technology, shifting patterns of settlement, religious change, war, commemoration and conservation. Whether your site is a medieval parish church, an industrial factory, an Iron Age hillfort, an abandoned Second World War airfield or a town centre, the physical remains can reveal everyday life, power, belief and change over time.

## Choosing a site and getting approval
Centres may choose any site that allows pupils to meet the specification’s learning aims, but the chosen place must support a full learning programme and be submitted to OCR for approval using the History Around Us Site Proposal Form. That form should explain clearly how the site meets the assessment criteria and should include appropriate images and maps. OCR asks centres to submit the form by the published deadline (normally 31 January in the year of entry) and to wait for confirmation of approval before teaching the component. Approved sites remain on file for the lifetime of the specification unless the centre changes them. When choosing a site you should consider accessibility for learners, the range of surviving features, opportunities to collect contextual material (documents, maps, pictures, oral history) and whether the site can be treated in ways that avoid overlap with other GCSE topics the centre is teaching.

## What you must study at the site
The specification expects you to use the physical features of the chosen site as the main evidence while also drawing on other supporting sources to provide context. Teaching and learning should address a range of interlinked questions that historians ask about places. You will need to account for why the site is where it is, when and why people first created it, and how it has changed in form and use over time. You must investigate the variety of activities and people associated with the site and identify significant moments in its history—times of peak activity, turning points and decline. It is essential to explain the reasons behind changes to the site and to assess the significance of specific physical features: why an earthwork, dock, kiln, nave or defensive bank mattered in a particular period. You should also place the site in a wider context by judging its local or national importance and by comparing it, where appropriate, with other similar sites to test how typical it is. Finally, good study considers what the site reveals about everyday life, attitudes and values in particular periods, how physical remains prompt historically valid questions and how such remains feed into artistic reconstructions and public interpretations. Throughout your work you should be aware of the challenges of studying the historic environment—conservation, later alteration, incomplete survival, and modern interpretation—and the educational benefits these places offer.

## Using the evidence: physical remains and supporting sources
Physical remains are powerful because they are primary evidence you can examine directly, but they also have limits. Stonework, earthworks, foundations, surviving buildings, layout and landscape features provide material traces that suggest use, wealth, technology and priorities. At the same time a single stone wall or truncated foundation can be ambiguous: it may have been reused, repaired, or rebuilt, and it often needs documentary, cartographic, pictorial or archaeological context to be properly understood. Supporting sources—local records, maps, photographs, excavation reports, objects, oral testimony and secondary accounts—help to fill gaps, date features, explain function and reveal people’s intentions and experiences. In the exam you will be expected to combine close analysis of physical features with well‑chosen contextual knowledge. That means you should routinely practise describing and interpreting features on site visits, annotating photographs and sketch plans, comparing the surviving fabric with historical descriptions, and testing tentative conclusions against documentary evidence.

## Fieldwork, practicalities and classroom strategies
Fieldwork is strongly recommended because working on site gives you direct contact with the evidence, but it is not mandatory. If a visit is difficult, detailed photographic records, measured plans, aerial images or virtual tours may substitute. For large or complex sites it is acceptable to focus on one coherent part of the site—for example the nave of a church, a surviving industrial building, a fort’s gatehouse or a single stand at an airbase—provided that this focus still allows you to address the full range of assessment expectations. When planning visits, teachers should ensure that pupils are introduced to safe and ethical approaches to recording evidence: careful observation, measured sketches, annotated photos, and clear records of provenance for any supporting documents. Classroom tasks that build exam skills include practice essays, timed source‑use tasks in which pupils must combine features and context, and group enquiries that model how historians ask and pursue questions about cause, change and significance. Centres should also keep the site proposal documentation up to date and provide learners with a clear record of the site’s history, annotated images and guided notes so pupils can revise effectively for the exam.

## Assessment and what the exam tests
The History Around Us component is assessed by a single external paper in which learners choose two questions from a set (usually three). The exam will always require you to state the name of the site at the start of each answer and will instruct you to use physical features as well as your own knowledge to support your answers. Questions are drawn from the range of criteria set out in the specification, so you should expect to be asked to explain why the site is located where it is, to show how it changed and was used over time, to assess the importance of particular features, to judge the site’s typicality and significance, and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the physical evidence. The paper is designed to reward historical knowledge, clear organisation and the ability to use material evidence constructively. Ten additional marks are awarded for SPaG; these are given for accurate written expression and the correct use of specialist historical terms. In the exam you should therefore use dates and period terms where appropriate, write in full sentences, and make explicit connections between the features you describe and the historical conclusions you draw.

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
Students often fall into several predictable problems. One is an over‑reliance on description without interpretation: listing features of a building or landscape is not enough unless you explain what those features tell you about use, status or change. Another is failure to show period awareness; answers that mention features without placing them in time lose marks, so always date the part of the site you discuss. A third pitfall is treating the site in isolation: exam answers must combine physical analysis with relevant contextual knowledge and, where useful, comparative judgement. Finally, many learners forget to evaluate the evidence’s limitations; an answer that recognises what the remains cannot show, and suggests how other sources might fill that gap, will score highly. Regular practice writing under timed conditions, explicit SPaG revision and teacher feedback focused on argument and source use will remove these problems.

## Exam technique
Begin the exam by writing the full, correct name of the site at the top of each answer. Read all the question choices carefully and pick the two that best allow you to use your strongest knowledge and the clearest physical evidence. Plan each answer briefly: note the period(s) you will discuss, the physical features you will use as evidence, and two or three contextual points that explain change, function or significance. When you describe physical features, be precise—identify materials, construction, layout or landscape relationship—and immediately connect description to interpretation: explain what the feature suggests about people, activity or date. Where a question asks for significance or typicality, compare the site with at least one other similar site or with general patterns in the period you have studied. Always indicate chronology clearly, using dates, century terms or phrases such as “in the late medieval period” or “after the Second World War.” When evaluating the evidence, balance strengths and weaknesses: explain why a surviving wall or earthwork is useful but also why later rebuilding, erosion or modern conservation might mislead historians. Conclude each answer with a concise judgement that addresses the question directly: summarise the balance of evidence and state your final view. For SPaG marks, use specialist terms (for example nave, motte, bailey, hearth, quay, hangar, earthwork, tax rolls, enclosure) appropriately, check spelling of key historical words, punctuate sentences clearly and aim for accurate grammar. Time management is crucial: spend the first few minutes planning each answer, leave a short minute at the end to proofread and add dates or specialist terms, and avoid rewriting large sections. Practising this sequence in mock papers will build the fluency you need on the day.
