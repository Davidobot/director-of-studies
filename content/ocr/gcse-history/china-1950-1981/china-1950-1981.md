# China 1950–1981: The People and the State (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: scope and purpose of the depth study
This depth study looks at the relationship between the Chinese people and the Communist state between 1950 and 1981, a period that moves from revolutionary consolidation to mass campaigns and then to the beginnings of reform. It is intended to help you understand how state policies affected ordinary people, how different social groups responded, and how historians use evidence to weigh competing interpretations. The period includes the early years of Communist rule, the large-scale economic and social initiatives of the 1950s and 1960s, the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, and the initial shift towards pragmatic reform after Mao’s death. Throughout the unit you should link government aims and methods to their practical effects on peasants, workers, intellectuals, women, ethnic minorities and youth, and you should be ready to use case studies — such as the land reform campaigns, the communes and the Dazhai model, the Red Guards, and the Democracy Wall — to illustrate wider trends.

## Establishing Communism, 1950–1965
After 1949 the Communist Party set out to secure control and transform society. Land reform redistributed land from landlords to peasants, often through violent local struggle, and removed a traditional rural elite. The new government launched the First Five Year Plan (1953–57), borrowing Soviet-style central planning and focusing on rapid industrialisation and heavy industry while also building state control over key sectors. In the mid-1950s the Hundred Flowers campaign invited criticism of the Party but was followed by a sharp reversal in the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957, which suppressed critics and silenced dissent. Collectivisation gathered pace after 1955 and culminated in the formation of people’s communes from 1958, combining agricultural and industrial tasks on a mass scale. These measures transformed rural life by reorganising production, redistributing labour and changing village social structures, but they also increased the reach of the state into everyday routines and obligations.

## The Great Leap Forward and its consequences
The Great Leap Forward, launched in 1958, sought to accelerate industrial and agricultural output by mobilising millions in communal projects and small-scale industry such as backyard furnaces. It was driven by a mixture of ideological zeal and the desire to modernise rapidly without Soviet assistance. The policy produced chaotic implementation, exaggerated production reports, and disruption of agricultural routines. Between 1959 and 1961 China experienced a catastrophic decline in food availability. The reasons for this disaster remain debated among historians, but most agree that policy decisions — including forced collectivisation, unrealistic production targets, and the diversion of labour to unrealistically rapid industrial projects — played a central role alongside adverse weather in some regions. The human cost was severe: millions suffered hunger and starvation, and this crisis undermined the Party’s claims of infallibility and sowed distrust in local and central leadership.

## The Cultural Revolution, 1966–1976
The Cultural Revolution was a decade of political campaign, social upheaval and cultural destruction that had a profound effect on education, intellectual life and social order. Initiated by Mao to reassert his authority and to combat what he called bourgeois and revisionist tendencies, the movement encouraged students and young people to form Red Guard groups and to confront perceived enemies of the revolution. Schools and universities closed for long periods; intellectuals, officials and many ordinary people were publicly humiliated, persecuted or sent to the countryside for “re-education”; and cultural artefacts, temples and libraries were destroyed. The Party itself fractured into rival groupings; key leaders such as Liu Shaoqi were purged, and the power struggles involved military figures and later the Gang of Four. The Cultural Revolution’s impact was uneven across the country: urban centres saw dramatic political spectacle and violence, while rural areas experienced both upheaval and, in some cases, the reinforcement of local revolutionary mobilisations. The decade left lasting trauma, disrupted a generation’s education, and created contentious legacies that shaped China’s later course.

## After Mao: 1976–1981 and the beginning of reform
Mao’s death in 1976 produced an immediate political shift. The arrest of the Gang of Four marked an attempt to end the Cultural Revolution and to restore order. By 1978–79 Deng Xiaoping emerged as the dominant leader and introduced practical policies that began to dismantle the most extreme elements of Maoist mass campaigns. Deng emphasised economic modernisation and pragmatic policies, summed up in the Four Modernisations which targeted agriculture, industry, science and defence. Reforms included moves towards the household responsibility system in agricultural areas, allowing households to contract land and keep surplus production, and the opening of China to foreign technology and investment. At the same time the state reasserted political control: the brief period of open criticism in the Democracy Wall movement after 1978, where activists called for political reform, was met with repression when the Party deemed the dissent a threat. Population policy also changed with the introduction of the One Child policy around 1979 as a response to demographic concerns, though implementation varied between urban and rural areas. By 1981 China had begun a cautious transition from revolutionary mass campaigns to state-directed economic reform, setting the scene for the dramatic transformations of later decades.

## Everyday life, social groups and state policy
Understanding China 1950–1981 requires attention to how different groups experienced the state. Women were officially promoted as equal participants through policies encouraging work outside the home and legal changes such as the Marriage Law, yet traditional practices and economic realities often limited the extent of change. Young people were central to mass campaigns, first as recruits for revolutionary activity and later as victims of disrupted education. Intellectuals faced cycles of support and persecution, from praise in the early 1950s to repression during Anti-Rightist campaigns and the Cultural Revolution. Ethnic minorities, most notably Tibetans, experienced forceful integration and resistance: the 1959 uprising and the Dalai Lama’s exile are crucial episodes that illustrate the tensions between national unity and local autonomy. Propaganda was a constant feature of life: posters, songs, newspapers and model communes like Dazhai were used to project Party aims and to create a shared revolutionary culture, but they often masked local hardship and uneven outcomes. To explain the period you should always link policies to social effects and consider local case studies alongside national narratives.

## Sources, interpretations and historical debate
This depth study requires you to use a range of source material and to be aware that historians disagree about causes and responsibilities. Primary sources include official Party documents, speeches, posters and statistical releases; personal testimonies, memoirs and oral histories; foreign diplomatic reports and journalism; and physical evidence such as village records or architectural changes. Each kind of source has strengths and weaknesses: official documents show what the state claimed or intended but may obscure failures; memoirs reveal personal experience but can be selective or shaped by later politics; foreign accounts may be informative but limited by access and perspective. Interpretations have shifted over time. During the 1960s and 1970s official narratives blamed “rightists” or foreign enemies, while later scholarship has explored structural causes, local agency and the interaction between policy and environment. After the opening up of China in the 1980s and the release of more personal accounts, historians have debated, for example, how much responsibility Mao personally bears for the Great Leap Forward famine, or whether the Cultural Revolution was primarily a top-down power struggle or a mass movement with grassroots aspects. Being able to explain differing interpretations, weigh the evidence, and argue which interpretation you find most convincing is central to success in this paper.

## Exam technique
Approach each question with a clear plan and use specific factual detail to support your argument. For knowledge and explanation questions, structure answers chronologically or thematically and link causes to consequences rather than listing events. When working with sources, assess provenance as well as content: ask who produced the source, when and why, and how that affects its reliability and usefulness. In source comparison questions identify both similarities and differences, explain reasons for these, and consider omissions as well as what is present. For interpretation essays, show that you understand more than one viewpoint: outline contrasting interpretations, evaluate the evidence for each, and reach a reasoned judgement supported by examples such as land reform campaigns, the Great Leap Forward, or the Cultural Revolution. Use named case studies (for example Dazhai, the Hundred Flowers/Anti-Rightist episode, the Red Guards, or the Democracy Wall) to add precision and depth. Manage your time so you can plan, write and, if possible, revise each answer; practice writing essays under timed conditions. Finally, remember to use accurate specialist terms where appropriate, and aim for clear expression and correct spelling, punctuation and grammar — these elements are assessed and help make your argument convincing.
