# South Africa 1960–1994: Apartheid and Resistance (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: the nature and aims of Apartheid and the period 1960–1994
Apartheid was a system of racial segregation and white minority rule formally introduced after 1948 but consolidated and adapted through the 1960s to the 1980s. Its stated aim was “separate development”: the restriction of social, political and economic rights for the non-white majority and the construction of a political order in which power remained in white hands. Laws determined where people could live and work, who could vote, which schools children attended and which public facilities were available to whom. The period 1960–1994 traces the arc from the Sharpeville Massacre and the banning of major resistance organisations, through decades of repression, to a rising domestic and international resistance movement, the weakening of the apartheid state and the negotiated transition that culminated in South Africa’s first universal suffrage election in 1994. Understanding this period means looking at how the state acted to preserve power, how different groups resisted, and why momentous change occurred when it did.

## The consolidation of Apartheid: policies, institutions and Bantustans
After Sharpeville in 1960 the apartheid state intensified its control. Legislation and bureaucratic systems enforced racial classification, residential segregation and pass laws that controlled movement and labour. The government developed the Bantustan policy, creating so-called “homelands” for black South Africans. These Bantustans were designed to deny black people citizenship in South Africa, justify the removal of populations from urban areas and support a narrative that black people belonged to separate nation-states. In reality most Bantustans were economically dependent, territorially fragmented and lacking in resources. The state also expanded security institutions: the police, intelligence services and a growing military role in internal security. Economic and social measures—job reservation, inferior schooling and restricted access to services—consolidated patterns of inequality. For many white South Africans the system was presented as necessary for order and stability; for the black majority it was experienced as dispossession, control and humiliation. The state’s “total strategy” from the late 1970s and 1980s sought to combine repression, reform and propaganda to contain opposition, but it deepened conflicts and cost the regime legitimacy.

## Sharpeville, the banning of organisations and the turn to armed struggle
The Sharpeville Massacre of March 1960, when police shot demonstrators protesting pass laws and killed 69 people, was a turning point. It led to mass protests and international condemnation and prompted the apartheid government to ban the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). Faced with the removal of legal political channels, leaders within the ANC formed Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) in 1961, adopting sabotage and guerrilla tactics against state infrastructure as a form of armed struggle. The PAC’s armed wing, Poqo, pursued militant action that sometimes targeted collaborators and communities. The Rivonia Trial of 1963–64, which ended with life sentences for Nelson Mandela and other leaders, removed prominent activists to prison but also turned them into symbols of resistance. In the 1960s and early 1970s repression and exile pushed South African politics outward: many activists joined ANC structures in exile, worked in international solidarity networks or organised clandestinely inside the country. The balance between non-violent protest, legal action, and violent resistance created debates within the anti-apartheid movement about means, leadership and the effects on civilians.

## New forms of resistance: Black Consciousness, youth activism and labour unrest
By the late 1960s and 1970s new movements arose that reshaped resistance. The Black Consciousness Movement, led by figures such as Steve Biko and groups like the South African Students’ Organisation (SASO), emphasised psychological liberation, black pride and grassroots mobilisation. Black Consciousness rejected paternalistic leadership and sought to empower communities to refuse humiliation. Trade unions and workplace organising also became a powerful force. The Durban strikes of 1973 demonstrated the growing industrial strength of black workers, and the labour movement would become central to mass resistance in the 1980s. The Soweto uprising of 1976 was another watershed: schoolchildren protested the compulsory use of Afrikaans in schooling and the heavy-handed police response—including many deaths—ignited nationwide unrest and radicalised a generation. Those young people who survived detention, banning or exile often became the backbone of later community and township organising. Women’s groups, community civic organisations and church networks also challenged apartheid in ways that highlighted the system’s effects on family life, healthcare, housing and education.

## International pressure, sanctions and the Anti-Apartheid Movement
Domestic resistance was reinforced by international solidarity and pressure. From the late 1960s cultural and sporting boycotts aimed to isolate the regime, while in the 1970s and 1980s economic sanctions, disinvestment campaigns and trade restrictions were pushed by governments, churches, unions and student groups. The Anti-Apartheid Movement abroad mobilised public opinion, and countries and companies faced moral pressure to withdraw support. South Africa’s strategic value during the Cold War complicated responses: some Western states resisted strong sanctions for fear of driving the country into Soviet influence or disrupting mineral supplies. Nevertheless, sanctions and disinvestment affected the economy, raised the costs of repression and provided important political leverage. International law, United Nations resolutions and embargoes on arms sales all contributed to the sense that apartheid was an international pariah system. At the same time, the ANCs in exile benefited from alliances and training in some friendly states, and the global context of decolonisation and human rights amplified the moral force of anti-apartheid campaigns.

## The 1980s: mass resistance, state repression, political realignments and the road to negotiations
The 1980s saw escalating confrontation. Mass movements inside South Africa—united under formations such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) founded in 1983—organised boycotts, mass demonstrations and civic campaigns that brought wide sections of the population into active resistance. The state responded with states of emergency, mass arrests, detention without trial and intensified police and military actions. The political landscape also fractured: the National Party faced internal debates, the rise of Inkatha under Mangosuthu Buthelezi offered a competing Zulu nationalist force, and violence between Inkatha and ANC-aligned groups devastated communities in KwaZulu-Natal and parts of the Transvaal. The government’s “total strategy” sought to combine repression with limited reforms, but these failed to restore legitimacy. Military setbacks beyond its borders, especially after the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale in Angola where South African forces withdrew in the late 1980s, weakened the regime’s regional position. Economic decline, international isolation and a recognition that the cost of maintaining apartheid had become unsustainable pushed reform-minded figures within the state to consider negotiation. F. W. de Klerk’s rise and decision to unban the ANC and other groups, release Nelson Mandela in 1990 and open talks reflected a blend of pragmatic calculations and political opportunity rather than sudden conversion.

## Negotiation, transition and the 1994 election
The transition from apartheid to democracy was a negotiated and often fraught process. Unbanning of political organisations in 1990 allowed talks to begin between the state and previously banned movements. The negotiations dealt with complex issues: transitional security, the constitution, the role of the military, land and economic inequalities, and how to ensure an inclusive political settlement. Violence did not disappear during talks; assassinations and clashes continued to threaten progress. The interim constitution and agreements on electoral procedures led to the historic 1994 election in which all adult South Africans voted. The African National Congress won a decisive victory and Nelson Mandela became the country’s first black president. The transition emphasised negotiated settlement rather than retributive justice at the outset, though mechanisms for dealing with the past, such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, were part of the post-1994 landscape. The new democratic order had to confront entrenched economic disparities, social divisions and the legacies of decades of exclusion.

## Interpreting the period: causes, consequences and debate
Historians and commentators debate why apartheid finally ended when it did and how to interpret the roles of different actors. Explanations emphasise a combination of internal resistance and mobilisation, economic pressures and sanctions, strategic failures abroad, divisions within the white ruling elite, and skilful negotiation by leaders at the end of the regime. Some interpretations stress the agency of mass movements, youth and labour as the decisive factor; others point to the economic and diplomatic squeeze and the collapse of Cold War politics that removed anti-communist justifications for repression. Assessing significance involves weighing short-term triggers, such as the impact of the Soweto uprising or the effectiveness of disinvestment campaigns, against long-term structural changes like urbanisation and the growth of a politically aware black middle class. For GCSE study it is important to recognise that historical interpretations change with access to new sources, with shifting moral frameworks and with political developments after the period studied. Constructing balanced answers requires acknowledging complexities and showing how different factors combined to produce change.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on South Africa 1960–1994, begin by being clear about which assessment objective you are addressing. For AO1 demonstrate clear chronological knowledge: name key events, dates and figures and place them in sequence. For AO2 use second-order concepts: explain causes and consequences, identify change and continuity (for example by comparing the nature of resistance in the 1960s with that of the 1980s) and assess significance. For AO3 work with sources carefully: summarise what a source says, consider its origin and purpose, and use it with your own knowledge to make a judgement. For AO4 when dealing with interpretations, compare the arguments and consider why historians might disagree—think about the evidence available to them and their perspective. Structure longer answers with a clear introduction that outlines your line of argument, followed by paragraphs that address separate points, and finish with a conclusion that evaluates and synthesises your evidence. Use specific examples to support points: mention Sharpeville, the Rivonia Trial, Soweto, the UDF, the State of Emergency, Cuito Cuanavale, Mandela’s release and the 1994 election. When comparing sources, explicitly address both content and provenance and explain how each helps or limits what you can conclude. Manage your time so you spend longer on higher-mark questions and leave time to proofread answers for clarity and SPaG. Practise past papers, time your responses and learn model paragraphs that integrate knowledge and analysis. Above all, show that you can think like a historian: present evidence, consider different viewpoints and reach a reasoned, supported judgement.
