# Germany 1925–1955: The People and the State (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview and key questions
This study asks how the German people and the state interacted across a turbulent thirty years: the fragile late-Weimar Republic, the rise and rule of the Nazis, the experience of war and the Holocaust, and the consequences of defeat and occupation to 1955. The period is chosen so that students can see continuity and change: how crisis in the late 1920s and early 1930s helped bring the Nazis to power, how Nazi rule reshaped everyday life and institutions between 1933 and 1939, how the Second World War intensified state control and racial persecution, and how occupation, denazification and the emerging Cold War produced very different outcomes in East and West Germany. While studying these years, keep asking: what did the state try to achieve, how did its policies affect different groups, why did people support or resist, and how reliable are the sources that tell us about these events?

## Weimar context, 1925–1933: why democracy struggled
Understanding the background is essential. By 1925 the Weimar Republic had survived hyperinflation and a period of relative stability, but it remained weak in several ways. Political fragmentation meant frequent coalition governments and a legislature many Germans saw as distant and ineffective. Social tensions and memories of defeat in the First World War persisted, and extremist groups on left and right exploited these grievances. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the global depression that followed hit Germany hard: unemployment soared, businesses failed, and confidence in democratic elites collapsed. Against this backdrop the Nazi Party presented itself as a disciplined, nationalist alternative promising order, jobs and a reversal of national humiliation. It is important to recognise that Nazi support grew unevenly: electoral gains between 1929 and 1933 were dramatic, but different social groups were affected in different ways, and the appeal of the Nazis combined genuine support, fear of communism, and tactical voting by conservative elites.

## The rise and consolidation of Nazi power, 1933–1934
The transformation from a large party to a single-party state happened quickly and through a mix of legal measures, violence and co-option. After Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933, the Reichstag Fire in February was used to justify emergency measures that suspended civil liberties. The Enabling Act of March 1933 legally allowed the cabinet to enact laws without parliamentary consent; once passed, it provided a veneer of legality for one-party rule. The Nazis then set about Gleichschaltung, the ‘coordination’ of institutions: trade unions were banned and replaced by the German Labour Front, opposition parties were dissolved, and state governments and civil service were purged or aligned. The regime neutralised potential rivals within the movement itself at the Night of the Long Knives in June 1934, when the leadership eliminated the SA’s threat and asserted control over the army. By the death of President Hindenburg in August 1934, Hitler combined the offices of Chancellor and President and Germany had what the Nazis called a Führer state. When revising this phase, be ready to explain both the deliberate legal manipulation and the role of force and intimidation in destroying pluralism.

## Nazi Germany and its people, 1933–1939
Once in power the regime aimed to create a Volksgemeinschaft, a racially defined national community. This goal was pursued through propaganda, social policy, economic measures and repression. The Ministry of Propaganda under Goebbels promoted Nazi ideas through newspapers, radio, film and mass rallies; culture was tightly controlled to present an image of unity and strength. Economic policy emphasised public works, rearmament and measures designed to reduce unemployment and create the impression of recovery; rearmament also bound the economy to the regime’s militaristic aims. Social policy targeted women and youth as bearers of the nation’s future: women were encouraged to focus on Kinder, Küche, Kirche (children, kitchen, church) while organisations such as the Hitler Youth prepared young people for service. At the same time the state pursued racial policies that progressively excluded and persecuted Jews and other minorities. Early measures included boycotts and professional bans in 1933, but the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 legally defined Jews as outsiders and stripped them of citizenship. Violent escalations such as Kristallnacht in November 1938 revealed how persecution could shift from legal discrimination to organised terror. The Nazis also pursued eugenics and sterilisation programmes; later, selective killings of the disabled (the T4 programme) showed the regime’s lethal application of racial ideas. While some Germans accepted or supported these changes, others accommodated the regime out of fear, self-interest, or indifference. A careful answer will distinguish visible conformity and opportunism from deep ideological commitment.

## War, the Holocaust and the legacy of total war, 1939–1945
The outbreak of war in 1939 did not simply expand Nazi ambitions abroad; it accelerated policies at home and intensified state control. Early military successes in Poland, France and the Low Countries strengthened the regime’s prestige, but the war quickly became more destructive and demanding. The invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and the entry of the United States into the war transformed the scale of violence. The Holocaust developed in stages: radicalisation on the Eastern Front, mobile killing units, and the decision at Wannsee in 1942 to implement the ‘Final Solution’ led to the industrial-scale murder of six million Jews in extermination camps such as Auschwitz and Treblinka. The regime also organised mass deportations, ghettos and the use of forced labour drawn from occupied territories. As Germany's military position weakened after 1942, the regime attempted to mobilise the whole population in total war: rationing tightened, bombing raids destroyed civilian areas, and organisations like the Volkssturm recruited elderly and young men for last-ditch defence. Opposition existed but was fragmented: small-scale acts of resistance, religious protests, and plots by some conservative and military figures demonstrate that resistance took several forms but remained limited in scale and impact. When answering questions about the war years, separate the military narrative from the social and ideological elements, and be clear about how the intensification of the war enabled the most extreme crimes.

## Defeat, occupation and division, 1945–1955
Germany's unconditional surrender in May 1945 left the country occupied, devastated and under Allied control. The victorious powers divided Germany into occupation zones, each pursuing different policies that nonetheless shared common aims: punish Nazism, rebuild a stable society, and prevent future aggression. The immediate post-war years saw efforts at denazification, prosecutions of leading Nazis at Nuremberg, the dismantling of some Nazi organisations and attempts to re-educate the population. Reality, however, was shaped by shortages, mass displacement, and the need to re-establish administration. The onset of the Cold War quickly altered priorities: Western Allies shifted toward reconstruction and integration with Western Europe, while the Soviet occupation established a communist administration in the East. Currency reform and the Marshall Plan aided recovery in the West, and the Berlin Blockade of 1948–49 highlighted superpower tensions. By 1949 two German states emerged: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). By 1955 West Germany’s admission to NATO and the formal creation of the Warsaw Pact in the East marked the consolidation of the Cold War division. Denazification’s intensity varied, and many former Nazis reintegrated into post-war institutions, a fact that fuelled later debates about continuity and responsibility.

## Sources and interpretations: how historians investigate 1925–1955
Studying this period requires careful use of many types of sources and an awareness of interpretative debates. Primary evidence includes government laws and decrees, speeches, propaganda posters, film and radio broadcasts, police and SS records, personal diaries and letters, trial transcripts, and contemporary newspaper reports. Each source has strengths and limitations: official Nazi documents can reveal policy aims but are often self-justifying; propaganda shows intended messages but not private beliefs; survivor testimonies are essential for understanding persecution but require sensitivity to trauma and memory. The major historiographical debates students should know include the question of popular support versus coercion (how much did ordinary Germans actively support Nazi policies?), and the intentionalist versus functionalist arguments about the Holocaust (whether the genocide was the result of pre-planned directives from the top or the outcome of a chaotic bureaucracy and wartime radicalisation). There are also debates about the nature of Nazi totalitarianism, the extent and effectiveness of resistance, and the long-term effects of denazification. When you explore these debates, link evidence to argument: show how particular documents or testimonies support one interpretation or problematise it.

## Exam technique
In essay questions start with a clear answer to the question and map out the argument briefly before developing it. For causation questions, explain short-term triggers and long-term structural causes, and assess their relative importance. When using sources, always consider provenance: who produced the source, when, for what audience, and why? Discuss the source’s value and limitations and support your points with knowledge not contained in the source. In questions about interpretations, identify the main claim in each interpretation and explain why historians might hold this view; then use specific evidence to support or challenge each interpretation. For timing, divide your exam time according to the paper guidance: spend more time on the extended essay and be sure to plan before you write. Use precise historical terms (Gleichschaltung, Enabling Act, Volksgemeinschaft, Nuremberg Laws, Wannsee) and make sure spelling and grammar are clear, as these are rewarded. Finally, link details to the big picture: exam answers that combine solid factual knowledge with analysis of causes, consequences and differing viewpoints score highly.
