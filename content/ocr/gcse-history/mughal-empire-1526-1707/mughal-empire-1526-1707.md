# The Mughal Empire (1526–1707) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what the Mughal Empire was and why it matters
The Mughal Empire was one of the great early modern empires of Asia, ruling much of the Indian subcontinent between 1526 and 1707. It was founded by Babur after his victory at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 and reached its greatest territorial extent under the later emperors. The Mughals created a highly centralised state with a sophisticated court culture, a thriving economy based on agriculture and trade, and a distinctive artistic and architectural style. For GCSE study, the period 1526–1707 is useful because it shows how charismatic rulers, administrative innovation and cultural exchange could build a powerful empire, and how changing policies and long wars could create the conditions for decline. Understanding the Mughal story helps explain later developments in South Asian history, including regional resistance, the growth of regional powers, and the gradual arrival of European influence.

## The first emperors: Babur and Humayun (1526–1556)
The Mughal story begins with Babur, a Central Asian dynasty prince who used superior military organisation and firearms to defeat larger Indian armies. His victory at Panipat in 1526 established Mughal rule in northern India. Babur was a skilled commander and memoirist, but the dynasty he began was fragile. His son Humayun faced serious challenges, including rivalry among Afghan nobles and the rise of Sher Shah Suri, who defeated Humayun in 1540. Humayun spent years in exile before recovering the throne in 1555, but he died soon after in 1556. The early period shows how empires depend on strong leadership and military technology, and how setbacks (in Humayun’s case, loss and exile) could interrupt dynastic continuity. The rule of the Suri interlude is important because Sher Shah Suri introduced practical administrative measures, such as standardised coinage and road improvements, which influenced later Mughal rulers.

## Akbar (1556–1605): consolidation, expansion and new administration
Akbar’s accession in 1556 marks the start of a decisive phase. He was only a teenager when he became emperor, but his reign transformed the Mughal state. Akbar consolidated Mughal control across northern and central India, using a mixture of military campaigns and negotiated alliances with local rulers. He developed a centralised administrative system that professionalised governance: the mansabdari system organised officers by rank and assigned them responsibilities for military service, while revenue reforms, largely associated with Todar Mal, introduced more systematic land measurement and assessment. Akbar also pursued a policy of accommodation towards India’s religious diversity. His ideology of Sulh-i-kul (peace with all) and attempts to foster dialogue between Hindus and Muslims reduced conflict within the empire and supported stability. He promoted a Persianate court culture that made Persian the language of administration and high culture, but he also incorporated local elites into the administration, creating a flexible imperial elite. Akbar’s new capital at Fatehpur Sikri, though short-lived as a seat of government, symbolised the synthesis of architectural forms and the luxury of the court. Under Akbar the Mughal Empire became a durable political and cultural structure.

## Jahangir and Shah Jahan (1605–1658): court culture, art and trade
The period from Jahangir to Shah Jahan is notable for the flourishing of Mughal court culture and the increasing role of foreign trade. Jahangir continued many of Akbar’s policies but is especially remembered for patronage of the arts, including the refinement of the Mughal miniature painting tradition. His reign also saw the rise of influential courtiers and women such as Nur Jahan, who exercised real power at court. European traders—Portuguese, Dutch and increasingly the English—expanded their presence, seeking trade privileges and establishing factories. The English East India Company was active from the early seventeenth century and began building relationships with Mughal merchants and officials.

Shah Jahan’s reign (1628–1658) is famous for monumental architecture and a high point of Mughal splendour. His patronage produced Shahjahanabad (the new capital in Delhi) with its Red Fort, and the Taj Mahal at Agra, built as a grand mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, which symbolises Mughal architectural achievement. Shah Jahan’s court demonstrated the empire’s wealth, with luxuriant tastes and centralised administration. Yet his reign also involved expensive military campaigns and a heavy court expenditure that placed fiscal pressure on the state and created tensions that would matter in the succession crisis to come.

## Aurangzeb (1658–1707): religious policy, long wars and consequences
Aurangzeb’s long reign brought major changes in policy and marked the beginning of the empire’s long-term weakening. He emerged victorious in a brutal succession struggle in 1658 against his brothers, including Dara Shikoh, who had been a champion of syncretic cultural policies. Aurangzeb was a devout Sunni Muslim and increasingly pursued orthodox religious policies. He formally reimposed the jizya tax on non-Muslims in 1679 and took a less tolerant stance than Akbar had. Aurangzeb also extended the empire southwards with intensive campaigns in the Deccan. From the 1680s he waged long, draining wars against regional powers such as the Marathas and annexed independent sultanates like Bijapur and Golconda. These campaigns overstretched the imperial resources, exposed weaknesses in logistics and control, and intensified local resistance. By the time of Aurangzeb’s death in 1707 the empire was territorially large but politically fragile, with provincial governors (and newly empowered regional rulers) able to challenge central authority. The combination of religiously divisive policies, costly warfare and administrative strains set the stage for decentralisation and decline in the eighteenth century.

## Society, economy and culture under the Mughals
Mughal rule rested on an agrarian economy. Land revenue, assessed on village production, provided the state’s main income and was collected through systems that combined central oversight with local intermediaries. The mansabdari and jagir systems linked military service and administrative office to revenue assignments: mansabdars received salary-like payments in the form of jagirs, which were rights to collect revenue from specified territories. Cities such as Agra, Delhi and Lahore became centres of administration, crafts and long-distance trade. The empire participated in international commerce: Indian textile goods, spices and other products were traded widely, attracting European firms that sought fabrics and spices in return for bullion and finished goods.

Culturally, the Mughal court promoted a synthesis of Persian, Central Asian and Indian traditions. Persian literature, painting, and architecture were central, but local languages and Hindu artistic influences also shaped the culture. Mughal miniatures, calligraphy, carpet-making and monumental building demonstrate a cosmopolitan elite culture. Religion was a prominent theme: while Sunni Islam shaped state ideology, the empire encompassed Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and many other faiths. Mughal policy towards religion varied with each emperor, so the social atmosphere ranged from Akbar’s pluralism to Aurangzeb’s orthodoxy. This diversity and the interaction of elites and local communities are essential to understanding how the empire governed such a large and varied population.

## Why the Mughal Empire matters: causes, consequences and comparisons
The Mughal Empire mattered because it created a large, relatively integrated political space in South Asia and introduced administrative practices that influenced later rulers. Its fiscal and military systems, administrative centralisation and recruitment of local elites were models of state-building. The cultural achievements of the Mughal period—especially architecture and painting—had lasting influence on South Asian art and identity. The empire’s decline after 1707 also matters historically: it opened a century of rivalry between regional powers and foreign companies; it made possible, in the longer term, the establishment of European colonial rule. For historians the Mughal case is useful because it illustrates themes like the role of charismatic rulers, the importance of administrative reform, the limits of conquest without consolidation, and the consequences of religious and fiscal policies for imperial longevity.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the Mughal Empire, remember to combine accurate factual knowledge with clear analysis. For short recall questions, give precise names and dates, for example Panipat 1526, Akbar’s accession 1556, Shah Jahan’s building of the Taj Mahal beginning c.1632, and Aurangzeb’s death in 1707. For "explain" or "describe" questions, organise your answer either chronologically or thematically: if asked to explain Akbar’s success, discuss military strength, administrative reforms (mansabdari, revenue measures), and his policy of accommodation. When asked "how far" or to make a judgement, set out criteria early, weigh the evidence on both sides and reach a clear conclusion that answers the question directly.

For source-based and interpretation questions, practise the four key moves: identify what the source says, assess its provenance (who produced it, when and why), evaluate its usefulness or limitations, and then support your assessment with outside knowledge. For example, if a European traveller praises Mughal wealth, note that the traveller may have been impressed by court splendour and may not have seen rural poverty; then add specific knowledge such as the impact of high taxation in some regions or variation between prosperous and poor provinces. When comparing interpretations, consider the authors’ backgrounds—whether they were Mughal courtiers, European merchants, modern historians or nationalist writers—and explain how that could shape their view.

Use key terms accurately. Know administrative words such as mansabdari and jagir, and cultural terms such as Persianate, miniature and Sulh-i-kul. Include specific examples to back up statements: name emperors, battles, reforms and buildings. Time your answers so you leave time for planning and for checking spelling and dates in longer answers. Finally, practise past-paper questions under timed conditions so you are confident in structuring answers that combine AO1 knowledge and AO2 analysis, and for the depth study questions build the habit of supporting judgments with precise factual detail.
