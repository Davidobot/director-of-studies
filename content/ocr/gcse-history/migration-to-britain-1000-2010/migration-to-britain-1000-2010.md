# Migration to Britain c.1000–c.2010 (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview and themes
Migration to Britain c.1000–c.2010 asks you to think about a very long story: how and why people have moved to, from and around these islands for more than a thousand years, and how those movements have affected British society. Rather than a sequence of isolated events, this unit asks you to spot patterns of continuity and change across three broad eras (c.1000–1500, c.1500–1900 and 1900–c.2010). The main themes to carry through your study are reasons for migration, the experiences and actions of migrants, the responses of local communities and governments, and the impact of migration on culture, economy, religion and politics. You should also consider how ideas of identity – what it meant to be “English” or “British” – have shifted as new people arrived and settled.

Studying migration is not only about names and dates. It is about interpreting sources and places: how buildings, street names, maps, documents and oral histories can tell a story about who moved where and why. It is also about understanding different kinds of movement: voluntary and forced migration, temporary and permanent settlement, labour migration, refugee flows and imperial movements. Keep the key historical concepts in mind as you study—cause, consequence, continuity, change and significance—to help you organise answers and compare periods.

## c.1000–1500: early diversity and medieval migration
England was more diverse before and after 1066 than many people imagine. Migratory movements before 1500 included Viking raids and settlements, the Norman Conquest and the arrival of small numbers of merchants, artisans and specialists from continental Europe. The Norman takeover in 1066 restructured landholding, government and law and brought new people and institutions to England; it also stimulated some resistance.

One of the clearest examples of medieval migration is the Jewish community. Jews first established a presence in Norman England after 1066 and became important in finance and trade, but they also faced discrimination and violence and were expelled in 1290. Other migrants included merchants and craftsmen described as resident “aliens” who lived and worked in towns, sometimes integrating and sometimes remaining distinct. Patterns of migration were shaped by trade routes, political alliances and military events, and the impact of newcomers could be local and profound even when numbers were small.

When you study this era, ask how migration changed local economies and social relations, and how medieval governing institutions regulated or restricted migrants. Consider the limits of the evidence: records survive unevenly, so historians must read charters, legal records and the physical traces in towns to build explanations.

## c.1500–1900: empire, ports and economic change
From the sixteenth century the scale and character of migration changed. England’s expanding maritime trade and the early stages of empire brought Africans, Asians and people from other European countries into British ports. Africans were present in sixteenth-century England in small but visible numbers; some were servants or sailors, others found work in towns. The formation and expansion of trading companies, most notably the East India Company, opened links with the Indian subcontinent that produced Lascar sailors, ayahs (child or domestic attendants), merchants and other arrivals in port towns.

This period also saw the readmission of Jews in the mid-seventeenth century and the arrival of religious refugees such as Huguenots and Palatines, who often settled in towns and brought skills that shaped local industries. The Industrial Revolution and urbanisation attracted Irish and Scottish migrants to English towns, and the growth of port cities produced multicultural communities where different languages, religions and customs met.

Imperial expansion had a two-way relationship with migration. The slave trade and plantation economies produced forced migration on an enormous scale, and ports like Bristol, Liverpool and London became central to the trade in enslaved Africans. At the same time, profits from colonial trade, new consumer markets and changing ideas about race and labour affected life in Britain. Economic changes such as the creation of the Bank of England and speculative episodes like the South Sea Bubble show how closely metropolitan economy and imperial enterprise were linked.

When you revise this era, focus on how economic, political and religious changes encouraged particular movements of people, and how migrants both influenced and were affected by local communities, laws and attitudes.

## 1900–c.2010: modern migration, legislation and multicultural Britain
The twentieth century brought the most sustained and diverse migration to Britain. Port communities continued to grow in the early decades, while restrictive and permissive legislation after 1900 shaped who could enter and settle. The Aliens Act 1905 and wartime immigration controls show early attempts to regulate newcomers. Two world wars affected migrants and their descendants in different ways: refugee flows in the 1930s brought Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution, while large numbers of Poles and others settled in Britain after 1945.

The post-war era saw major changes in Britain’s population because of migration from the Caribbean, South Asia and Africa. The 1948 British Nationality Act created a framework that allowed many citizens of the former colonies to settle in the UK; arrivals such as those on the ship Empire Windrush became symbolic of new multicultural communities. Over time, political responses shifted: Acts in the 1960s and 1970s, including the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and later nationality legislation, progressively limited immigration from the Commonwealth. Race relations legislation from the 1960s and 1970s began to confront discrimination, while debates about immigration often became entangled with broader political discussions about national identity.

By the 1990s and 2000s migration was a high-profile political issue. The asylum system, the treatment of refugees, and the effect of free movement within the European Union (for example after EU enlargement) all shaped public debate. The concept of multiculturalism became contested: some voices praised Britain’s diverse cultural life, while others argued for stronger assimilation. Events such as riots, public inquiries and policy reviews focused attention on social integration, discrimination and the lived experience of migrants and their children.

When revising this period, link legislation and public debate to migrants’ lived experiences. Learn case studies—Windrush, particular refugee communities, or the experiences of port neighbourhoods—to show detailed knowledge in answers.

## The Impact of Empire on Britain 1688–c.1730 (linked depth study)
The depth study on the impact of empire c.1688–c.1730 complements the long sweep of the migration theme by focusing on how early imperial expansion transformed Britain’s economy, politics and society. The Glorious Revolution and the Hanoverian succession reshaped Britain’s international position and its internal politics, while commercial expansion and colonial ventures altered consumption, finance and social life.

Key developments include the establishment of the Bank of England (1694), the growth of trade with India and China under the East India Company, the lifting of the Royal African Company’s monopoly (1698) which expanded the Atlantic slave trade, and the commercial consequences of treaties such as Utrecht (1713). The Darien Scheme and the Act of Union of 1707 show how imperial ambition could have political as well as economic causes and consequences. The unlocking of consumer markets at home created demand for exotic goods, leading to changes in everyday life and to the growth of port economies that relied on migrant labour and international shipping.

This depth study is a good opportunity to practise source work: you will be asked to use contemporary documents and material evidence to explain how empire affected Britain and to evaluate its significance. Think about how ideas of racial hierarchy and the development of slave-based economies affected social relations in Britain, including the emergence of both pro-slavery commercial interests and early anti-slavery voices.

## Urban Environments: Patterns of Migration (historic environment)
The historic environment study asks you to bring the long themes of the unit down to a place you can investigate. OCR specified a rotating set of port-area sites for early years and fixed Spitalfields, London, as a set site from 2020 onwards, while earlier examples used Butetown in Cardiff and South Shields. Urban environments are powerful sources of evidence: buildings, shop-fronts, monuments, street names, cemetery inscriptions, maps and local archives all carry traces of migration.

Your task is to read the urban fabric as evidence. Look for changes in building use, concentrations of particular religious or commercial institutions, memorials and the organisation of space that indicate settlement patterns. Complement physical evidence with documentary sources such as parish records, newspapers and oral histories to build a fuller picture of how and when particular groups arrived, how they were received, what work they did and how they contributed to the local economy and culture.

Make sure you practise using different kinds of source, explain what they can tell you and what they leave out, and link local examples to national developments covered in the thematic study.

## Approaches to sources and interpretations
Migration history requires careful use of sources because evidence is often partial and contested. Primary sources for this topic include legal acts, government reports, parish records, newspapers, personal letters and memoirs, travel accounts, trade records and material culture. Each source has strengths and limits: official records can show how governments tried to regulate migration but may miss everyday experiences; oral histories capture personal memory but can reflect particular perspectives.

When dealing with interpretations, remember that historians’ views change as new evidence emerges or as priorities change. For example, historians emphasise different aspects of medieval diversity now than a generation ago, and modern scholarship highlights the long-standing presence of Africans and Asians in Britain. Being able to explain why interpretations differ—because of new archives, changing political contexts or different questions being asked—is an important skill for this unit.

## Exam technique
In the exam, organise your time and answers to match the marks and assessment objectives. For source questions, first summarise what each source says, then compare their content and provenance: who produced them, when and why, and how that affects what they tell us. When asked to describe or outline, give precise, chronological detail and link facts to the question. For “explain” questions use cause-and-effect paragraphs that start with a clear topic sentence, provide evidence, and end with a linking sentence that answers the question directly.

Extended answers and essays should use the historical concepts of change, continuity, cause and consequence to structure a coherent argument. Start with a short plan and a clear thesis that addresses the question. In the body, develop focused paragraphs each with a point, evidence and explanation; avoid narrative that does not connect to the question. For interpretation questions, do more than paraphrase the interpretation: assess its assumptions, use supporting knowledge to test it, compare it with other views and reach a balanced judgement.

Practice source evaluation by considering content, tone and purpose and by thinking about omissions and silences. For the historic environment questions, always link physical evidence to contemporary documents and explain what the site reveals about migration and what else you would need to know.

Remember there are SPaG marks for extended answers, so write clearly using specialist terms (for example: “naturalisation”, “Bantustan”, “diaspora”, “empire”, “asylum seeker”), check spelling, and use punctuation to make your argument easy to follow. Regular practice under timed conditions, using past-style questions and marking against the assessment objectives (AO1–AO4), will build the skills you need to show both secure knowledge and a confident ability to interpret and evaluate evidence.
