# The Making of America (1789–1900) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction: why this period matters
The period from 1789 to 1900 tracks the transformation of the United States from a new constitutional republic to an industrialising power whose territory and influence stretched from the Atlantic to the Pacific and beyond. This story is shaped by expansion, conflict and competing visions of what the nation should be. Themes you will return to throughout the course include territorial growth and its consequences, the centrality of slavery and race to politics and society, the experiences of indigenous peoples, the shifting lives of African Americans, and the economic and social changes of industrialisation and mass migration. Understanding this period helps explain how geography, ideas such as Manifest Destiny, market forces and political choices combined to create striking advances and deep injustices that shaped modern America.

## America’s expansion, 1789–1838
The early republic set out to define itself both institutionally and geographically. The federal government established by the Constitution of 1789 under presidents like Washington and Jefferson was followed by rapid territorial growth, most famously the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 which doubled the size of the United States and opened vast lands for settlement. Economic changes mattered as much as political ones: the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 and improvements in transportation accelerated the expansion of southern cotton plantations and made slavery still more profitable. At the same time the market revolution was transforming northern and western economies through canals, roads and early railways, encouraging migration and town-building.

Territorial expansion had immediate human consequences. Native American nations faced mounting pressure as settlers moved west. Federal policy shifted from negotiation to removal. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorised the forced relocation of indigenous peoples from the eastern states, culminating in events such as the Cherokee Trail of Tears in the mid-1830s, when thousands died during forced marches. Migration, land hunger and state-building combined to make the first half of the nineteenth century an era where the promise of opportunity for many meant dispossession and suffering for others.

## The West, 1839–1860
The period often labelled the “West” in American history is not a single place but a series of frontiers where cultures collided and new communities formed. Plains Indians such as the Lakota Sioux developed a horse-centred, buffalo-based economy that suited the grasslands, while migrants poured along the Oregon and California trails seeking land, opportunity and religious freedom. The Mormon migration to Utah in 1847 illustrates how religious communities used westward movement to create alternative societies. The discovery of gold in California in 1848 triggered a mass rush of fortune-seekers in 1849 and accelerated the incorporation of the Pacific coast into the United States.

Expansion in these decades was driven by ideas as well as events. The phrase “Manifest Destiny” captured a belief many Americans held that the United States was destined to spread its institutions and civilisation across the continent. Politically, expansion raised contentious questions about the extension of slavery into new territories, a debate that increasingly polarised North and South and fed the crises that would lead to civil war. The Mexican–American War (1846–1848) and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo added vast new territories and further complicated sectional tensions.

## Civil War and Reconstruction, 1861–1877
The conflict between competing visions of slavery, federal power and the future of the Union culminated in the American Civil War. Secession by Southern states after Lincoln’s election in 1860 led to open warfare from 1861 to 1865. The war involved large-scale battles, enormous human cost and decisive political steps: the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 reframed the war as a struggle to end slavery, and by 1865 the Union victory and the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery across the United States.

The years after the war, known as Reconstruction, were a period of intense political experimentation and violent reaction. Federal initiatives sought to rebuild the South and to secure civil and political rights for formerly enslaved people. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments promised citizenship and voting rights. For a time, African Americans held public office and there were advances in education and land ownership. Yet white resistance—through Black Codes, paramilitary violence and organised intimidation—undermined many of these gains. By 1877, the Compromise that ended contested presidential politics also effectively ended federal enforcement of Reconstruction in the South, ushering in a long era of segregation and disenfranchisement for African Americans.

## Settlement and conflict on the Plains, 1861–1877
At the same time as the Civil War and Reconstruction unfolded in the East and South, the Great Plains became the focus of intense contestation. New transportation networks, most importantly transcontinental railroads, opened markets and made large-scale settlement possible. Federal policy encouraged homesteading through the Homestead Act of 1862, offering land to settlers prepared to farm it. Ranching, rail-linked cattle drives and the growth of cow towns reshaped the Plains economy.

These changes collided with Native American lifeways. Competition for land, treaty violations and the destruction of the buffalo by commercial hunters undermined indigenous economies. Armed conflict followed, often sparked by broken promises and cultural misunderstanding as well as by settler violence. Little Crow’s War in Minnesota in 1862, Red Cloud’s War in the late 1860s, and the Great Sioux War of 1876–1877, which included the famous Battle of the Little Bighorn, are examples of how Plains Indians resisted encroachment. The period shows both Native American agency and the overwhelming pressures—military, economic and demographic—that transformed their societies.

## American cultures, 1877–1900
The closing decades of the nineteenth century are often called the Gilded Age, a phrase that captures stark contrasts: spectacular wealth and sharp social problems. Industrial capitalism created large corporations and entrepreneurs such as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, whose businesses dominated steel, oil and railroads. Rapid urbanisation followed, with cities like New York and Chicago growing into major industrial and commercial centres. Urban life brought new forms of work, mass housing in tenements, and social strains that produced both reform movements and political machines.

Immigration from Europe increased dramatically in the late nineteenth century, bringing new labour, cultural diversity, and tensions over urban space and jobs. The changing economy provoked labour unrest and the formation of unions; incidents such as the Haymarket affair in 1886 symbolised the clash between labour and capital. For African Americans the end of Reconstruction meant the consolidation of segregation through Jim Crow laws and legal decisions such as Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 that upheld “separate but equal” treatment, effectively institutionalising racial inequality. For Native Americans, the late nineteenth century brought reservation life, loss of land and dramatic cultural change.

By the end of the century the United States reached beyond its continental borders. The Spanish–American War of 1898 marked a turning point at which the United States began to exert power overseas, acquiring territories such as Puerto Rico and the Philippines and signalling a new international role that grew from the economic, demographic and strategic forces developed through the nineteenth century.

## Themes to carry through your study
Several connected themes will help you make sense of the chronology and provide material for examination answers. First, consider how expansion—political, territorial and economic—reshaped societies and provoked conflict. Second, always connect the institution of slavery and the ideology of race to political decisions, social structures and economic development, especially in the South and in debates over new territories. Third, treat indigenous peoples and African Americans as active agents whose choices, resistance and survival strategies matter to explanations of change. Fourth, understand industrialisation, urbanisation and immigration as linked processes that created both opportunity and dislocation, producing reform movements, labour actions and new political alignments. Finally, look for continuity as well as change: ideas about American identity, rights and belonging were contested throughout the period, and many debates that began in these years continued into the twentieth century.

## Teaching and case-study suggestions
To make the narrative concrete, use focused case studies that show human experience. For the early period, study the Trail of Tears through eyewitness accounts and government documents to illustrate removal policy and its human cost. For the West, use diaries and letters from migrants on the Oregon or California trails alongside Native American perspectives to compare experiences. For the Civil War, study the Gettysburg Address and soldiers’ letters to explore the war’s meanings, and use the text of the Emancipation Proclamation and the Reconstruction Amendments to examine legal change. For Plains conflict, adopt a Lakota case study that traces how horse culture, the buffalo economy and treaty-making shaped resistance. For the Gilded Age, follow a single city and a particular industry to connect immigration, labour and urban politics. Primary sources—speeches, laws, photographs, census and treaty documents—are excellent for developing analysis and understanding of historical context.

## Exam technique
In exams keep clarity and evidence at the heart of your answers. For short factual recall questions, practise precise, named answers with dates where appropriate. For structured narrative questions that ask you to “write a clear and organised summary,” plan a chronological framework and select two or three key points supported by specific examples and dates. For explanation questions such as “Why did...?” focus on causes or consequences, making sure you assess relative importance and avoid simple lists. For “How far” evaluation essays, present a balanced argument that analyses differing factors, compares their significance, and ends with a clear judgement supported by evidence. When working with sources, put them in context before analysing content; note what the source tells you, what it omits, and consider provenance—who produced it, when and why—as part of your evaluation. For interpretations, explain how historians’ viewpoints might be shaped by the evidence used or the concerns of their time, and use your wider knowledge to agree, disagree or qualify those interpretations.

Manage your time by allocating minutes in advance for planning, writing and checking. Use paragraph openings that signal your argument and include dates and specific names to demonstrate detailed knowledge. Always link evidence back to the question, avoid over-generalisation, and write a short concluding sentence that answers the question directly. Practise past-style questions under timed conditions, then review answers for balance, use of evidence and clarity of judgement, and aim to improve both factual depth and analytical structure with each attempt.
