# Living under Nazi Rule (1933–1945) (GCSE History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: why this study matters
Living under Nazi rule is a world depth study because it focuses on a compact, intense period when ideology, state power and war combined to transform millions of lives. Between 1933 and 1945 Germany moved from a fragile democracy to a totalitarian regime that used law, propaganda, terror and war to change society and to attempt the radical remaking of Europe. For GCSE students this topic is important because it links political decisions with everyday experience: how ordinary people responded, how groups were persecuted, and how rulers used institutions to achieve their aims. It also trains you to use a wide range of sources — speeches, posters, eyewitness testimony and official records — and to think about how historians construct different interpretations of the same events.

## From democracy to dictatorship, January 1933–1934
Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 did not immediately create a full dictatorship. The regime used a mixture of opportunism and legal changes to seize and then consolidate power. The Reichstag Fire in February 1933 was used to frighten opponents and justify the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended civil liberties. The Enabling Act of March 1933 then gave the government the power to pass laws without parliamentary consent; through this single legal step the Nazi leadership could dismantle checks and balances while still appearing to respect legality. The process known as Gleichschaltung brought state governments, trade unions, political parties and cultural institutions into line with Nazi goals. The elimination of rivals continued with violence, most notoriously during the Night of the Long Knives in June 1934, when the regime purged internal opponents and secured the loyalty of the army. By August 1934, with Hindenburg’s death, Hitler merged the offices of Chancellor and President, cementing his position as Führer.

## Repression: the machinery of control
Once in power the Nazi state developed multiple instruments of repression that worked together. The SS grew from a bodyguard unit into a vast organisation that included the Waffen-SS, the security service (SD) and control over the concentration camp system. The Gestapo, the secret police, prowled German towns and workplaces; its methods of surveillance and arbitrary arrest created a climate of fear. Special courts, such as the People’s Court, removed legal protection for political opponents and handed down show trials and death sentences. Concentration camps, first built to imprison political prisoners, quickly evolved into a network where Jews, Roma, homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, the disabled and political dissidents were interned, exploited for labour and, in many cases, murdered. Understanding these institutions helps explain both the effectiveness of Nazi control and why resistance was so dangerous.

## Propaganda, culture and youth: shaping beliefs and behaviour
The regime’s control of information and culture was central to its rule. Joseph Goebbels led a sophisticated propaganda machine that used radio, film, newspapers, mass rallies and visual arts to promote Nazi ideas and to normalise anti‑Semitism and militarism. Cinema and newsreels shaped perceptions of national strength; radio broadcasts reached millions with speeches and directives. Education and youth movements were reworked to form future citizens loyal to Nazi ideals. School curricula emphasised race, physical fitness and obedience, while organisations such as the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls provided paramilitary training, collective rituals and a culture of loyalty. At the same time, traditional institutions like the church and professional bodies were pressured to conform, creating both compliance and pockets of opposition. For many Germans, the daily experience included public rituals, a sense of renewed national pride, and new opportunities in rearmament and public works, even as freedoms were curtailed.

## Racial policy and the persecution of Jews: from exclusion to genocide
Racial policy was central to Nazi ideology and became increasingly radical between 1933 and 1945. Early measures sought to exclude Jews from public life by removing them from civil service jobs, professions and cultural institutions. The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 defined Jewishness in legal terms and stripped Jews of citizenship, while state-sponsored discrimination intensified social isolation. Kristallnacht in November 1938 marked a decisive escalation: synagogues were burned, Jewish businesses destroyed and thousands arrested. With the outbreak of war and especially after the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, persecution turned into organised mass murder. Mobile killing units (Einsatzgruppen) followed the Wehrmacht and carried out mass shootings of Jews and other victims across eastern Europe. The Nazi leadership then moved towards the industrialised killing that characterised the Holocaust: ghettos concentrated Jewish populations, deportations began, and extermination camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka and Sobibor were used to kill on a massive scale. The Wannsee Conference of January 1942 coordinated policy for the “Final Solution”, the systematic annihilation of European Jewry. Alongside the genocide of Jews, other victims were murdered in programmes such as the T4 euthanasia project, and thousands of Roma and disabled people were targeted for incarceration or killing.

## Occupied Europe: administration, collaboration and resistance
Nazi rule in occupied territories varied widely, reflecting different goals, racial policies and practical needs. In the west, in countries such as France, the degree of direct Nazi administration was mixed with local collaborationist regimes like Vichy. In the east, territories conquered after 1939 were often treated as lands to be exploited, colonised and cleared of their local populations. The General Government in Poland and the brutal occupation policies in the Soviet Union emphasised exploitation, forced labour and mass murder. Collaboration took many forms: political collaboration by local elites, administrative cooperation to keep services running, and economic collaboration under pressure or in pursuit of advantage. Yet there was also resistance. Underground movements ranged from the Polish Home Army fighting an organised underground war, to partisan bands in the Soviet Union, and to smaller acts of defiance such as hiding Jews, producing illicit newspapers or staging assassinations. In Germany itself there were conspiracies and moral protests, from the White Rose student movement to military officers who attempted to assassinate Hitler in 1944. Responses were complex: some people collaborated out of belief or expediency, many accommodated themselves, and others resisted at great risk.

## War, total war and the collapse of the regime, 1939–1945
War transformed Nazi rule. Early military successes masked deep strains. To feed the Wehrmacht and the economy the regime used increasing levels of forced labour drawn from occupied countries and concentration camps. The shift to “total war” in 1943, driven by defeats on the Eastern Front and the Allied bombing campaign, led to tighter controls, harsher repression and the mobilisation of all remaining resources, including the conscription of teenagers and older men into the Volkssturm. The Allied strategic bombing campaign and the Soviet advance brought the violence home: cities were destroyed, civilian morale collapsed and the Nazi promise of a triumphant future evaporated. As the Wehrmacht retreated in 1944–45, mass killings accelerated in some regions, while the regime’s central authority weakened. The final months saw chaotic evacuations, death marches of camp inmates, and the disintegration of state structures. Germany’s unconditional surrender in May 1945 revealed the full scale of the regime’s crimes and left Europe to confront the human and material consequences of dictatorship and war.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Living under Nazi Rule it helps to be clear about the command words and the assessment objectives you are targeting. For knowledge questions, aim to give precise facts and dates and to place events in sequence so that the examiner can see an understanding of change over time. For "explain" and "why" questions, organise your answer into linked paragraphs that identify causes or effects, explain how they worked, and support the explanation with specific examples such as the Enabling Act, Kristallnacht or the Wannsee Conference. In source questions start by summarising the source's content, then consider its provenance: who produced it, when and why? Use this to assess usefulness or reliability, but always back up assertions with your own contextual knowledge. For interpretation questions compare the viewpoints carefully, considering how perspective, purpose and evidence lead to different conclusions; discuss strengths and limitations before reaching a balanced judgement. Time management is essential: read the question carefully, plan a brief structure, and leave a few minutes to check spelling, punctuation and specialist terms. Finally, remember to relate every answer back to the question and to use specific evidence — names, dates, places and examples — to support your arguments. This approach shows the examiner clear knowledge, analytical thinking and the ability to reach reasoned conclusions.
