# International Relations 1890–1941 (diplomacy and war) (A-level History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: the age of alliances, crises and breakdown
International relations between 1890 and 1941 cover the slide from great-power competition through total war and into the era of aggressive dictatorships. The period begins with the end of Bismarck’s system and the emergence of more openly competitive imperial policies, proceeds through the crisis-driven politics that produced the First World War, moves into the fragile settlement of 1919–1935 and ends with the failure of collective security, the expansion of aggression by Germany, Italy and Japan, and the outbreak of global war. Students should treat the period as a connected narrative of decision-making: how long-term structural factors (industrialisation, empire, alliance systems, arms races) interacted with short-term choices by leaders, accidents and domestic pressures to produce both crisis and accommodation. Understanding the interplay between diplomacy, public opinion, economics and military capability is central to answering questions on Y218.

## Long-term causes to 1914: alliances, arms races and imperial rivalry
By 1890 Europe’s balance of power was shifting. The dismissal of Bismarck (1890) and his careful network of understandings left a vacuum that rival states filled by more muscular diplomacy. Germany’s Weltpolitik and naval expansion under Kaiser Wilhelm II provoked Britain’s naval reactions; the Anglo‑German naval race of the early twentieth century intensified mutual fear. On the Continent, the formation of the Triple Entente (France, Russia, Britain) opposite the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria‑Hungary, Italy) created an environment in which local crises could escalate into general war. Imperial competition produced flashpoints: the Moroccan Crises (1905 and 1911) tested Franco‑German relations and revealed the limits of compromise; the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) unsettled south‑eastern Europe and undermined Austro‑Hungarian authority. Nationalism, particularly among Slavic peoples in the Balkans, combined with militarism and detailed war plans (Schlieffen Plan, Russian partial mobilisation plans) to make contingency fall into catastrophe. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo (28 June 1914) became the immediate trigger, but the crisis logic of rigid alliances, mobilisations and diplomatic ultimatums turned a regional incident into a European conflagration by August 1914.

## The First World War and the remaking of diplomacy
The First World War transformed diplomacy: it was fought not only by generals but by economies, populations and allied coalitions. Trench warfare, industrialised slaughter and global naval campaigns produced unprecedented casualties and economic dislocation, and the entry of the United States in 1917 shifted the balance decisively. The war’s diplomatic outcome was shaped in 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference where the victorious powers—principally Britain, France, the United States and Italy—negotiated treaties that reconfigured borders, created new states, and attempted to punish or contain the defeated Central Powers. The Treaty of Versailles (28 June 1919) imposed heavy reparations and territorial losses on Germany, while creating new security dilemmas. Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points and the ideal of a League of Nations promised a new order, but the American Senate’s refusal to ratify the League covenant limited its authority. The wartime experience and the peace settlement left a legacy of grievance, revisionist aspirations and unresolved minorities, all of which would shadow the interwar years.

## The League, 1919–1935: hopes, achievements and limits
The League of Nations represented the highest hopes for a rules-based international order based on collective security and arbitration of disputes. Its early achievements included settling several minor territorial disputes, overseeing mandates, and tackling humanitarian and economic questions. Diplomatic forums such as the Washington Naval Conference (1921–22) and the Locarno Treaties (1925) suggested that limited arms control and reconciliation were possible: Locarno, in particular, normalised Germany’s western borders and promoted the spirit of cooperation in the late 1920s. The Kellogg‑Briand Pact (1928) renounced war as national policy in principle, though it lacked enforcement mechanisms. Yet the League’s capacity depended on the will of its leading members and the absence of great‑power unanimity. The United States’ non‑membership, the persistence of economic nationalism and a rising tide of authoritarianism exposed the League to strategic limits. When crises came—Manchuria in 1931 and Abyssinia in 1935—the League’s inability to impose meaningful sanctions, or to halt aggression when major powers sheltered aggressors, fatally undermined its credibility.

## The 1930s: economic collapse, dictators and the collapse of collective security
The Great Depression from 1929 weakened democratic states economically and politically, eroding public confidence in liberal institutions and empowering extremist movements that promised national revival. Italy’s 1935 invasion of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) revealed the impotence of collective sanctions and produced the Hoare‑Laval episode, which discredited British and French firmness. Germany’s remilitarisation under Hitler—rearmament, withdrawal from the League and the repudiation of Versailles clauses—was coupled with aggressive diplomacy: reoccupation of the Rhineland (1936), support for Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), the Anschluss with Austria (March 1938) and pressure on Czechoslovakia over the Sudetenland. Mussolini’s ambitions led to alignment with Germany by the late 1930s. These developments were not inevitable; different domestic constraints and international responses might have checked them. But the practical constraints of British and French politics—war weariness, financial limitations, and the fear of provoking a new general war—encouraged policies of restraint.

## Appeasement, Munich and the road to general war
Appeasement became the dominant western response to some aspects of German revisionism. It rested on several calculations: some British and French leaders believed that Germany had legitimate grievances from Versailles; many doubted that Britain and France were militarily ready for a continental war; public opinion was hostile to another large conflict. The Munich Agreement (September 1938), which allowed German annexation of the Sudetenland, symbolised appeasement’s high point. For contemporaries and for later historians the debate is stark: to critics, Munich was a capitulation that encouraged further aggression; to defenders, it bought time for rearmament and avoided war when Britain was not prepared. The subsequent German occupation of the remainder of Czechoslovakia (March 1939) exposed the limits of appeasement and disabused many that Hitler’s aims were merely revisionist. The signing of the Nazi‑Soviet Pact (Molotov‑Ribbentrop) in August 1939 shocked Europe and removed the prospect of a two‑front struggle for Germany, clearing the diplomatic path to the invasion of Poland and war in September 1939. From that point diplomatic failure turned rapidly into military conflagration across Europe.

## The Far East: Japanese expansion and the wider conflict to 1941
Parallel to European crises Japan pursued imperial expansion in East Asia. The Manchurian Incident of 1931 and the establishment of the puppet state Manchukuo signalled Japan’s willingness to use force and to flout the League. Full‑scale war with China from 1937 (the Marco Polo Bridge Incident) demonstrated both Japan’s ambitions and the brutal nature of the conflict. Japanese militarism was driven by resource needs, nationalist ideology and a desire to dominate East Asia. Western responses were constrained: the United States, entrenched in isolationist sentiment through the 1930s, used diplomatic protests and economic sanctions as its main instruments. British and French imperial preoccupations limited their options. As Japan advanced into Indo‑China in 1940–41, the United States and Britain increasingly resorted to embargoes, most importantly cutting Japanese access to oil and scrap metal. Those embargoes, together with strategic calculations made in Tokyo, contributed directly to the decision to attack Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and to bring the United States fully into global war, thereby transforming the conflict yet again into a truly worldwide struggle.

## Interpreting 1890–1941: frameworks and debates
Students should be comfortable with competing interpretations. Some historians stress structural causes—economic rivalry, the alliance system, and the security dilemma—while others emphasise contingency, leadership choices and misperception. Debates about appeasement hinge on whether it was a rational attempt to buy time or a moral and strategic mistake that permitted Nazi strength. The role of Versailles is contested: did its harshness make revision inevitable, or did it merely create an argument that aggressive leaders exploited? Similarly, the League’s weaknesses can be read as institutional failures or as the result of great-power unwillingness to use force. Good essays will weigh evidence, compare explanations and recognise the limits of single-factor explanations. Use specific episodes—Morocco, Manchuria, Abyssinia, Munich, the Nazi‑Soviet Pact and Pearl Harbor—as case studies to test broader claims about diplomacy and war.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on International Relations 1890–1941 requires chronological command, conceptual precision and balanced argument. For a two‑part non‑British period paper (the format for Y218) expect a shorter 10‑mark question requiring a comparative judgement on the relative importance of two factors, followed by a 20‑mark essay demanding analysis and evaluation of causes or significance. For the shorter question identify quickly the two factors, state a clear comparative judgement in the first paragraph, and devote roughly 20–25 minutes to a concise answer that uses two or three well‑evidenced points for each factor and concludes with a clear assessment. For the 20‑mark essay plan an introduction that outlines your argument and the criteria you will use to judge significance; use the body to develop two to four sustained analytical points supported by precise examples and link each paragraph explicitly back to the question. Reserve a short conclusion that weighs the evidence and reaches a balanced judgement.

When answering interpretation or source‑based questions, place texts in context, identify the source‑writer’s perspective and purpose, assess provenance and use specific factual knowledge to corroborate or challenge their claims. Always differentiate between AO1 (knowledge), AO2 (use of sources) and AO3 (interpretations) and make sure your answer addresses the required objective. Time management matters: in a one‑hour paper allocate time in proportion to marks and leave a few minutes for proofing. Use dates and named treaties, conferences and leaders to show command of the narrative, but avoid narrative for its own sake—analysis and evaluation are rewarded most highly. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions and build synoptic answers that connect diplomatic episodes to wider developments such as economic pressures, domestic politics and technological change.
