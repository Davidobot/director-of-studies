# Making of England 871–1016 (Alfred and the Vikings) (A-level History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: the period and big questions
The period 871–1016 charts the extraordinary transformation of small Anglo-Saxon polities into a kingdom we can reasonably call England. That transformation was driven by sustained encounter and conflict with Viking forces, the responses of rulers at Wessex and their neighbours, and changes in administration, law and culture that bound territories together. The central narrative begins with Alfred of Wessex, whose reign (871–899) is often presented as decisive in saving Anglo‑Saxon monarchy from collapse. But the making of England was a century-long process: Alfred’s military, administrative and cultural reforms set patterns that his successors—Edward the Elder, Aethelflaed of the Mercians, Athelstan, Edmund, Eadred and Edgar—used to extend royal control, while the later crises of Aethelred’s reign show how fragile unity could be when confronted by renewed Scandinavian pressure. Revision should focus on cause and consequence: why did the Vikings succeed and then settle? How did the English rulers create lasting institutions? Was Alfred a founder or a skilful survivor whose reputation was later enhanced?

## Alfred and the Viking threat: context and immediate responses
Viking activity in the late eighth and ninth centuries began as raiding, motivated by a mixture of economic gain, political opportunity and the mobility of maritime societies in Scandinavia. Monasteries and coastal settlements were attractive targets; monasteries like Lindisfarne became emblematic of this violence. By the time of Alfred’s accession in 871, the Great Heathen Army had already begun a sustained campaign of conquest and settlement. Alfred’s reputation rests on a number of pivotal moments: his leadership during early defeats and retreats, the refuge at Athelney, and his ultimate check on the Great Heathen Army culminating in treaties that left the English south and west intact while much of the north and east slipped into Scandinavian control. The later return of Viking forces in the 890s under different leaders required renewed strategy. Understanding Alfred’s responses helps explain how Wessex remained the nucleus for future English unity.

## Military and administrative innovation: burhs, fyrd and naval change
A clear feature of Alfred’s reign was the remaking of defence. He is associated with the construction and formal organisation of burhs—fortified towns with economic as well as military functions—systematised in documents such as the Burghal Hidage. These defended centres, placed at strategic intervals, were linked by a network that made rapid response possible and undermined the Vikings’ ability to live off the land. Alfred also reformed the fyrd, the levy system, introducing rotations so that a standing element could defend the realm and another work the fields. The notion of a naval response to seaborne raiding has become part of Alfredian legend; while modern scholars debate how innovative the naval reforms were, there is good evidence of increased maritime activity and counter‑raiding. Importantly, the burhs were not only military works: they stimulated local economies, fostered markets and encouraged the extension of royal authority into the shires. Together, these measures show a move from reactive defence to systematic territorial control.

## Alfredian culture, law and kingship
Alfred’s programme for learning and religion—the so-called Alfredian Renaissance—served both practical and ideological ends. Alfred promoted Latin and vernacular learning, encouraged translations of key texts (or patronised them), and fostered ecclesiastical and clerical education. Asser’s Life of King Alfred (a contemporary source but attentive to royal propaganda) presents literacy and law as linked: learning reinforced legitimate kingship. Alfred’s law code draws on earlier Anglo‑Saxon and biblical traditions but marks attempts to bind diverse communities under royal justice. The rhetoric of Alfred as “King of the English” and the use of literature and law to create a shared identity are central to debates about whether cultural revival was a cause or an effect of political consolidation. Students should weigh Asser and the Chronicle against material evidence for literacy, coinage and administrative practice.

## The extension of kingship, 899–975: Edward, Aethelflaed, Athelstan and Edgar
After Alfred, his successors pursued expansion and consolidation rather than radical innovation. Edward the Elder and his sister Aethelflaed of Mercia campaigned against Scandinavian settlements, took strategic towns, and secured submissions from neighbouring rulers; these campaigns have been described as the 'conquest of the Danelaw'. Athelstan (924–939) is particularly important: by 927 he captured York and, after Brunanburh in 937, could claim a dominance across Britain that reverberated in contemporary praise-poetry. His legal codes and court structures show a king operating with a broader administrative footprint: magnates, ealdormen and the developing royal council were central. Edgar (959–975) consolidated institutions further: reforms in local government, patronage of monastic reform, improvements in coinage and ceremonial—his coronation in 973 was presented as the crowning of a united England. Together these reigns illustrate evolution from survival to territorial statehood, but they also depended on negotiated authority with local elites and ecclesiastical structures.

## Aethelred, Danegeld and the limits of English unity to 1016
The later decades of the period show the limits of the systems Alfred and his successors developed. Aethelred the Unready’s reign (978–1016) was marred by renewed Scandinavian violence and political divisions at home. The murder of Edward the Martyr, the return of Viking leaders and the rising prominence of figures such as Sweyn Forkbeard and later Cnut show how dynastic weakness and faction could undermine a kingdom built on negotiated lordship. The payment of Danegeld, the 991 treaty with the Duke of Normandy, the battle of Maldon and the rise of Scandinavian power culminating in conquest under Cnut reflect shifts in military balance and the international dimension of English kingship. Aethelred’s legislative activity—multiple law codes and monetary reforms—demonstrates attempts at governance, but they were unable to prevent the loss of effective independence by the end of the period. These years are crucial in understanding state fragility: institutions matter, but political cohesion and military capacity were equally decisive.

## Sources, interpretation and historiographical points to remember
Studying this period requires careful use of difficult sources. The Anglo‑Saxon Chronicle, Asser’s Life, law codes, charters, coinage and archaeological evidence each carry strengths and weaknesses. Asser writes as a courtier with a pro‑Alfred agenda; the Chronicle is a compilation produced in different places and times and reflects local biases. Charters and the Burghal Hidage offer administrative detail but are often formulaic. Archaeology (fortifications, coin finds, burh layouts) provides material checks on textual claims. Historians differ in emphasis: some stress Alfred’s active innovation and regard him as the founder of England; others see continuity with earlier Anglo‑Saxon practices and emphasize the role of later rulers in achieving unity. When reviewing interpretations, consider provenance, intent and audience: Asser promotes royal ideology; later medieval chroniclers retrospectively magnified Alfred’s role. Use a mixture of narrative, institutional and socio-economic approaches to build balanced interpretations.

## Exam technique
This unit is examined in two linked parts: a source‑based enquiry (AO2) and a period essay (AO1). Time allocation should reflect marks: roughly three fifths of the time on the source task and two fifths on the essay. Start the source question by restating the question in your own words and signposting your approach. Establishing provenance is essential: date, origin, purpose and audience shape how a source should be judged. For each source, combine short contextual knowledge (what was happening at the time) with specific analysis (tone, emphasis, omissions) and then compare sources against each other. Don’t treat provenance as a formula—provenance should feed directly into your evaluation of reliability and usefulness. Organise the answer so that comparison and synthesis come before a concise concluding assessment about the extent to which the sources support or challenge the historic claim.

For the essay, open with a clear thesis that answers the question and outlines the main lines of argument. Each paragraph should tackle a distinct angle—military developments, administrative change, ecclesiastical influence, or comparative actions of rulers—and should combine evidence (dates, battles like Brunanburh, institutions like burhs, documents such as the Burghal Hidage or law codes) with analysis of consequence. Always assess change and continuity across the period and weigh counter-arguments: for example, if you argue for Alfred’s centrality, acknowledge later rulers’ roles and the limits of early reforms. Use specific examples not only as illustration but as analytical leverage: explain why the capture of York in 927 mattered for royal authority; explain how burhs altered economies as well as defence. Finish with a judgement that synthesises the evidence and explains why you reached that conclusion.

Finally, practice planning under timed conditions and learn a small set of well‑rehearsed exemplar facts and quotations (from law codes, Chronicle entries, and familiar secondary interpretations) that you can deploy flexibly. Examiners reward clarity of argument, careful use of evidence and evaluation of sources and interpretations—remember that historical explanation and judgement are the core aims of the unit.
