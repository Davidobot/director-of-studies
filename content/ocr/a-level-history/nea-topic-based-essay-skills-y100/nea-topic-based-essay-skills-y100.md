# NEA: Topic-based essay skills (Y100) (A-level History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What the NEA is for and why it matters
The Topic based essay (Unit Y100) is your opportunity to practise history as historians practise it: to frame a question, gather evidence, engage with other scholars’ arguments and reach your own substantiated judgement. The task is an independently researched essay of 3,000–4,000 words and is internally assessed by your centre and externally moderated by OCR. It is designed to assess the full range of skills that A-level History values: the use of knowledge to make reasoned argument (AO1), the critical analysis of sources in their context (AO2) and the evaluation of historians’ interpretations (AO3). Within the A-level this unit is synoptic: it asks you to bring together skills and knowledge from across your studies and to demonstrate that you can carry out a principled piece of historical enquiry from start to finish.

## Choosing a question and using the Title(s) Proposal tool
Your title should set a clear historical issue or problem to be investigated and should invite analysis of differing perspectives. You choose your own title but the centre must submit it to OCR for approval using the Title(s) Proposal tool; you should not begin detailed research until OCR has confirmed approval. The usual deadline for submitting titles is 31 January in the year of assessment, and centres must submit titles each series even if very similar titles have previously been approved. The best titles are neither too broad nor too narrow: they should allow you to marshal several lines of primary and secondary evidence and to evaluate contrasting interpretations. The question must not duplicate any of the three depth-study interpretation topics you studied in your unit group 3 option, and centres must ensure that candidates’ titles are genuinely independent and not derived from pre-prepared source packs.

## Planning, research and the selection of sources and interpretations
Good planning transforms a promising question into a successful essay. Begin by clarifying the question in a short paragraph that sets out what you mean by key terms and the timescale or geographical limits you will use. Produce a research plan that schedules time for locating primary sources, reading key secondary works, taking notes, drafting and revising. The specification expects a “range” of sources and interpretations, typically ten to fifteen items in total. Of these, at least four primary sources and at least four interpretations must be evaluated in depth if you aim for the highest marks. Your choices should be appropriate to the question: contemporary documents, printed pamphlets, letters, government records, newspapers, visual material or quantitative data can all be valuable primary material; secondary works should include major scholarly debates and a mix of older and more recent interpretations so that you can show awareness of historiographical development.

When selecting material be alert to the danger of convenience sampling. Use library catalogues, trusted digital archives, and university or national collections rather than relying solely on unsourced internet pages. Centres may suggest where to look for material and help with access, but they must not supply pre-selected compilations of sources or detailed guidance specific to a candidate’s draft. Keep full bibliographic details as you go so that referencing and a bibliography can be provided with the final submission.

## Working with sources and interpretations: how to evaluate and use them
Evaluating primary sources means treating them as both evidence and historical objects. For each source you should explain provenance (who produced it, when and why), content (what it says), and context (the circumstances in which it was produced). From this you can judge reliability (is it accurate on matters of fact?), utility (what can it usefully tell us about your question?), partiality (what is it likely to omit or distort?) and corroboration (how does it fit with other evidence?). When possible, connect a source’s features to the wider political, social or cultural context to show why it was produced in a particular form or language. A balanced evaluation will combine close reading of individual documents with comparison across sources so that your assessment is grounded in evidence rather than assertion.

Evaluating interpretations has a parallel logic but different ends. For each historian or interpretation you analyse the argument (what claim is being made), the evidence used (what sources and methods), the date and intellectual context (how the historian’s time and perspective shape the account), and the strengths and limitations of the argument. Locate the interpretation within a historiographical conversation: is it revisionist, traditional, Marxist, cultural, post-colonial, or influenced by another approach? You should use interpretation-evaluation not as a separate exercise but woven into your argument: show how particular interpretations illuminate or misrepresent aspects of your question, and then weigh them against the primary evidence. A strong essay will go beyond description of historians’ views to explain why one interpretation is more convincing in light of the evidence and why others are limited.

## Structuring your essay and sustaining an argument
Structure is where clarity of thought meets examiner expectations. A successful essay typically has a concise introduction that states the question in your words, identifies the criteria you will use to judge it, outlines the structure of the argument and signals your historiographical approach. Each main paragraph should start with a clear point that contributes directly to your overall argument, then be supported by precise evidence and linked to evaluation of sources and/or interpretations. Use signposting sentences to make the logical movement clear: a paragraph should not be purely narrative, nor a string of quoted material, but a mini-argument that advances your case.

Balance is crucial. AO1 rewards well-selected factual knowledge used to analyse and evaluate the issue, so depth of argument matters more than length. Avoid long, unsupported narrative detours. Introduce historiography at the points where it matters most: bring in an interpretation when it provides an explanatory lens or when you need to show how historians have disagreed. Reserve the final section for a conclusion that directly addresses the question, weighs the evidence and interpretations, and offers a substantiated judgement that acknowledges complexity rather than offering a simplistic verdict.

## Teacher support, drafting, authentication and academic integrity
Teachers should provide general guidance about the task, assessment criteria and research methods, and they may review an early draft to help you understand what is required. However, support must remain at a general level: teachers may not provide detailed line-by-line corrections, nor may they give specific wording or substantially rework a candidate’s text. The JCQ and OCR rules allow one review of an earlier draft to help you understand how to meet the criteria; after that, your work must be your own. Centres must authenticate each learner’s submitted work using the appropriate form and must be ready to explain how they ensured independence. Plagiarism, copying from other students, or submitting material prepared by others will be treated as malpractice and the work will lose credit. Keep careful records of the sources you consulted and include full references and a bibliography so that examiners can see the provenance of your evidence.

## Marking, moderation and what examiners look for
The NEA is marked against AO1 (knowledge and argument), AO2 (analysis of sources) and AO3 (evaluation of interpretations). Within the 40 marks available for the unit, AO1 accounts for 20 marks, AO2 for 10 marks and AO3 for 10 marks. Examiners expect a clear focus on the question, well-selected and accurate factual knowledge, and an argument that reaches a substantiated judgement supported by evidence. For AO2 and AO3 the highest bands require detailed, convincing evaluation: at least four appropriate primary sources and four fully appropriate interpretations should be evaluated to reach the top levels. Centres submit a sample of scripts for moderation either electronically (moderated upload) or by post (moderated postal); the method you use must be indicated on entries. If a candidate is retaking the A-level, it is possible to carry forward the earlier NEA mark instead of re-submitting, but the centre must select the correct carry-forward entry code at entry.

## Practical final steps and common pitfalls to avoid
Compliance with formal requirements is as important as the argument itself. The essay must be between 3,000 and 4,000 words; adhere to this range. Include a title page that gives your question, word count and a declaration of independence, plus a clear bibliography. Number pages and use consistent referencing; examiners are not prescriptive about a single referencing system but they do expect accuracy and the ability to locate items you cite. Do not add or remove material after you have submitted the final work for assessment: once you hand in the final submission it must not be revised. Avoid the common pitfalls of overlong narrative, insufficient engagement with interpretations, poor documentation of sources and over-reliance on a narrow range of evidence. If you are uncertain about the suitability of a particular source or title, consult your teacher and remember that OCR will check titles and may ask for clarification before approval.

## Exam technique
Treat the NEA as an extended exam essay carried out with time to research, draft and refine rather than as an open-ended project. Plan backward from the submission deadline: allocate time for title approval, archival searches or library loans, careful note-taking, drafting, and at least one substantive redraft after teacher feedback. In the writing itself aim for precision and economy: each paragraph should advance your argument and be supported by evidence and evaluation. Where you use quotes, keep them brief and always analyse them rather than letting them stand as proof. Integrate source and interpretation evaluation into the argument so that your essay reads as a coherent piece of historical reasoning rather than a set of separate analytical exercises. Finally, before submission check the formal criteria: word count, bibliography, authentication, and that at least four sources and four interpretations are evaluated in depth if you are aiming for the top bands. A well-structured, evidence-driven and properly authenticated essay will show examiners you can think, research and write like a historian.
