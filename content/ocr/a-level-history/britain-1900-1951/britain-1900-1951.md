# Britain 1900–1951: politics, society and war (A-level History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: a period of rupture and reconstruction
The years 1900–1951 cover a dramatic half-century in which Britain moved from a confident imperial power with an established party system into a state transformed by two world wars, economic crisis and a new welfare settlement. The period is best read as a sequence of shocks and responses: the Liberal social reforms of the early twentieth century, the mass violence and mobilisation of the First World War, the dislocations of the interwar economy and politics, the existential struggle of the Second World War and the reconstruction that followed. These decades saw the expansion of political participation, the decline of the Liberal Party and the rise of Labour as one of the two main parties, the growth of state intervention in welfare and the economy, and a redefinition of Britain’s role in the world as empire came under pressure. When revising, think in terms of causes and consequences, continuities and turning points, and the ways in which war accelerated social and political change.

## Party politics and the shifting balance of power
At the start of the century British politics was dominated by the Conservatives and Liberals, with the Conservatives appealing to landowners, business and much of the professional middle class, and the Liberals championing free trade and social reform. The high point of Liberal power came in 1906, but internal pressures and the strains of coalition government during the First World War weakened them. The crucial realignment occurred between 1918 and 1924: the franchise extension after 1918 enfranchised millions and, together with social change, produced an electorate that the newly organised Labour Party could attract. Labour formed minority governments in 1924 and a more substantial one in 1929, demonstrating that it had replaced the Liberals as the principal alternative to Conservatism. The Conservatives dominated much of the 1920s and 1930s, often through coalition arrangements, most notably the National Government formed in 1931 to confront economic crisis. During the Second World War a wartime coalition under Churchill blurred party lines at the top, but after 1945 Labour under Clement Attlee won a decisive victory, reflecting public appetite for reconstruction, social security and full employment. When revising party politics, map the causes of party decline and growth: class alignment, the franchise, organisation, and the impact of war and economic policy on voting behaviour.

## Social policy before 1914 and the emergence of a welfare state
Social reform before 1914 laid important foundations. From 1906 onwards the Liberal government introduced measures aimed at poverty prevention and social insurance. Reforms such as free school meals, medical inspections, the old age pension and the National Insurance Acts of 1911 created new expectations about what the state should do for citizens. These measures were limited in scope but significant in principle: they signalled state responsibility for social risks and helped normalise collective provision. The idea that the state might take a central role in health, unemployment and pensions matured through the experience of total war: wartime planning, rationing and mobilisation demonstrated the state’s capacity and created public demands for security after the conflict. Revision should emphasise how incremental Liberal reforms combined with the experience of war to change political rhetoric and popular expectations.

## Economy and society in the interwar years
The interwar decades were shaped by the economic consequences of the First World War and by the global Great Depression. Britain struggled to convert a wartime economy to peacetime prosperity, with heavy debts, a competitive international environment and industrial regions (notably coal, shipbuilding and textiles) experiencing chronic decline. Unemployment became both a social problem and a political issue, peaking in the early 1930s and concentrating regionally in the industrial North and Wales. Political responses included protective tariffs after 1931, public works and limited rearmament later in the decade. The General Strike of 1926 remains emblematic of industrial conflict and the limits of co-operation between labour and state; the success and failures of trade unions and the Labour movement shaped the politics of the era. At the same time, social life was changing: consumer goods spread unevenly, leisure culture developed, and urban housing and health standards slowly improved. For revision, link economic trends to political consequences: how industrial decline weakened certain social coalitions, how economic distress influenced voting, and how the experience of mass unemployment informed post‑war thinking about full employment.

## Britain between appeasement and war: foreign policy and rearmament
Foreign policy between the wars was a contested field. A mixture of pacifist sentiment after 1918, the burdens of empire, economic constraints and misjudgement produced a policy of limited response to Nazi Germany in the 1930s. The policy of appeasement—most visible in the Munich Agreement of 1938—was driven by the desire to avoid another catastrophic war and by assumptions about the balance of power in Europe. At the same time, the rearmament programme that gathered pace from the mid-1930s transformed industry and employment and altered public perceptions of state priorities. When studying this period, balance critique of appeasement with consideration of the constraints policymakers faced: public opinion, fiscal limits, the legacy of the First World War, and the belief that the Versailles settlement had to be revised.

## Total war and the transformation of society, 1939–1945
The Second World War was a crucible of social and governmental change. The wartime coalition government mobilised the economy on a colossal scale: conscription, rationing, central planning and the direction of industry underlined the state’s new role. The Home Front saw women enter industrial and military roles in unprecedented numbers, transforming gender relations and fueling post-war demands for equality and recognition. Bombing and evacuation reshaped urban life and family structures, while civil defence and shared sacrifice fostered a sense of national community. Politically, the war produced unity at the top but also intensified expectations for post-war reconstruction. The Beveridge Report of 1942 captured wartime ambitions for a comprehensive welfare settlement to tackle the ‘five giants’ of want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness. When revising the wartime period, connect administrative innovations and social experience to the political consensus that made the post‑war welfare state possible.

## Reconstruction 1945–1951: Attlee’s mandate and the shaped welfare state
The 1945 general election returned a Labour government with a strong mandate to transform Britain. The Attlee administration moved rapidly to institutionalise the wartime promise of social security. The key legislative achievements included the establishment of the National Health Service and the expansion of social security through the National Insurance Acts, together with the nationalisation of major industries such as coal, railways and utilities. The 1944 Butler Education Act (passed under a wartime coalition) was implemented to reshape education, and extensive council house building aimed to tackle wartime housing shortages. Yet these reforms were implemented amid austerity: the economy confronted balance-of-payments problems, continued rationing into the late 1940s, and the costs of maintaining an imperial role. The loss of India in 1947 and pressure on sterling underscored limits to Britain’s global ambitions. Revision should assess both the transformative achievements—universal health care and social insurance—and the constraints under which they were delivered: economic shortages, continued rationing, and geopolitical retrenchment.

## Interpreting change: long-term consequences and debates
The period invites several interpretative debates useful in essays. Was the welfare state a radical break with the past or a culmination of earlier reforms? Many historians argue it combined continuity (building on Liberal reforms and voluntary mutual aid) with radical institutional change (universal, state-funded health care). Another debate concerns the causes of Labour’s 1945 victory: was it wartime coalition leadership, the appeal of Beveridge’s vision, or long‑term social and partisan realignment? Similarly, assessments of interwar foreign policy vary between those who emphasise appeasement as moral and strategic failure and those who stress realistic constraints. When revising, practise weighing evidence for different interpretations and linking short-term events to long-term social and political structures.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on Britain 1900–1951 requires a balance of factual precision, argument, and contextual understanding. For essays, begin with a concise thesis that directly addresses the question and indicates the line of argument. Structure the response in clear paragraphs that each make a single point supported by evidence, analysis and linking sentences that tie the paragraph back to the question. Use specific examples—legislation, dates, events, key figures, and social statistics where appropriate—to substantiate claims, but avoid relying on isolated facts without analysis. For source-based enquiry questions, practise placing each source in its historical context, assessing provenance and purpose, and comparing its content with your own knowledge to test hypotheses. When evaluating interpretations, identify the historian’s argument, the evidence they use, and any assumptions; then compare interpretations and explain why one might be more convincing while showing awareness of legitimate counter‑arguments. Manage time: allocate minutes proportionally to marks available, plan each answer with a brief outline, and leave time to write a succinct conclusion that reiterates your judgement. Finally, explicitly use the command words in the question—explain, assess, evaluate, compare—to shape your response, and remember to include synoptic links: draw connections across periods (for instance, linking Liberal reforms with Attlee’s welfare state) to demonstrate breadth as well as depth.
