# Source analysis and evaluation (OCR source-based enquiries) (A-level History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What OCR expects from source-based enquiries
Source-based enquiries sit at the heart of A‑level History (H505). You will be tested on three distinct but related skills: knowledge and argument (AO1), the analysis and evaluation of contemporary source material (AO2) and the analysis and evaluation of historical interpretations (AO3). Across the full A‑level these are weighted so that AO1 carries the largest share of marks, with AO2 and AO3 each contributing significant but smaller proportions; the Topic based essay (unit Y100) requires you to use all three AOs together in a sustained piece of independent research. In the British period study and enquiry paper (unit group 1) Section A is explicitly a source enquiry worth 30 marks and assessed against AO2. In the thematic unit (unit group 3) the interpretation question is assessed against AO3 while the long thematic essays test AO1. Understanding the distinct demands of each objective is the first step to answering source-based questions effectively.

## How the enquiry paper is organised and how to allocate your time
The British period study and enquiry paper is 1 hour 30 minutes long. Section A, the enquiry, requires analysis and evaluation of four sources in order to test a hypothesis; it is worth 30 marks. Section B is a 20‑mark period essay. To manage your time, plan to spend around fifty to fifty‑five minutes on Section A and thirty‑five to forty minutes on Section B. This gives you time to read the sources carefully, plan structured paragraphs that address the question directly and use precise contextual knowledge where it strengthens your evaluation. Practising under timed conditions will help you find the pace that works for you, but remember that quality of analysis is more important than quantity: a tightly argued response that addresses provenance, content and cross‑comparison will outscore a long paraphrase of the sources.

## Practical approach to analysing primary sources (AO2)
AO2 requires you to treat sources as evidence: to probe their origin and purpose, to assess what they tell you and what they leave out, and to judge how far they support or undermine the proposition in the question. Start with a short introduction that paraphrases the question and sets out your plan: this anchors your answer and shows you understand the enquiry. Each source deserves focused treatment. For each one, establish provenance first: state plainly who produced it, when and where, and their likely position or interest. A fifteenth‑century chronicle written by a court cleric will have very different priorities from a private letter by a soldier or a government proclamation. Use provenance to suggest likely bias, perspective and reliability; for example, a minister’s dispatch to the crown may be intended to justify policy and therefore overstate successes.

After provenance, analyse the content. Identify the source’s main claims and tone, and comment on what specific details it offers. Don’t merely paraphrase: interrogate the language. If a source uses emotive language or categorical judgments, explain how that affects its reliability for the question. Then place the source in its wider historical context by using targeted AO1 knowledge: a few well‑chosen facts that show you understand the events, structures or debates relevant to the source will strengthen your evaluation. Contextual knowledge should be used to challenge or corroborate the source’s claims rather than to write an undirected mini‑essay.

Cross‑comparison is essential. You must explain how sources relate to one another: do they corroborate, contradict or illuminate different aspects of the issue? Where two sources disagree, explain why they might do so — differences of social position, intended audience, the moment of composition or differing aims will often account for conflicting testimony. Finally, comment on utility and limitations: say how far the source is useful for answering the question and point to specific gaps or distortions. Conclude the enquiry with a short synthesis that weighs the evidence across the four sources and reaches a balanced judgement about the question.

A worked example helps. Suppose the enquiry asks whether a king’s military leadership secured victory in a campaign. A contemporary annal by court clerics praising royal strategy should be treated as valuable for its immediacy but limited by its audience and political motive. A captured enemy officer’s report might offer a different angle on logistics and morale. A later chronicle compiled decades after the event brings useful compilation but risks retrospective myth‑making. Showing these distinctions, and using a couple of secure facts about the campaign to test each source, converts description into evaluation.

## How to analyse and evaluate interpretations (AO3)
AO3 asks you to interrogate historians’ interpretations: to explain what each interpretation argues, to identify the evidence and assumptions behind it, to locate it within wider historiographical debate, and to judge which interpretation is more convincing. Start by paraphrasing each extract succinctly: what is the historian claiming? Then examine the basis of the claim. Is the historian using political, social, economic or cultural evidence? Is the argument shaped by an ideological stance such as Marxism, liberalism, revisionism or a post‑revisionist synthesis? A historian arguing that social forces drove change will tend to foreground class evidence; another who stresses contingency will highlight personalities and chance.

Next, bring in contextual knowledge to test the argument. This is not a recital of facts but a selective challenge: use concrete evidence to undermine or support the interpretation. Point to counter‑examples or to documentary threads the historian omits. Consider authorial proximity: a twentieth‑century academic drawing on state archives will approach a topic differently from a contemporary partisan writer. When asked to judge which interpretation is more convincing, set out explicit criteria for your verdict — breadth of evidence, plausibility, explanatory power, acknowledgement of complexity — and apply them. A balanced conclusion recognises the strengths and weaknesses of both views and explains why one provides a better explanation of the historical problem.

Comparative questions frequently reward candidates who go beyond surface language and identify the historian’s methodology and use of sources. Be precise about what “convincing” means in context: an interpretation that explains a wide range of phenomena coherently is generally more persuasive than one that fits only a narrow set of facts.

## Using AO1 knowledge effectively in source answers
AO1 underpins both AO2 and AO3: your factual knowledge, deployed selectively and precisely, gives weight to your analysis. The key is to use AO1 to illuminate evidence, not to drown the answer in background. When you bring in contextual facts, link them directly to the source under scrutiny: show how a particular charter, battle outcome, legal reform or socio‑economic trend supports or undermines the source’s claim. Avoid long narrative paragraphs about the entire period. Examiners reward candidates who can explain relevance: why does this fact matter for evaluating this source? That focused deployment demonstrates control of AO1 and strengthens your AO2 or AO3 assessment.

In practice, prepare short packets of secure knowledge for each option you study: core dates, a handful of central events, the main political actors and the essential structural features of the period. These are the facts you will draw on to test sources and interpretations under time pressure. Learn to introduce context in a sentence or two and then return to source analysis; this balance is what higher mark bands require.

## The Topic based essay (Unit Y100): selecting and using sources and interpretations
The non‑exam assessment is an extended independent essay of 3000–4000 words and contributes 20% of the A‑level. The title must be approved by OCR via the Title(s) Proposal tool and must not duplicate any of the depth interpretation topics studied in unit group 3. The essay must be an independently researched investigation that uses a range of primary and secondary material. Candidates are expected to consult broadly: a typical successful submission will have 10–15 items of evidence in total and must evaluate at least four primary sources and four historical interpretations to reach the highest mark bands. This is explicit in OCR guidance and in the marking criteria.

Plan the essay carefully. A strong introduction defines a clear question, explains its significance, locates the main historiographical debates and outlines the range of sources used. Methodology should be transparent: what kinds of sources you have chosen and why, and how you will use them to test different interpretations. Structure the body so that sections advance an argument rather than simply summarise evidence. In one section interrogate primary material: show how the sources corroborate or conflict and how provenance affects their reliability. In another section assess secondary interpretations: identify historians’ evidence and assumptions and situate them within the broader debate. The conclusion must synthesise evidence and historiography and reach a reasoned judgement that recognises complexity.

Be meticulous about academic honesty. Centres must ensure work is genuinely independent, record authentication, carry out internal standardisation and submit work for moderation by the published deadlines. Teachers may give general guidance on structure and sources but must not provide bespoke feedback on drafts that would amount to re‑writing. Learn the referencing conventions your centre asks for and keep a clear bibliography. The NEA is a demanding but excellent opportunity to demonstrate synoptic skills and a mature understanding of how historians construct arguments.

## Exam technique
Answer planning matters. For source papers, spend the first five to ten minutes reading the question and all four sources. Note who produced each source, its date and audience, and jot two or three reminders of relevant contextual facts beside each. Use that planning time to map a short answer structure: an introduction, four focused source paragraphs each with provenance/content/corroboration/limitation, a cross‑comparison paragraph and a concise conclusion. Keep sentences clear and paragraphs signposted so the examiner can follow your reasoning quickly. When comparing interpretations, state explicit criteria for “convincing” and apply them consistently.

Avoid common pitfalls. Do not treat provenance as a token paragraph and then ignore it; do not let contextual knowledge overrun the analysis; do not paraphrase sources at length without evaluation; and avoid treating interpretations as merely different wordings of the same idea. Learn to quote short, precise phrases from a source when these illuminate bias or emphasis, but avoid long quotations that take time to unpack. Finally, practise under timed conditions, review exemplar answers to internalise the level of detail required, and use the mark schemes to calibrate what constitutes a top band answer. Regular practice combined with focused factual preparation and a disciplined paragraph structure is the quickest route to improvement in source analysis and evaluation.
