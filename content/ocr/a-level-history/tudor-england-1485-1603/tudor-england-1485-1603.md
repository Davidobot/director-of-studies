# Tudor England 1485–1603 (Henry VII to Elizabeth I) (A-level History Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: the Tudor age in context
The Tudor period marks a decisive transformation in English government, religion, society and international standing. From the fragile restoration of royal authority under Henry VII, through the dynastic and religious revolutions of Henry VIII and his successors, to the settlement and uncertain stability of Elizabeth I, this era saw the English state grow in administrative reach, wrestle with the consequences of religious change, and respond repeatedly to social and economic pressures. When you revise this topic, aim to link causes and consequences across reigns: the financial and institutional legacy of one monarch often shaped the opportunities and crises faced by the next. Understanding continuity alongside change is central: the Tudors altered monarchy and church, but many local institutions—parliament, justices of the peace, town corporations—remained crucial in mediating national policy.

## Henry VII: consolidation, legitimacy and fiscal policy
Henry VII (1485–1509) came to the throne after Bosworth with a weak dynastic claim and an immediate need to secure his position. His government focused on legitimacy, control over the nobility and the restoration of royal finances. He used bonds and recognisances to bind magnates, developed the Council Learned in the Law to extract debts and enforce financial obligations, and expanded the role of justices of the peace to maintain order locally. Foreign policy was cautious and pragmatic: the treaties of Medina del Campo (1489) and Etaples (1492), the negotiation of marriage alliances, and trade agreements like the Magnus Intercursus reflected Henry’s priority to secure the dynasty rather than pursue costly wars. For exam answers, be ready to weigh Henry’s legal and financial innovations against critiques that his methods were oppressive; historians have debated whether his fiscal measures were prudent statecraft or short-term extortion. Use examples such as the handling of the pretenders Simnel and Warbeck to show the interplay of legitimacy, local power and diplomacy.

## Henry VIII and the Reformation: personality, ministers and institutional change
Henry VIII’s reign (1509–1547) is dominated by his transformation from chivalric Renaissance prince to Tudor autocrat and by the religious upheaval of the break with Rome. Before the break, the king’s government was shaped by powerful ministers—most notably Thomas Wolsey, who dominated domestic administration and foreign policy until his fall. Wolsey’s successes (administration, legal reforms, subsidy assessments) and failures (Amicable Grant, failure to secure the king’s divorce) illustrate the limits of personal power in the face of financial constraints and aristocratic pressure.

The Reformation under Henry was not a simple top-down doctrinal change but a program of institutional reconfiguration. Between the 1530s and 1540s Henry, aided by Thomas Cromwell, engineered the Acts of Supremacy and the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The crown seized monastic lands and wealth, creating short-term financial gain and long-term social effects: redistribution of property, the weakening of traditional charitable provision, and increased involvement of lay gentry in local government. Cromwell’s administrative reforms—especially the modernisation of central government and the development of Parliament as a vehicle for royal policy—are vital to understanding the later Tudors. When explaining the Reformation, balance religious motives, Henry’s dynastic needs (a male heir) and structural factors such as the crown’s fiscal pressures and the appeal of monastic property to the political nation.

## Mid-Tudor crisis: Edward VI, 1549 unrest and Mary I’s counter-reformation
The period 1547–1558 is often called the mid-Tudor crisis because of the combination of religious instability, factional politics and social unrest that followed Henry VIII’s death. Under regents for the young Edward VI, Protestant reform accelerated. The 1549 Book of Common Prayer and other measures provoked major uprisings in the provinces: the Western and Kett’s rebellions show how religious change, local grievances over enclosure and economic dislocation could combine into large-scale disorder. Somerset and Northumberland’s rivalries reveal how weak royal authority in a minority reign could magnify faction.

Mary I’s accession (1553) reversed the religious course. Her marriage to Philip II of Spain, re-imposition of papal authority and persecution of Protestants (the Marian burnings) aimed to restore Catholicism; they also provoked opposition, most famously Wyatt’s Rebellion (1554). Mary’s reign demonstrates the intertwining of foreign policy, religion and domestic legitimacy. For essays, evaluate the extent to which the mid-century turmoil was structural (population, inflation, fiscal problems) or contingent (leadership, short-term crises), using the rebellions and shifts in policy as evidence.

## Elizabeth I: settlement, government and the challenge of conformity
Elizabeth I (1558–1603) inherited a kingdom exhausted by religious oscillation and economic strain. Her religious settlement of 1559—combining the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity with a deliberately ambiguous via media—sought pragmatic stability rather than doctrinal purity. The Elizabethan Church was shaped by compromise: the Prayer Book and the episcopal structure remained, while many Puritans found the settlement unsatisfactory. Managing religious dissent, from Puritan pressure in Parliament to the Catholic threat intensified after the papal excommunication of Elizabeth (1570), required careful use of prerogative, legislation and patronage.

Elizabeth’s personal style—reticent, politically savvy, reliant on a small circle of ministers, above all William Cecil (Lord Burghley) and later Robert Cecil—created a government that blended court access, patronage and the Privy Council’s day-to-day rule. The role of Parliament grew, especially over finances and laws; Elizabeth’s reluctance to marry and settle the succession became a recurring parliamentary and political problem. When answering exam questions, show how Elizabeth’s skilful manipulation of image, ceremony and legal authority underpinned the stability of her reign even amid recurring crises.

## Foreign policy, the Armada and economic pressures
Tudor foreign policy shifted from Henry VII’s cautious diplomacy to Henry VIII’s warlike ambitions, to Elizabeth’s combination of naval assertiveness and cautious continental policy. The later sixteenth century saw England entangled in the Dutch Revolt, piracy and privateering against Spanish interests, and ultimately open war with Spain culminating in the Armada (1588). The defeat of the Armada was a significant propaganda triumph and did much to consolidate Elizabeth’s authority, but it did not end Anglo-Spanish rivalry. Economic factors underlay many foreign choices: the crown struggled with wartime finance, reliance on parliamentary subsidies and the continued problem of inflation and debasement inherited from earlier reigns. The evolving navy, English privateering figures such as Drake, and the growth of overseas trade all helped to reshape England’s international role.

For essays, explore the relationship between foreign objectives and domestic constraints: why English intervention or non-intervention mattered at different points, and how international events intensified religious and political tensions at home, for example by raising fears about Catholic plots after 1568 and after Mary Queen of Scots’ prolonged presence in England.

## Rebellion, social disorder and the Tudor state
Rebellion is a recurring theme in Tudor England. From the Cornish and Yorkshire disturbances to the large-scale Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536 and the mid-century revolts, unrest exposed the limits of central control and the importance of local grievances. The Tudor response developed over time: Henry VII and Henry VIII used legal penalties and bonds; Tudor governments increasingly relied on justices of the peace, local elites and military force to suppress unrest; Elizabeth’s regime combined selective repression with judicial and fiscal instruments. Economic changes—population growth, inflation and enclosure—help to explain much popular discontent, but religion and faction often provided the immediate spark. In essays, contextualise any single rebellion within broader economic and political trends and evaluate the effectiveness of government responses, considering whether measures restored order or created longer-term problems.

## Individuals, institutions and interpretations
Understanding the Tudor period requires attention to key individuals—Wolsey, Cromwell, Somerset, Northumberland, Mary Tudor, Elizabeth, Cecil—and to institutions such as Parliament, the Privy Council and the Church. Historians debate the relative importance of personalities versus structural forces. For instance, was the English Reformation essentially the product of Henry VIII’s personal will and court politics, or the outcome of wider European Protestant ideas, fiscal necessity and administrative capacity? When you revise, practice placing interpretations: show awareness of differing viewpoints and be ready to evaluate them against the evidence. Use primary examples—statutes, council records, proclamations and contemporary pamphlets—to balance older ‘top-down’ and newer ‘society-centred’ accounts.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on Tudor England requires a blend of factual knowledge, analytical clarity and careful use of sources and interpretations. For source-based enquiry questions, begin by reading the question carefully and identifying the exact focus: provenance (who wrote it, when, why), content (what it says), and contextual links (how it connects to known events). Always address utility and limitation: a source’s value depends on its perspective and purpose, so explain how bias, intended audience or time of writing shapes reliability. When required to evaluate several sources together, synthesise them into an argument rather than treating each in isolation; use contextual knowledge to weigh contradictions.

For essays, plan a clear argument before you write. Start with a concise thesis that directly answers the question, outline the structure, and ensure each paragraph advances the argument with specific evidence and explanation. Balance narrative with analysis: concise chronology is helpful but must serve causal or interpretative points. Use comparative language where relevant (for example, comparing Tudor monarchs’ methods of control) and conclude by summing up the judgement and reflecting on its limits.

When dealing with interpretations (AO3-style questions), identify the historian’s main claim, place it in context (is it revisionist, Marxist, Whig, religiously sympathetic?), and test it against a range of evidence. Show why an interpretation might be persuasive yet incomplete: discuss contrary evidence, alternative explanations and differing emphases.

Time management is vital. For a 90-minute paper with a 30-mark source question and a 20-mark essay, allocate time proportionally: spend a third to half the time on the source task and the remainder on the essay, leaving a few minutes to proofread. For longer papers include time for planning each essay (5–10 minutes) and for checking that your paragraphs form a coherent narrative that leads to a clear conclusion.

Finally, use precise terminology (e.g. ‘acts of supremacy’, ‘Dissolution of the Monasteries’, ‘recognisances’, ‘Privy Council’), integrate specific examples (dates, events, names) to support claims, and avoid overgeneralisation. Demonstrating that you can connect causes, consequences, continuity and change, while critically engaging with sources and interpretations, will score highly in OCR’s assessment objectives.
