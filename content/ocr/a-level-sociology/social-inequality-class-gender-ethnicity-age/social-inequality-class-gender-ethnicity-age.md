# Social inequality: class, gender, ethnicity, age (A-level Sociology Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what we mean by social inequality
Social inequality refers to the uneven distribution of resources, opportunities and outcomes across society. It is visible in who has wealth and secure employment, who lives longest, who succeeds in education and who is more likely to be stopped by the police or experience poverty. In sociology we treat inequality not simply as individual misfortune but as patterned and socially produced: class, gender, ethnicity and age are key axes along which life chances are organised. Understanding inequality means examining both the lived experiences of people and the social structures, institutions and cultural processes that produce those experiences. This topic asks you to describe patterns and trends, apply sociological theories to explain them, evaluate evidence, and consider how research methods shape the conclusions we can draw.

## Key theoretical perspectives on inequality
Theories provide different lenses for explaining why inequalities exist and how they persist. Functionalism sees societies as systems whose institutions contribute to social order; some inequalities are interpreted as serving roles in recruitment and motivation. Marxism locates inequality in the organisation of capitalism, emphasising class exploitation, ownership of the means of production, and the role of ideology in maintaining consent. Weberian approaches broaden the analysis to include class, status and party as distinct sources of inequality. Feminist theories put gender relations and patriarchy at the centre, arguing that gender inequality is structured into both private life and public institutions. New Right perspectives stress individual responsibility and market solutions, often favouring reduced state intervention. Interactionist and postmodern perspectives focus on identity, meaning and the diversity of experience, warning against over-generalised grand narratives. These perspectives are not exclusive; useful explanations often draw on multiple theories, and you will be expected to compare and evaluate them when discussing class, gender, ethnicity and age.

## Class inequalities: work, income and life chances
Class remains a foundational strand in the study of social inequality. Class differences affect employment opportunities, job security, income, housing and health. Sociologists distinguish between occupational class, economic capital, and cultural or social capital—forms of advantage that children inherit and reproduce across generations. Patterns and trends to explore include deindustrialisation, the shift to service and knowledge economies, the rise of precarious work and the persistence of low-paid work. Theoretical explanations vary: Marxists emphasise exploitation and the capitalist labour market; functionalists point to role allocation and meritocratic mechanisms; Weberians draw attention to status groups and life chances. When considering evidence, be alert to measurement issues: occupational classifications, income measures and household composition all affect how we interpret class data. Policy responses range from welfare state interventions and progressive taxation to market-based strategies such as encouraging skills and competition in education and employment. In essays link theory to concrete evidence about employment patterns, educational attainment and access to resources, and evaluate how well different theories explain contemporary class divisions.

## Gender inequalities: power, paid work and the family
Gender shapes social life from birth through careers to retirement. Key issues include the gender pay gap, occupational segregation, unequal domestic labour, patterns of violence and differences in political and corporate representation. Feminist theory offers several approaches: liberal feminists argue for legal equality and policy reforms; radical feminists emphasise patriarchal control and gendered power; socialist/Marxist feminists connect gender inequality to capitalist labour relations; intersectional feminism highlights how gender interacts with class, ethnicity, sexuality and age. Sociologists examine how socialisation, institutions such as education and the media, and laws and norms sustain gendered expectations. When assessing change, consider the expansion of women's education and labour market participation alongside persistent glass ceilings and the unequal burden of unpaid care. Analysis should also consider how policy—maternity and paternity leave, childcare provision, anti-discrimination law—shapes outcomes, and how different theories account for both continuity and change.

## Ethnicity and race: identity, disadvantage and social processes
Ethnic and racial inequalities manifest across education, employment, criminal justice, health and residential segregation. Sociological analysis distinguishes between discrimination, structural disadvantage and cultural explanations. Theories range from assimilationist perspectives that emphasise integration into mainstream institutions, to structural theories that highlight racism embedded in institutions and labour markets, to cultural explanations that focus on community norms. Contemporary approaches stress the social construction of race and ethnicity and the role of intersectionality: the experience of an ethnic minority person will differ according to class, gender and migration history. Measurement challenges are important here: ethnic categories change over time and across censuses, and official statistics (for example police-recorded crime or educational attainment data) can both reveal and obscure patterns. Examples for study can include differential attainment at school, experiences of stop-and-search, and patterns of occupational segregation. Evaluative answers should weigh the explanatory power of competing theories and consider the role of policy interventions such as equality legislation, targeted support in education, and measures to tackle institutional racism.

## Age inequalities: youth, working life and the ageing population
Age structures experience in distinctive ways. Young people face challenges around education-to-work transitions, youth unemployment and media representations that can label them as deviant. Middle-age individuals are often in their prime earning years but still subject to class and gendered patterns. Older people can face pension insecurity, age discrimination in work and social isolation, but also new patterns of active ageing and extended consumption. The ageing population raises structural questions for welfare provision, healthcare and intergenerational relations. Sociological explanations look at life course approaches, cohort effects and the socially constructed nature of childhood, youth and adulthood. Policies that affect age inequalities include retirement age legislation, benefits, youth services and education-to-work training. When discussing age, it is helpful to consider how age intersects with class, gender and ethnicity, for example how older women may experience different pension outcomes from older men, or how young people from disadvantaged backgrounds face steeper barriers to employment.

## Research methods and measuring social inequalities
Understanding inequality requires careful attention to how we gather and interpret evidence. Sociologists use a range of methods: official statistics and surveys can show patterns and trends across large populations; longitudinal studies reveal life-course effects; self-report and victim surveys can illuminate hidden experiences not captured by official data; interviews and ethnography provide depth and insight into meanings and lived experience. Each method has strengths and limitations in terms of validity, reliability, representativeness and ethics. For instance, official crime statistics may understate certain offences and reflect policing practices, while ethnography offers rich context but is limited in generalisability. The relationship between theory and method is central: positivist approaches favour quantitative data to find patterns, while interpretivists prioritise qualitative methods to understand meanings. Mixed methods, triangulation and methodological pluralism are valuable because they combine strengths and mitigate weaknesses. When evaluating research on inequality, always comment on sampling, access, gatekeeping, ethical concerns, and how conclusions might be shaped by the method used.

## Globalisation, the digital social world and intersectionality
Inequalities are not confined to national borders. Globalisation has altered labour markets, migration patterns and cultural exchange, producing global inequalities and new forms of social stratification. Digital communication reshapes identity, community and access to resources: social media can amplify voices and create new forms of social capital, yet digital divides leave some groups excluded. The concepts of cultural homogenisation and glocalisation capture the tension between global cultural flows and local adaptation. Intersectionality is a crucial analytical tool: it shows how class, gender, ethnicity and age intersect to produce complex experiences of advantage and disadvantage. For example, migrant women may be disadvantaged by both gendered labour markets and legal status; young men from marginalised ethnic backgrounds may experience higher policing rates combined with economic exclusion. When answering questions that involve globalisation or digital media, link theory to specific examples and show awareness of both empowering and disempowering consequences of technological and economic change.

## Exam technique
When tackling exam questions on social inequality, begin by carefully unpacking the question and allocating time based on marks. For shorter questions, define key concepts concisely and apply them to the stimulus or context. For essays, structure your response with clear paragraphs that contain a point, development, evidence and evaluation. Always integrate theory and evidence: state a theoretical perspective, show how it explains the pattern or trend, use empirical examples or research findings to support your point, then evaluate by highlighting limitations or alternative perspectives. In synoptic questions, explicitly draw links between theory, methods and substantive topics (for example, how the choice of method affects conclusions about ethnic disparities in education). Use methodological critique to strengthen evaluation—for instance, question the validity of official statistics, or note when qualitative research lacks generalisability but contributes depth. Avoid long unreferenced lists; instead, develop a sustained line of argument and conclude by weighing evidence and articulating a clear judgement. Practice timing under exam conditions, plan high-mark answers briefly before writing, and use sociological terminology accurately. Revising key studies, typical patterns and the core theoretical approaches, and practising synoptic linking of theory and methods will give you the confidence to answer questions on class, gender, ethnicity and age with clarity and critical insight.
