# Globalisation and the digital social world (Component 03) (A-level Sociology Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction and overview
Globalisation and the digital social world explores how the intensification of global connections and the rise of digital technologies change social life. This topic asks you to think about how digital communication—social media, smartphones, platforms, and the internet more broadly—operates across borders and within everyday contexts. It is concerned with shifts in culture, identity, relationships, inequality and power, and it invites you to apply different sociological perspectives to understand whether digital change produces greater freedom or new forms of control. In examination terms, this section is synoptic: you will be expected to connect theory, methods and the core themes of sociology when explaining contemporary global processes shaped by digital technology.

## Defining globalisation and digital communication
Globalisation is best understood as a set of processes that increase the interconnectedness of people, institutions and cultures across the world. It is not a single event but a collection of economic, political, cultural and technological changes that compress time and space: ideas, goods and information circulate more quickly and extensively than before. Digital forms of communication are central to this process. The phrase “digital revolution” captures the rapid expansion of digital media, while “networked global society” describes the web of relationships created by internet technologies. Media convergence refers to the coming together of formerly separate media technologies and industries, and social media and virtual communities are the everyday expressions of these changes. All of these ideas help you get to grips with the kinds of social transformations the specification expects you to discuss.

## Theoretical approaches to the digital social world
Sociological theory offers competing ways to interpret global digital change. From a Marxist perspective, digital technologies can be seen as new means of production under capitalism: platforms extract value from users’ labour and data, concentrating power in the hands of global corporations and reproducing class inequalities. Feminist approaches emphasise how digital spaces replicate and sometimes transform gendered power relations, for example through online harassment, but also through new possibilities for feminist organising. Postmodernist perspectives argue that digital media fragment identities and blur traditional boundaries between high and popular culture; they highlight the fluidity, plurality and performativity of online selves. Contemporary network theorists focus on the structural properties of digital networks and how information flows shape political mobilisation, cultural diffusion and economic structures. When answering questions, use these perspectives to explain different dimensions of the digital social world and to offer evaluative comparisons.

## Digital communication and identity
Digital environments have become major sites for identity formation and expression. Online profiles, images and posts allow individuals to craft multiple, sometimes hybrid identities that may cross national, ethnic and cultural boundaries. For many young people, social media platforms are central to self-presentation and friendship. The idea of hybrid identities captures how people mix cultural influences—local, national and global—when they construct who they are. At the same time, digital contexts produce pressures for performativity and conformity: the logic of likes, follows and algorithmic visibility encourages curated selves. Surveillance is also important; routine data collection and targeted advertising shape what is visible and profitable. This produces complex effects: digital tools can enable marginalised groups to find voice and community, yet the same spaces can expose them to abuse or commodification. You should be able to show both the empowering and constraining dimensions of digital identity.

## Digital forms of communication and social inequalities
Digital technologies do not produce equality automatically. The term digital divide captures the uneven access to devices, connectivity and digital skills across social class, age, gender and geography. People in wealthier countries or higher socioeconomic groups typically have better internet access and more sophisticated digital literacy, while many in the global South or older age cohorts remain under-connected. Inequalities are also produced within platforms: algorithms amplify some voices and marginalise others; platform labour often involves precarious work with limited rights; and targeted advertising can reproduce stereotypes and discrimination. Yet the global reach of digital platforms can also create new economic opportunities, such as remote work and micro-entrepreneurship, which may circumvent local labour markets. When analysing inequalities, consider both structural material factors—income, infrastructure and education—and cultural factors—norms, norms about gender roles or age—that shape digital inclusion and exclusion.

## Digital communication and social relationships
The digital social world transforms how people form and maintain relationships. Social media can strengthen weak ties and facilitate networks that cross traditional boundaries of place, offering new forms of social capital and collective action. At the same time, there is debate about whether online communication weakens close, face-to-face relationships, contributes to loneliness, or changes family dynamics through constant connectivity. The emergence of platform-mediated interactions—dating apps, gig economy services, online learning communities—reshapes intimacy, trust and the organisation of everyday life. The impact is not uniform: for some communities, digital connections are life-enhancing and necessary, while for others they can intensify surveillance and control. In essays, be ready to weigh evidence that digital technologies both connect and fragment social bonds, and to apply theoretical perspectives that explain these contrasting outcomes.

## Culture: homogenisation, hybridity and glocalisation
Digital globalisation raises questions about cultural change. Cultural homogenisation is the idea that global media and multinational corporations spread similar cultural products and lifestyles across the world, sometimes described as cultural imperialism. Critics counter that people adapt, resist and rework global influences, creating hybrid cultural forms. The notion of glocalisation captures this two-way process: global ideas are reinterpreted in local contexts, producing unique, mixed cultural expressions. Media convergence intensifies exposure to a wide range of cultural content, accelerating both the spread of global trends and the formation of niche communities. The digital social world therefore produces simultaneous tendencies towards global sameness and local differentiation; your answers should show how both processes operate and why one does not exclude the other.

## Global consequences: politics, crime and social change
Digitally mediated globalisation has profound political and social consequences. Digital communication enables rapid transnational mobilisation, illustrated by contemporary social movements that use hashtags, livestreaming and online organisation to coordinate protests and raise international awareness. At the same time, digital platforms can be used for misinformation, political manipulation and surveillance by state and non-state actors. Patterns of crime have changed as well: cybercrime, online fraud and transnational organised networks exploit digital infrastructure, while policing and state surveillance increasingly rely on digital tools. Education and religion are affected too, as online learning, virtual congregations and the circulation of religious ideas reshape traditional institutions. In your essays, illustrate these global consequences with contemporary examples while explaining how theoretical perspectives account for both emancipatory and repressive potentials of digital technologies.

## Researching the digital social world: methods and ethics
Studying the digital social world poses methodological challenges as well as opportunities. The availability of large-scale digital data offers new quantitative possibilities—network analysis, big data trends and algorithmic outputs—while qualitative methods such as online ethnography and virtual interviews can capture meanings and lived experience. However, issues of access, representativeness and validity are important: online populations are not identical to offline populations, platform affordances shape behaviour, and commercial datasets are often proprietary. Ethical concerns are also heightened: consent, privacy, the permanence of digital traces, and the potential harms to participants must be carefully managed. For synoptic essay work you should be able to discuss strengths and limitations of different methods in the digital context, and to evaluate how research findings relate to wider sociological theory and policy implications.

## Exam technique
Answering Component 03 successfully requires clear definitions, sustained application of theory and concrete examples. Begin longer answers by defining key terms—globalisation, media convergence, glocalisation or digital divide—and signpost the theoretical perspectives you will use. For AO1 demonstrate knowledge by explaining concepts and methods; for AO2 apply these ideas to contemporary examples such as social media campaigns, platform labour or digital surveillance; and for AO3 evaluate by weighing competing explanations, considering evidence, and noting methodological limits. In essays structure your response with an introduction that sets out your argument, development paragraphs that alternate explanation and application, and evaluative paragraphs that critically assess strengths and weaknesses before a concise conclusion. Use illustrative case material to ground abstract claims, and where relevant make synoptic links to research methods or other topic areas such as crime, education or religion to show breadth of understanding. Manage your time so you leave a few minutes at the end to refine your strongest evaluative points and ensure that each paragraph contributes to a coherent line of reasoning.
