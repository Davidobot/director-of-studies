# Research methods, ethics and sampling (Component 02) (A-level Sociology Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: why methods matter in sociology
Research methods are the toolkit sociologists use to turn questions about society into evidence. Component 02 asks you to understand the range of methods available, to explain why particular choices are made, and to evaluate their strengths and limitations, especially when researching social inequalities. Methods are not neutral: choices about what to study, how to sample, which questions to ask and how to interpret data are influenced by theoretical perspectives, practical constraints and ethical obligations. Good revision focuses not only on knowing method names, but on understanding trade‑offs—why a survey might be better for general patterns of class inequality while an ethnography can reveal how class identity is lived and felt.

## Theory and the relationship between methods and explanations
Sociological theory guides method choice. Positivists seek patterns, trends and causal relationships and therefore favour quantitative approaches that promise objectivity, standardisation and the possibility of generalisation. Interpretivists prioritise meanings, experience and verstehen; they favour qualitative methods that develop rapport and reveal how actors construct social reality. These two orientations produce different conceptions of key research concepts. Validity, in the interpretivist sense, means capturing the true meanings people attach to their actions, while in a positivist frame validity is about measuring what you intend to measure in a standardised way. Reliability refers to the consistency of findings: a reliable survey instrument yields similar results if repeated, whereas achieving reliability in open‑ended interviews is more difficult. Representativeness and generalisability concern whether findings from the sample can be applied to a wider population. When you answer exam questions, link method choices to these theoretical commitments and show awareness that no single method answers every sociological question.

## The stages of the research process
Sociological research typically follows a sequence of stages that shape outcomes. Researchers begin by choosing a research topic, influenced by personal interests, gaps in knowledge, policy relevance or theoretical debates. From a topic they formulate aims, research questions or hypotheses and then operationalise concepts so they can be measured or observed. A pilot study tests instruments and highlights practical problems. Sampling decisions determine who will be studied and how they will be accessed; access and gatekeeping can be especially important in institutions such as schools, workplaces or prisons. Data collection follows, using methods chosen to suit the question and the sample. After collection comes analysis and interpretation, and for qualitative work respondent validation can be used to check whether participants recognise the researcher’s interpretations. Finally, researchers consider implications for theory and social policy and reflect on the research process itself, including any researcher effects and ethical issues. Throughout these stages, practical constraints—time, funding, safety and access—shape what is feasible.

## Sampling: techniques and practicalities applied to inequalities
Sampling is central when researching social inequalities because patterns often differ across social class, gender, ethnicity and age. A sample needs to be selected with the research question in mind. Probability sampling approaches such as simple random, systematic or stratified sampling aim to produce representative samples that permit generalisation. Stratified sampling, for example, would be used when a researcher wishes to ensure proportions of working‑class and middle‑class participants match the target population so differences in attainment can be compared fairly. Non‑probability techniques such as quota sampling, purposive sampling, opportunity (convenience) sampling, volunteer sampling and snowball sampling are widely used when probability sampling is impractical. Snowball sampling is useful for hidden or hard‑to‑reach groups, for example when researching undocumented migrants or street gangs, but it risks over‑representing particular networks. Volunteer and opportunity samples are quick and cheap but raise questions about representativeness and selection bias. Access issues and gatekeepers are often decisive: gaining permission to research in schools or health services will shape who can be included, and negotiating with gatekeepers can itself influence the data.

## Methods: strengths, weaknesses and application to social inequality research
A wide range of methods are appropriate for Component 02 and it is crucial to match method to question. Questionnaires and structured interviews generate quantitative data that can be analysed for patterns across social class, gender or ethnicity. They are useful for large samples and comparisons across groups, but closed questions limit depth and miss lived experience. Unstructured or semi‑structured interviews and ethnography (participant observation) produce rich qualitative data ideal for exploring identity, meaning and the everyday experiences of marginalised groups; they are time‑consuming and less generalisable. Participant observation—whether overt or covert—can reveal behaviour that people would not report in interviews, but covert research raises serious ethical problems. Content analysis and documents, including official statistics, are invaluable for studying representations and long‑term trends. Official statistics are excellent for historical patterns such as employment rates or crime trends, but they reflect processes of social control and reporting practices and therefore must be interpreted critically. Mixed methods, triangulation and methodological pluralism combine the advantages of both quantitative and qualitative approaches: a survey followed by in‑depth interviews can quantify patterns and then explain them. When discussing methods in the exam, always illustrate with applied examples: a national survey measuring educational attainment across class groups, an ethnography of a youth subculture to understand deviant identities, or content analysis of media representations of ethnic minorities.

## Validity, reliability, representativeness and generalisability: trade‑offs and checks
These four concepts form the backbone of methodological evaluation. Validity concerns the truthfulness of findings; participant observation and in‑depth interviews tend to score highly for validity because they capture lived realities, while standardized questionnaires may miss nuance. Reliability is about reproducibility; structured instruments and official statistics usually score better for reliability. Representativeness and generalisability relate to the sample and whether findings can be extended beyond it; probability sampling and large samples support generalisability, while small purposive samples do not. In practice researchers balance trade‑offs: achieving high validity with qualitative work often sacrifices generalisability, while quantitative studies sacrifice depth. Researchers can improve quality by piloting instruments, using respondent validation to check interpretations, adopting clear operational definitions and combining methods to triangulate findings. In evaluation paragraphs, explain how each concept applies to the method in question and give concrete examples of how a researcher might improve or assess it.

## Ethics and researcher reflexivity
Ethical considerations guide every stage of research. Researchers should obtain informed consent, ensure confidentiality and anonymity, avoid harm and deception where possible, and allow the right to withdraw. Particular sensitivity is required with vulnerable groups such as children, prisoners, those with limited capacity, or people at risk of harm. The British Sociological Association’s ethical principles and codes provide a framework and exam questions often reward explicit references to these principles. Gatekeepers play a dual role: they can protect participants and grant access but they can also constrain research freedom. Reflexivity requires researchers to be aware of how their own identity, values and presence influence data collection and interpretation. For example, a researcher studying police culture who has a background as a serving officer may gain access and rapport but will need to reflect on possible bias and how their position affects responses. Ethical dilemmas are rarely straightforward; sound exam answers describe the dilemma, explain possible resolutions, and evaluate the implications for data quality and validity.

## Applying research methods to social inequalities: practical examples
When researching social inequalities, method choice must take account of the topic’s sensitivity, the distribution of the phenomenon and the questions you want to answer. Studying ethnic differences in educational attainment might combine analysis of national statistics to chart patterns, questionnaires to measure attitudes across a large sample, and interviews to explore pupil and teacher perceptions. Researching domestic abuse in working‑class communities would require careful ethical planning, safe access routes, and might rely on purposive sampling via support organisations; interview techniques must prioritise participant safety and confidentiality. Investigating global trends in digital divides would call on cross‑national survey data and qualitative case studies to understand how access and digital literacies vary by age, gender and class. Always explain why a method is appropriate for answering the research question, show awareness of practical and ethical constraints, and consider how theoretical perspectives inform your design.

## Exam technique
To score well in Component 02, structure answers clearly: begin by defining key terms, then explain how the method or concept works, illustrate with a concrete example relevant to social inequalities, and finish with evaluation that draws on theory, ethics and practicalities. For short questions based on sources, extract the precise methodological point the source is testing and link it to validity, reliability or sampling where applicable. For longer essays, plan to balance description (AO1), application (AO2) and evaluation (AO3). Use theory to explain why a positivist might favour a survey and an interpretivist an ethnography, and use evidence from methodological practice to evaluate those positions. When discussing sampling, always mention the implications for representativeness and generalisability and give applied examples, for instance why snowball sampling suits hidden populations but limits generalisation. For ethics, name specific issues—consent, anonymity, harm—and show how they might be resolved or how they constrain research. Time your answers so you leave space for a concluding judgement that answers the question directly, weighing up different approaches and making a clear recommendation or conclusion. Practice with past-style questions and plan paragraphs that move from definition to example to evaluation; examiners reward clarity, relevance to social inequalities and balanced critical judgement.
