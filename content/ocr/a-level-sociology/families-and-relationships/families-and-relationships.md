# Families and relationships (A-level Sociology Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Why study families and relationships?
The family remains a central focus of sociological study because it is one of the primary agencies of socialisation and one of the main contexts in which culture, identity and power are produced and reproduced. Studying families and relationships helps explain how individuals learn roles and norms, how emotional and economic support is organised, and how inequalities in wider society are reflected inside households. At A-level the topic invites students to link empirical evidence, theoretical perspectives and research methods: you will consider contemporary patterns of family life in the UK, explore why these patterns have changed, and evaluate competing sociological explanations. Understanding families also builds transferable skills — analysis, evaluation and the ability to construct sustained arguments — all of which are central to the A-level assessment objectives.

## Types of families and household diversity
Contemporary UK family life is diverse. Traditional nuclear households — a married couple and their dependent children — continue to exist alongside extended families where more than one generation share tasks or live together, lone-parent households, reconstituted or blended families formed after relationship breakdowns, same-sex couple families, and a range of non-family living arrangements including single-person and cohabiting households. The term “family” can therefore mean different arrangements in different contexts. Sociologists also talk about family diversity across class, ethnicity and sexuality: working-class families, middle-class families, immigrant family networks and culturally specific household practices can look and operate quite differently from one another. The concept of hybrid identities helps capture how cultural influences mix and change family patterns in a globalised society.

When discussing diversity, it is important to distinguish between surface descriptions of different household types and explanations for why particular forms are more or less common. The “ideology of the nuclear family” refers to the view that the nuclear family is the socially desirable, natural norm; debates about diversity often turn on whether the nuclear family remains dominant in social life, or whether postmodern fragmentation, economic pressures and changing norms have produced a genuinely plural family landscape.

## Demographic trends and causes of change
Over recent decades there have been clear demographic shifts that help explain changes in families: falling birth rates and smaller average family size, increasing age at marriage and first childbirth, rising rates of cohabitation and divorce, growth in lone-parent households, and an ageing population with longer life expectancy. These trends are not isolated: economic transformation, changing gender roles, cultural liberalisation and legal reforms all interact in producing them. Increased participation of women in paid employment and greater access to contraception have altered the perceived need for early marriage and large family size. Changes in divorce law and the destigmatisation of separation have made marital breakdown more common and socially accepted. Immigration and transnational family ties have affected household composition and the persistence of extended family support networks.

It is also useful to think about policy and structural factors. Housing affordability, availability of childcare, labour market precarity, and welfare provision all shape family formation and relationship choices. The ageing population has consequences for intergenerational relationships: more people experience caring responsibilities for both children and elderly relatives, and grandparents often play important childcare or financial support roles.

## Theoretical perspectives: consensus and conflict
Sociological theories offer contrasting views of what families do and why they take the forms they do. Functionalist accounts present the family as a stabilising institution that performs essential functions for society and for individuals: socialising children, providing emotional support and contributing to social order. From this perspective, the nuclear family is efficient for performing these tasks. The New Right shares a similar preference for traditional nuclear arrangements but frames contemporary family change as a cause of social problems, arguing that non-nuclear families undermine socialisation and responsibility.

Conflict perspectives offer different interpretations. Marxist approaches see the family as serving capitalism: it reproduces labour power, socialises children into class relations and provides unpaid domestic labour that benefits capital. Feminist theories emphasise gendered power relations within the family, arguing that the family often perpetuates patriarchy through the unequal division of paid and unpaid labour, care responsibilities and control over resources. Radical, Marxist and intersectional feminisms highlight domestic labour, emotional work and domestic abuse as mechanisms that maintain gender inequality.

Postmodernist accounts challenge grand narratives and argue that family life has fragmented into diverse, fluid forms as individuals exercise greater choice. Postmodernists emphasise consumer culture, individualisation and the decline of fixed roles. Each theoretical perspective brings strengths and limitations: consensus theories can understate conflict and inequality, while conflict theories may underplay stability and emotional bonds; postmodernism can capture diversity but sometimes struggles to explain persistent structural inequalities.

## Roles, power and the “dark side” of the family
One central sociological question is how roles and relationships inside families are changing. Debates often centre on the domestic division of labour, decision-making, paid work versus unpaid care, and who holds power in households. There is evidence of change: dual-earner families are more common, men’s involvement in housework and childcare has increased in many families, and ideas of “symmetrical” partnerships have gained currency in public discourse. Yet persistent inequalities remain. Feminist sociologists describe the “triple shift” of paid work, domestic labour and emotional labour that many women continue to carry, and time-use studies reveal that household and care tasks are still often gendered.

The family can also have a “dark side”: domestic abuse, coercive control, and child abuse are serious social issues that operate within private settings. Sociological study recognises both the supportive and the harmful aspects of family life and evaluates how power, social norms, and access to resources influence whether families are protective or exploitative environments.

## Childhood, ageing and intergenerational relationships
Sociologists also examine how changes in families affect different life stages. The idea of the child-centred family describes how many contemporary families invest heavily in children’s education, leisure and emotional well-being, often extending the period of dependence and reshaping parent–child relationships. At the other end of the life course, an ageing population creates new patterns of dependence and support: adult children often negotiate care for older parents, and grandparents may take on greater childcare roles or provide intergenerational support. These shifts raise questions about the “sandwich generation” who care for both children and elderly relatives, the economic pressures associated with care, and the role of state policy in supporting intergenerational welfare.

When discussing life course issues, it is helpful to apply intersectional thinking: class, ethnicity, gender and migration status influence how childhoods and older age are experienced and the resources available for care.

## Research evidence and methods in the study of families
Studying families requires a mix of research methods because households are private and complex. Quantitative sources such as national surveys, census data and time-use studies offer patterns and trends, for example in marriage rates, household composition and employment. Qualitative methods — in-depth interviews, ethnographies, participant observation and case studies — provide insights into meanings, relationships and power dynamics within families. Small-scale student research projects, such as interviews with local families, time-use diaries or content analysis of media portrayals of family life, can illustrate the interplay of structure and agency.

When evaluating evidence, students should be alert to issues of validity, reliability and representativeness. Official statistics may under-report phenomena such as domestic abuse or informal care, while qualitative studies provide depth but may not generalise to wider populations. Applying theoretical perspectives to empirical findings strengthens explanations: for example, using feminist theory to interpret qualitative interviews on housework, or Marxist ideas to interpret economic pressures described in survey responses.

## Teaching and classroom application
Teaching families and relationships works well when theoretical ideas are linked with contemporary examples and students’ lived experience. Use current policy developments, news stories about family law, or local demographic information to ground discussion. Encourage students to compare theoretical explanations against evidence: for instance, ask them to explain the rise in cohabitation using functionalist, feminist and postmodern perspectives, then evaluate which explanations are strongest and why. Small research tasks such as analysing media representations of family types, conducting mini-interviews about intergenerational support, or examining time-use data can develop research skills and bring abstract ideas to life. Emphasise the synoptic nature of A-level sociology by asking students to draw links between socialisation, culture, identity, research methods and family patterns.

## Exam technique
Answering exam questions on families and relationships successfully requires clear knowledge, precise application and balanced evaluation. For short questions, define key concepts and give brief examples. For application questions, always link sociological theory or evidence to the specific issue or source material in the question. For extended essays, structure your response with a clear introduction that outlines your argument, followed by paragraphs that apply different theoretical perspectives or pieces of evidence, and a conclusion that draws together judgements. Use evidence from a range of methods and consider strengths and limitations: for example, when evaluating a theory, consider its explanatory power, relevance to contemporary trends, and empirical support. Where appropriate, make explicit synoptic links to broader themes such as socialisation, identity or globalisation. Practice timing so you allocate time proportionally to the marks available, and learn to plan a brief essay structure before writing. Above all, show the examiner that you can move beyond description to analysis and evaluation, using theory and evidence to reach a reasoned judgement.
