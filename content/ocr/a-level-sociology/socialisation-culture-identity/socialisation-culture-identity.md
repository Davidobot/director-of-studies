# Socialisation, culture and identity (Component 01) (A-level Sociology Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview of the component
Component 01 introduces the core sociological themes of culture, socialisation and identity, and asks you to apply those themes within one of three option contexts: Families and relationships, Youth subcultures or Media. In the examination you will face a mixture of short and medium‑length compulsory questions based on Section A material and a Section B option with three questions that probe extended response skills. This paper is 90 marks, 1 hour 30 minutes long and contributes 30% of the A‑level. Success requires clear knowledge (AO1), the ability to apply ideas to contemporary social contexts (AO2) and reasoned analysis and evaluation (AO3), so learning the core concepts thoroughly and practising how to use them in arguments is essential.

## Culture, norms and values
Culture is the set of learned ways of thinking, behaving and communicating that members of a society share, but it is not uniform. When you revise culture think about how norms and values operate to shape behaviour, and how different types of culture exist alongside one another. High culture refers to tastes and practices long associated with elite institutions, while popular culture describes mass forms of entertainment and everyday consumption. Subcultures form when groups develop distinct styles and values that set them apart from the mainstream. Global culture and consumer culture capture the spread of cultural products and market‑driven identities across borders, while hybridity emphasises mixing and recombination of cultural forms. Cross‑cultural examples help show that what counts as “normal” or “acceptable” varies historically and internationally, and that cultural change is a constant process.

## Socialisation, agencies and social control
Socialisation is the lifelong process by which individuals learn the culture of their society and develop identities and roles. Primary socialisation in early childhood is often associated with the family, where language, basic norms and attachments are formed. Secondary socialisation continues throughout life via education, peer groups, the workplace, religion and the media; each of these agencies transmits values and expectations that shape behaviour in specific contexts. The nature/nurture debate sits behind many sociological questions about how much of identity is socially produced rather than biologically determined. Linked to socialisation is social control: formal controls such as the police, courts and legal system operate alongside informal controls like family sanctions, peer pressure and media condemnation. When you answer questions on this topic, show how agencies interact: for example, how school rules embed wider legal expectations, or how media representations influence peer group norms.

## Identity: aspects, intersection and hybridity
Identity refers to how individuals see themselves and are recognised by others. Sociological study breaks identity down into aspects such as ethnicity, nationality, gender, social class, sexuality, age and disability. These aspects do not exist in isolation: intersectional approaches emphasise how class, gender and ethnicity combine to produce different experiences and opportunities. Hybrid identities are increasingly common in a globalised world; people may draw on multiple cultural influences when constructing who they are. When discussing identity, make sure to show how agencies of socialisation shape different aspects of identity and how identities can shift over time and across contexts — for instance, the identity of a migrant who navigates national, ethnic and occupational identities simultaneously.

## Option content: Families and relationships, youth subcultures and media (how to approach each option)
If you choose Families and relationships, you should be prepared to discuss the variety of contemporary family and household forms — nuclear and extended families, lone‑parent and reconstituted households, same‑sex and non‑family living arrangements — and to account for trends in marriage, divorce, cohabitation and demographic change. Theoretical debates are central: functionalist and New Right accounts emphasise social order and the advantages of a conventional nuclear family, while Marxist and feminist perspectives highlight conflict, exploitation and gendered power. Postmodernists challenge single, fixed family norms and emphasise diversity and choice. In answers, link empirical trends to theory and consider the implications for roles and relationships, such as the domestic division of labour, the rise of the child‑centred family and the effects of an ageing population.

When you study Youth subcultures, focus on why youth cultures emerge, the social functions they serve and how theories explain them. Structural explanations from Marxist and neo‑Marxist traditions highlight class resistance and marginalisation, while interactionist accounts explain deviant subcultures through labelling and meaning‑making. Postmodern perspectives draw attention to style, consumption and hybridity in contemporary youth scenes. Be able to discuss different kinds of youth deviance, from anti‑school groups and gangs to spectacular subcultures, and the role of the media in amplifying moral panics. Use concrete examples — historical subcultures such as mods, punks and skinheads or contemporary scenes like grime and online gaming communities — to show how identity and resistance are expressed.

The Media option requires you to examine representation and effects. You should be able to identify patterns in how ethnicity, gender, class and age are portrayed and to explain these patterns using theoretical traditions such as Marxism or neo‑Marxism, pluralism, feminism and postmodernism. Media effects theories range from direct models such as the hypodermic needle to more nuanced accounts like the two‑step flow, cultural effects and uses and gratifications approaches that recognise active audiences. The media’s role in deviance amplification and the creation of moral panics is important: understand how selective reporting and sensationalism can shape public perceptions and policy responses.

## Research methods and understanding social inequalities (brief linkage)
Although this paper is focused on socialisation, culture and identity, an awareness of research methods matters because many questions ask you to evaluate evidence or use empirical material. Methods are guided by theoretical positions: positivist approaches stress objectivity and quantitative data, while interpretivist approaches prioritise verstehen, qualitative depth and the role of researcher reflexivity. Key research concepts such as validity, reliability, representativeness and generalisability are useful when you assess evidence. Familiarity with practical stages of research — choosing topics, operationalising concepts, sampling strategies, access issues and ethical constraints — helps you to critique studies cited in questions. For example, when discussing youth deviance or media representation, consider whether official statistics might under‑represent certain groups, or whether observational studies capture the full complexity of identity formation.

## Globalisation and the digital social world: connecting to identity and culture
Globalisation and digital forms of communication are cross‑cutting themes that reshape culture, socialisation and identity. Developments such as the digital revolution, social media platforms, networked societies and media convergence have changed how people form communities, present themselves and acquire cultural capital. These changes affect identity by enabling new forms of self‑presentation, by creating virtual communities and by influencing relationships across borders. The impact is uneven: digital access and skills are stratified by class, age and geography, so digital forms of socialisation can both reinforce and challenge existing inequalities. Theoretical approaches offer different readings: Marxist critiques point to commodification and corporate control of platforms, feminist perspectives highlight gendered patterns of online abuse and representation, while postmodernism emphasises fluid identities, hybridity and the erosion of clear structural anchors.

## Assessment, synopticity and what examiners expect
Component 01 will test AO1, AO2 and AO3 across both sections; you must be able to demonstrate factual knowledge, apply it to context and evaluate. Across the A‑level, AO1 carries roughly 35–45% of the weighting, AO2 about 30–40% and AO3 about 20–30%, but in practice every answer should aim to combine these elements: define terms, apply theory or evidence to the question and critique or weigh up alternative explanations. Components 02 and 03 are synoptic, explicitly asking you to draw on connections between methods, theory and the two core themes; although Component 01 is less explicitly synoptic it still rewards the ability to link cultural and identity questions to broader theoretical and methodological issues. Practise past‑style questions where you use contemporary examples and different theoretical perspectives in sustained arguments.

## Exam technique
Plan each answer to make sure it meets the command word. Start short answers with concise definitions and immediate, specific application. For extended responses allocate time to plan: write a clear introduction that frames the question and signals the argument, develop several analytical paragraphs each focused on a single point supported by theory and empirical examples, and finish with a conclusion that evaluates and reaches a judgement. Use sociological concepts and named theoretical positions throughout rather than vague assertions. When evaluating, move beyond assertion to explain limitations, weigh competing explanations, consider methodological issues with evidence cited and show awareness of change over time or variations between groups. Time management matters: in the 1 hour 30 minutes of Component 01, leave time to check that every paragraph links back to the question and that you have used evidence and theory to support your claims. Practise applying material from Section A to the option you choose so you can show synoptic thinking within the paper, and remember that examiners reward clarity, precision and well‑structured argument as much as factual knowledge.
