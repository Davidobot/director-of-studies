# Hazardous Earth (plate tectonics, volcanoes & earthquakes) (A-level Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: why Hazardous Earth matters
Hazardous Earth examines the dynamic processes beneath and upon the planet that produce earthquakes, volcanoes and associated hazards. This topic links physical systems thinking — systems, feedbacks, thresholds — with human geography: why people choose to live in risky places, how vulnerability and resilience vary between countries, and how societies attempt to manage risk. At A‑level you will be expected to explain processes at different scales, use case study evidence to illustrate impacts, and evaluate responses. The subject combines descriptive knowledge (for example, landforms, types of eruption or fault) with procedural skills: interpreting seismic graphs, using the disaster risk equation to compare vulnerability, and designing fieldwork that investigates a local hazard or the human response to it.

## Evidence and theory: continental drift to plate tectonics
The idea that continents move grew from observations of matching coastlines, similar fossil assemblages on different continents and palaeoclimatic indicators such as glacial deposits in now‑tropical latitudes. These lines of evidence led from the continental drift hypothesis to a robust plate tectonic theory when seafloor studies revealed a pattern of magnetic stripes, systematic age differences of oceanic crust, and the process of seafloor spreading at mid‑ocean ridges. The lithosphere is broken into rigid plates that move relative to one another over the weaker asthenosphere, driven by forces that include slab pull, ridge push and mantle convection. For exam answers you should be able to describe these drivers and to use the distribution of plate boundaries and the age of oceanic crust as evidence supporting the theory.

## Plate boundaries and processes
Plate boundaries are the locations where most tectonic activity occurs, and the type of boundary determines the main processes and landforms. At divergent or constructive margins, such as the mid‑Atlantic ridge and Iceland, plates move apart, magma rises and new oceanic crust is formed; volcanic activity tends to be effusive, producing basaltic lava and shield volcanoes or long fissure eruptions. Convergent or destructive margins occur where plates move together: oceanic‑continental subduction generates steep, explosive stratovolcanoes, volcanic arcs and deep ocean trenches, while oceanic‑oceanic convergence forms island arcs. Continental‑continental collision produces large mountain belts such as the Himalayas and is associated with crustal shortening and uplift rather than classic volcanic activity. Conservative margins are characterised by lateral slip, with strike‑slip faults like the San Andreas producing earthquakes but little volcanism. Understanding these contrasts is essential for explaining why volcanoes and earthquakes have different spatial patterns and hazards.

## Volcanoes: types, hazards and contrasting examples
Volcanoes vary in shape, eruption style and hazard profile. Shield volcanoes, exemplified by the Hawaiian islands, erupt low‑viscosity basaltic lava in effusive events that produce extensive lava flows but comparatively low explosivity. Stratovolcanoes, such as Mount St Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are built from alternating layers of lava and tephra and are capable of highly explosive eruptions that generate pyroclastic flows, widespread ash fall and volcanic gases. Calderas and super‑volcanoes form where massive eruptions collapse a magma chamber; the global climatic effects of very large eruptions can be significant. Hotspot volcanism, where a mantle plume produces volcanism away from plate boundaries, is responsible for chains like Hawaii and offers an important contrast to subduction‑related volcanism. Hazards from volcanic eruptions include lava flows, pyroclastic density currents, ash clouds that disrupt aviation and agriculture (as with Eyjafjallajökull 2010), lahars generated by melted snow or heavy rainfall, toxic gases, and secondary effects on climate. Case studies should show both the physical processes and the socio‑economic context, comparing, for example, the management options and impacts in a highly developed country with those in a less developed country.

## Earthquakes: causes, measurement and impacts
Earthquakes are sudden releases of elastic strain energy along faults. The location beneath the surface where rupture begins is the focus; the point on the surface directly above is the epicentre. Fault types include normal, reverse (thrust) and strike‑slip, each related to the stress regime at plate margins. Seismic waves propagate from the focus and are recorded by seismometers; magnitude scales such as moment magnitude (Mw) quantify energy release, while intensity scales such as the Modified Mercalli scale describe ground shaking and damage at particular locations. Primary hazards include violent ground shaking, surface rupture and direct collapse of structures; secondary hazards include liquefaction, landslides, fires and tsunamis when undersea rupture displaces water, as in the 2004 Indian Ocean event. Impacts vary markedly between countries: the 2010 Haiti earthquake produced catastrophic human losses and rapid social breakdown in a context of high vulnerability, whereas the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami demonstrated the immense destructive potential of a similar magnitude event but also showed how high income, preparedness and engineered protections can reduce some types of loss while not preventing all damage. Good answers integrate measurement, mechanics and human consequences and demonstrate why magnitude alone does not determine disaster outcomes.

## Risk, vulnerability, monitoring and management
Understanding tectonic hazards as disasters requires separating the physical hazard from social vulnerability and capacity. The disaster risk equation links hazard, exposure, vulnerability and coping capacity; risk can therefore fall if vulnerability is reduced or capacity increased even when the hazard remains. Mitigation strategies operate at different stages: attempts to reduce the hazard itself are rare but can include engineering defences such as lava diversion channels; strategies to reduce vulnerability include land‑use zoning to keep critical facilities away from fault lines or lahar paths, building codes and earthquake‑resistant design, public education and emergency drills. Monitoring and early warning are crucial where feasible: volcanic systems commonly show precursory signs such as increased seismicity, ground deformation and gas emissions, allowing staged evacuations, while earthquake early warning systems provide seconds to tens of seconds of lead time to shut down critical infrastructure. Tsunami warning systems, combined with coastal evacuation planning, can dramatically reduce loss of life. Insurance and economic planning form part of post‑event recovery strategies. Comparative case studies are valuable here: contrast long‑term resilience‑building measures in Japan with the social and governance challenges that amplified impacts in Haiti, and discuss how monitoring and international aid interact in differing political and economic contexts.

## Fieldwork, data and geographical skills in Hazardous Earth
Fieldwork and quantitative skills are central to A‑level geography. In hazardous earth topics fieldwork might include mapping recent volcanic deposits, measuring beach profiles to investigate post‑tsunami changes, surveying building damage patterns, or using interviews to explore community preparedness. Geo‑located data and GIS allow spatial analysis of exposure and vulnerability, helping to visualise hazard zones and to prioritise mitigation. Quantitative techniques such as calculating rates of movement, correlating damage with distance from epicentre, or applying statistical tests to survey data support robust conclusions. Qualitative approaches, including semi‑structured interviews or content analysis of media representations, help explain human responses and perceptions of risk. In the NEA you can combine primary and secondary data to investigate a focused question, such as the effectiveness of local early warning signage, or the relationship between housing quality and earthquake damage. Always show awareness of sampling, ethical issues, data reliability and representativeness when describing or evaluating fieldwork.

## Exam technique
Exam success in Hazardous Earth depends on combining precise knowledge, clear application of case study evidence and well‑structured argumentation. For AO1 demonstrate accurate definitions and descriptions of processes: explain, for example, the mechanics of subduction rather than merely naming it. For AO2 apply concepts to contexts by linking plate boundary types to likely hazards and using named case studies to illustrate impacts and responses; avoid generic assertions without specific detail. For AO3 show skills by describing methods, interpreting data or evaluating management options; where appropriate, reference fieldwork or data handling techniques. In longer answers, plan before you write: introduce the argument, present physical explanation, bring in comparative case study evidence and conclude with an evaluation or a judgement about effectiveness, linking back to the question. Use the disaster risk equation and the Park model where relevant to structure evaluations of why impacts differ. For extended responses allocate time to build a coherent line of reasoning and include both strengths and limitations of responses; a balanced conclusion that weighs mitigation against socio‑economic constraints gains marks. Practice by writing synoptic essays that connect Hazardous Earth to other themes such as climate change impacts on permafrost and volcanic hazards, or the role of global governance in disaster aid. Finally, command terms matter: "explain" requires process and causal chains, "assess" requires judgement, and "compare" needs clear contrasts; always support assertions with specific, named examples and precise geographical terminology.
