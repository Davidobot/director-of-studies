# Climate Change (impacts, mitigation & adaptation) (A-level Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What do we mean by climate change and how do we know it is happening?
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation and other aspects of the Earth’s climate system. At A-level it is important to separate natural variability — short-term fluctuations and long palaeoclimate cycles — from the recent trend of global warming driven by human activity. Multiple lines of evidence show the planet is warming: observed rises in global mean surface temperature since the late 19th century, shrinking mountain glaciers and ice sheets, reductions in Arctic sea ice and Northern Hemisphere snow cover, rising sea level and increasing ocean heat content. These observations are measured directly by thermometers, satellites, tide gauges and ocean buoys, and are supported by indirect evidence from long-term weather records and global monitoring networks. The physical changes are already affecting ecosystems, weather extremes and human systems, which is why climate change is treated as a key geographical hazard and development challenge.

## Past climates and natural drivers
Understanding past climates is essential to put recent change into context. Geologists and palaeoclimatologists reconstruct past climates using proxies such as ice cores, tree rings, marine and lake sediments, corals and fossils. These records reveal a history of greenhouse and icehouse phases, including glaciations and the warm intervals between them. Natural drivers of past climate change include variations in Earth’s orbit (Milankovitch cycles), volcanic eruptions that inject aerosols into the stratosphere, changes in solar output, long-term tectonic shifts and natural fluctuations in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. These mechanisms operated over timescales from years to millions of years. The key difference for the present day is the rate and magnitude of change: atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have risen sharply since the industrial revolution, and the extent of warming cannot be explained by natural drivers alone.

## The Anthropocene: human drivers and unequal contributions
The era in which human activity is the dominant influence on the Earth system is often called the Anthropocene. The main human drivers of contemporary climate change are the combustion of fossil fuels, industrial processes and changes in land use such as deforestation. These activities release carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — potent greenhouse gases — into the atmosphere and alter the planet’s energy balance. Emissions are unevenly distributed: advanced economies emitted large quantities of the historic carbon stock that has already warmed the planet, while emerging economies and rapidly industrialising states have driven recent increases in annual emissions. Per capita emissions and cumulative emissions tell different stories: per person, people in many advanced countries have higher footprints, whereas cumulative national emissions reflect historical responsibility. This inequality underpins much of the political debate around responsibility, equity and climate finance.

## Direct and cascading impacts on physical and human systems
Climate change affects both physical systems and human societies in multiple, interconnected ways. Sea-level rise results from thermal expansion of warming oceans and melting ice; this threatens low-lying coasts, islands and estuaries through increased flooding and erosion, illustrated by examples such as parts of Bangladesh and small island states in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns influence water availability, crop yields and food security, with drought-prone regions and dryland areas particularly vulnerable. Ocean warming and acidification damage marine ecosystems; coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef and other tropical reefs show how even modest increases in sea temperature can cause mass mortality. In polar and high-latitude regions, permafrost thaw releases greenhouse gases and destabilises infrastructure, while the retreat of glaciers affects seasonal water supplies for millions downstream. Human health is affected by vector-borne diseases, heat stress and the indirect social consequences of migration and conflict linked to resource scarcity. The geography of vulnerability matters: poorer countries and marginalised communities are often least able to adapt and therefore face disproportionate impacts.

## Feedbacks, thresholds and uncertainty
The climate system contains feedback loops that can amplify or dampen change. Positive feedbacks, such as the ice–albedo feedback where melting ice reduces surface reflectivity and accelerates warming, or the release of methane from thawing permafrost, can accelerate warming. Negative feedbacks, such as increased plant growth in some regions that sequesters carbon, act in the opposite direction but are more limited. Tipping points — thresholds beyond which change becomes self-reinforcing and potentially irreversible — are a major concern in climate science; examples under study include the collapse of parts of the Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets, dieback of the Amazon rainforest, and weakening of major ocean circulation systems. Climate models, ranging from simple energy-balance models to complex General Circulation Models (GCMs), use physical principles to project future climates under different greenhouse gas pathways. These models cannot predict every local effect, but they consistently show greater warming for higher emissions pathways. Scenario frameworks such as RCPs and SSPs help policymakers link emissions trajectories to projected impacts, while recognising uncertainties in climate sensitivity and regional responses.

## Mitigation: reducing the cause
Mitigation aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit future warming. Strategies span technological, economic and behavioural approaches. Transitioning energy systems away from coal, oil and gas towards renewables, improving energy efficiency in buildings and transport, electrifying industry and transport and deploying carbon capture and storage are core technological responses. Land-based approaches such as afforestation, reforestation and better agricultural practices can sequester carbon in biomass and soils, while dietary change and reduced food waste can lower emissions from agriculture. Market-based measures such as carbon pricing, emissions trading schemes and carbon taxes seek to internalise the cost of emissions and stimulate low-carbon investment. Mitigation also raises equity questions: the distribution of costs and benefits between countries and within societies is politically sensitive. Geoengineering ideas — deliberately altering the climate system, for example by reflecting sunlight or removing CO2 — are sometimes proposed as emergency measures, but they carry unknown risks and ethical dilemmas and are not substitutes for emissions reductions.

## Adaptation: living with the changes
Adaptation involves adjusting systems, infrastructure and behaviour to reduce vulnerability to the impacts that are already happening or are unavoidable. The adaptation framework of retreat, accommodate and protect helps to structure responses. Retreat can mean planned relocation from very high-risk zones; examples include managed realignment of floodplains in parts of the UK. Accommodation involves changes that allow people to continue living in a place, such as raising buildings, developing drought-tolerant crops or improving water management systems, as seen in rice-farming innovations in parts of Southeast Asia. Protection uses hard engineering, such as sea walls, or soft engineering, such as restoring mangroves and wetlands to reduce wave energy; Bangladesh’s embankments and coastal afforestation illustrate large-scale protection combined with community-level measures. Effective adaptation requires mainstreaming into development planning, local knowledge, and sufficient finance. There is a risk of maladaptation if actions increase long-term vulnerability or shift risk onto other groups, so careful appraisal and monitoring are essential.

## International governance and the politics of response
Global cooperation is central because climate change is a collective action problem. Scientific assessment and policy guidance are coordinated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which synthesises evidence for policymakers. International agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement provide frameworks for emissions targets, reporting and finance. The Paris Agreement’s nationally determined contributions reflect a bottom-up approach that recognises national circumstances but relies on transparency, ambition and revision cycles to increase collective effort. Climate finance — funds to help developing countries mitigate and adapt — is a central political issue, along with mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund, technology transfer and capacity building. Market mechanisms, including carbon trading and carbon credit schemes, have been used to incentivise reductions, but their design, additionality and integrity are frequently debated. Geopolitical tensions, differing development priorities, historical responsibility and the need for a just transition for workers and communities shape negotiations and implementation.

## Exam technique
When answering A-level exam questions on climate change, begin by ensuring your answer directly addresses the command word of the question. For definitions and short-answer questions, provide a concise definition and a brief example to demonstrate understanding. For explaining and analysing questions, use a clear structure: introduce the idea, explain the mechanism (how and why), and support this with specific examples or data. In extended response and evaluation questions allocate time to plan and to include an introduction, several developed paragraphs that balance explanation and evidence, an evaluation that considers alternative viewpoints or limitations, and a succinct conclusion that answers the question. Always use case studies to illustrate points — for example, refer to coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef when discussing ecosystem impacts, or to Bangladesh’s coastal management when discussing adaptation. Apply geographical concepts such as systems, feedbacks, thresholds, mitigation and adaptation to show synoptic understanding, and where appropriate refer to scenarios or model projections to support claims. Use precise geographical terminology, show awareness of spatial variation and inequality, and when critiquing policies consider feasibility, costs, equity and unintended consequences. For data-based questions, practise describing trends, making comparisons, and linking numerical evidence to real-world meaning. Finally, practise past papers under timed conditions, annotate model answers, and learn a small set of well-developed case studies so you can adapt them to a range of questions.
