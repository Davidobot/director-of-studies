# Disease Dilemmas (global health, epidemics & responses) (A-level Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview: what the topic covers and why it matters
Disease Dilemmas explores how illnesses — infectious and non‑infectious — are distributed across the globe, why patterns change, and how people and institutions try to prevent, control and, in some cases, eliminate them. The topic sits at the intersection of physical geography (climate, vectors, natural hazards), human geography (poverty, migration, governance, health systems) and contemporary debates about globalisation, inequality and sustainability. It asks you to understand classification (for example endemic, epidemic, pandemic; communicable versus non‑communicable), to identify environmental and social determinants of risk, and to evaluate the variety of responses available at individual, community, national and international scales. Real world case studies — such as malaria in sub‑Saharan Africa, cholera after natural hazards, HIV/AIDS, Ebola and recent respiratory pandemics — help to make these concepts concrete and demonstrate how complex and contested disease management can be.

## Patterns and classification of disease
Diseases are described using a small set of useful terms which help organise thinking and data. Endemic diseases are those that persist at a predictable level in a place, while epidemics are outbreaks above expected levels and pandemics are epidemics that spread across many countries or continents. Communicable (infectious) diseases are transmitted by pathogens and often require vectors, reservoirs or direct contact; non‑communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease arise from a mix of genetic, behavioural and environmental causes. Mapping the global distribution of malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, stroke and type 2 diabetes reveals clear contrasts: many LIDCs and EDCs carry the heaviest burden of infectious disease linked to poverty, inadequate sanitation and weak health systems, while ACs face the highest proportions of NCDs associated with ageing populations, sedentary lifestyles and dietary changes. Disease diffusion models, including Hägerstrand’s ideas about spatial diffusion, help explain how new infections expand from points of origin through travel corridors, social networks and environmental suitability.

## Environmental drivers and vectors
Physical geography shapes where many diseases can establish. Temperature, rainfall, standing water and relief influence vector populations; mosquitoes that transmit malaria and dengue thrive in warm, humid conditions with accessible breeding sites, which is why these diseases are common in tropical and subtropical zones. Seasonal cycles — monsoon rains or dry seasons — alter transmission intensity and can create predictable peaks in incidence. Climate change is shifting these patterns: warming and altered rainfall expand the geographic range and season length of some vectors, enabling pathogens such as West Nile virus or certain ticks to appear in new places. Natural hazards, too, can trigger outbreaks when infrastructure is damaged and sanitation fails; cholera outbreaks after earthquakes or floods are classic examples where standing contaminated water and disrupted services create rapid increases in gastrointestinal disease. The concept of zoonoses — diseases that spill over from animals to humans, such as avian influenzas or coronaviruses — highlights connections between land use, wildlife, livestock and human health, and is central to the One Health approach.

## Economic development, the epidemiological transition and inequality
Levels of development strongly influence both the types of disease that dominate and society’s capacity to respond. The epidemiological transition describes a shift from a prevalence of infectious, poverty‑related diseases to chronic, non‑communicable diseases as a country develops. Improvements in sanitation, vaccination and maternal health reduce mortality from communicable diseases, while changes in diet, work and lifespan increase NCDs. Yet these changes are rarely uniform within countries. Urban slums can experience high rates of infectious disease alongside rising NCDs among wealthier urban residents — a double burden linked to inequalities in income, housing, education and access to health care. Remittances, migrant flows and trade can improve economic resilience but also alter disease exposure and access to treatments. Social determinants such as gender, ethnicity and age further shape vulnerability: for example, women’s access to reproductive health services affects maternal mortality, and poverty constrains both prevention and treatment options.

## Predicting, preventing and responding to outbreaks
Predicting disease involves surveillance, data collection and modelling. National health systems and international bodies rely on routine reporting, laboratory confirmation and, increasingly, genomic sequencing to detect emerging threats. Models combine information on host susceptibility, vector ecology, mobility and social behaviour to forecast likely spread and to test the effects of interventions. Prevention strategies vary by disease and context: vector control (insecticide‑treated nets, indoor residual spraying), improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), vaccination programmes, screening and isolation are standard tools. During outbreaks, prompt case finding, contact tracing and community engagement can break chains of transmission. The COVID‑19 pandemic re‑emphasised the value and limits of non‑pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and travel restrictions; these work best as part of a layered response alongside testing, treatment and vaccination. Physical barriers such as mountains and remoteness can slow spread but may also hinder delivery of aid and medicines, requiring carefully planned logistics and local partnerships.

## International governance, NGOs and pharmaceutical issues
Global organisations and non‑governmental actors play essential roles in disease management. The World Health Organization provides guidance, coordinates surveillance and can mobilise technical assistance, while NGOs such as Médecins Sans Frontières often lead frontline responses in weak health systems. Transnational pharmaceutical companies drive research, vaccine and drug production, but issues of patents, pricing and distribution create inequalities in access to treatments. The history of HIV treatment demonstrates the tensions: breakthroughs in antiretroviral therapy transformed prognosis, yet access in many low‑income settings lagged until price reductions, generic manufacture and international funding increased availability. Pharmaceutical transnationals also influence which diseases receive investment through intellectual property regimes and market incentives, while grassroots and community‑led education and prevention programmes can be highly effective where trust in authorities is low. Conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants — for example species that have yielded important drugs — highlights another layer: biological resources and traditional knowledge can be vital for pharmacology, but international trade and overharvesting pose conservation and equity challenges.

## Eradication, control and realistic limits
Eradication — the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of an infection — is rare but possible, as smallpox demonstrates. Polio has been the subject of decades‑long global eradication efforts and is close, though setbacks such as vaccine‑derived cases and political obstacles remain. Many diseases are controllable but not erasable: reservoirs in animal populations, asymptomatic carriers, complex vector ecologies and weak surveillance mean that full eradication is often unrealistic. For some emerging pathogens, eradication is impossible and the focus shifts to control, mitigation and adaptation. Long‑term strategies combine strengthened health systems, sustained financing, surveillance infrastructure and community resilience, and they must be tailored to local social and environmental contexts. The role of traditional medicines and local health knowledge can be complementary to biomedical approaches, especially when integrated respectfully into public health practice.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Disease Dilemmas, start by defining key terms early (for example endemic, epidemic, pandemic, communicable, non‑communicable) to show clear command of vocabulary (AO1). Use named, contemporary case studies to anchor explanations — choose one communicable and one non‑communicable example and make sure at least one case study is beyond the UK where required; explain the context, causes and consequences rather than merely describing events. For short answers, be precise and link physical or human factors directly to disease patterns. For medium and extended responses, structure your answer with an introduction that frames the question, a clear sequence of paragraphs each developing a single idea with evidence (data, maps, examples) and a conclusion that evaluates or judges the extent of your argument (AO2). Where synoptic marks are available, explicitly draw links across the specification: connect climate or landscape processes to vector ranges, or governance and globalisation to access to medicines. Use quantitative or methodological detail when relevant — for example mention surveillance, sampling, rates of incidence, or mass balance of vector habitats — to earn AO3 credit. When discussing management or eradication, consider scale (local, national, international), actors (governments, NGOs, TNCs), and the limitations imposed by inequality, logistics or ecology; assess both successes and unintended consequences. Finally, practise writing timed essays with exam‑style prompts and annotate exemplar answers to identify where the best responses use precise geography language, balanced evaluation, and well‑selected case evidence.
