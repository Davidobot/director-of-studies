# Landscape Systems (coasts, glaciers, drylands) (A-level Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Introduction to landscape systems
Landscape systems are a way of thinking about the Earth surface as a set of connected components: stores, flows, inputs and outputs of energy and material. This systems approach helps you to move beyond memorising landforms and instead to understand causes, interactions and change through time. Whether you study a coastline battered by Atlantic waves, a valley shaped by past and present glaciers, or a desert where wind and episodic rivers alternate as the dominant agents of change, the same conceptual tools apply. Key ideas you will use repeatedly include the balance between inputs and outputs (for example, sediment supply versus removal), feedbacks and thresholds (for instance, when a small increase in wave energy triggers cliff collapse), and scale (from the grain size of beach sediment to sediment cells hundreds of kilometres long). Thinking in systems terms also makes it easier to link physical processes to human impacts and management responses, a central requirement in the OCR A-level specification.

## Energy, material flows and sediment budgets
A central feature of landscape systems is the movement of energy and material. Energy comes mainly from the sun and gravity and drives processes such as evaporation, precipitation, wind generation and water flow. Material moves as sediment, ice, water and organic carbon. For coasts you will repeatedly use the sediment budget concept, where beaches gain and lose sand through sources such as eroding cliffs, rivers and offshore deposits and lose sediment through longshore drift and offshore transport. In glaciated systems the equivalent is mass balance: the difference between accumulation (snowfall and avalanching) and ablation (melting, sublimation, calving). For drylands the aridity index and episodic inputs from pluvial phases or flash floods control the availability of water and therefore sediment mobility. In all landscapes human activities can alter these balances: river damming reduces sediment supply to coasts; greenhouse gas emissions change mass balance through warming; groundwater abstraction alters vegetation cover and increases erosion in drylands. Practically, understanding and calculating sediment budgets and mass balances is an essential topic-specific skill because it ties processes to measurable change and helps you evaluate management options.

## Coastal landscapes: processes, landforms and change
Coastal systems are dynamic interfaces between land and sea controlled by waves, tides, currents, geology and human action. Waves perform three principal roles: erosion, transportation and deposition. Constructive waves build beaches by depositing sediment; destructive waves erode cliffs and remove beach material. Longshore drift moves sediment along the shore and, together with variations in coastal geometry and river sediment input, produces characteristic depositional landforms such as spits, tombolos and barrier beaches. Rocky coasts develop cliffs, shore platforms, caves, arches and stacks where lithology and structure concentrate erosion, whereas low-energy coasts such as estuaries favour mudflats and salt marshes. Sea level change produces emergent and submergent coastlines: falling sea level exposes raised beaches and marine terraces, while rising sea level drowns valleys to form rias and fjords. Human interventions — sea walls, groynes, beach nourishment and managed retreat — illustrate intentional change, but economic development such as port construction, harbour dredging and tourism can unintentionally disrupt sediment cells and accelerate erosion elsewhere. Case studies often used at A-level include the rapidly eroding Holderness coast for erosion and managed realignment examples, the dynamic spit at Hurst Castle or Selsey Bill, and the Thames or Severn estuaries to illustrate depositional, low-energy environments. For exam answers, link process explanations to landform development, use sediment budget reasoning, and assess how management alters flows and long-term landscape trajectories.

## Glaciated landscapes: glacier mechanics, landforms and periglacial environments
Glaciated landscapes reflect both the erosive power of moving ice and the depositional imprint left when ice retreats. Glaciers form where winter snowfall exceeds summer melt over many years, transforming snow into dense glacial ice. Valley glaciers and continental ice sheets behave differently: valley glaciers carve U-shaped valleys, cirques (corries), arêtes and pyramidal peaks through processes such as plucking and abrasion; ice sheets produce broad erosional scours and deposit tills, drumlins and erratics. Glacier movement occurs by internal deformation and, where conditions allow, by basal sliding; the thermal regime of a glacier (cold- or warm-based) strongly influences its erosive potential. In post-glacial landscapes meltwater forms glacio-fluvial deposits such as eskers, kames and outwash plains, while periglacial processes around ice margins or in cold non-glaciated regions produce patterned ground and pingos. Contemporary human impacts include tourism infrastructure on upland glaciers, hydropower schemes that trap sediment and alter downstream channels, and resource extraction that can change melt patterns. Climate change is central here: warming has reduced glacier mass worldwide, changing mass balance and leading to lake formation, slope instability and altered river regimes. Effective case studies contrast a UK valley glacier legacy (for example, the Lake District or Scottish Highlands) with larger-scale examples like the Scandinavian fjords or the Patagonian icefields to show differences of scale and process.

## Dryland landscapes: aeolian and fluvial processes, dunes and water scarcity
Dryland landscapes vary from polar drylands to hot, low-latitude deserts and semi-arid steppes, but they share aridity as a defining control. The aridity index provides a quantitative measure used to classify drylands. Wind is the dominant agent of change in many deserts: it erodes by deflation, transports material by saltation and suspension, and abrades rock surfaces to form ventifacts and yardangs. Aeolian deposition creates dune forms whose shape depends on wind regime and sediment supply: barchan dunes indicate unidirectional winds with limited sediment, linear and star dunes form under more complex wind flows. Fluvial processes operate episodically in drylands — wadis and ephemeral rivers carry powerful flash-flood flows that construct alluvial fans and bajadas. Dryland landforms often owe their existence to past climates: pluvial phases deposited river terraces and pediments, while periglacial episodes left frost-shattered slopes and solifluction deposits. Human pressures in drylands centre on water supply and economic activity: extraction and damming alter sediment delivery and wadi dynamics, and tourism or off-road vehicle use damages fragile crusts leading to increased erosion. Case studies might contrast the Sahara and the American Southwest or examine pastoral land-use change in the Sahel to explore the interaction of physical vulnerability and human response.

## Fieldwork, skills and quantitative techniques
Practical geographic skills are integral to studying landscape systems. Fieldwork in coastal, glacial or dryland settings can involve observation, measurement and geo-spatial mapping to collect primary data that tests hypotheses about process and form. Common coastal field methods include beach profile measurement, sediment sampling and grain-size analysis, longshore drift tracing using painted pebbles, and sediment budget calculations. Glaciated landscape fieldwork often focuses on mapping landform distribution, measuring moraine orientation, and undertaking mass balance estimates using stake networks or remote-sensed data. Dryland research uses transects across dune systems, sediment trap sampling and analysis of ephemeral channel morphology. Digital skills are now essential: GPS and GIS enable geo-located data collection and spatial analysis, while basic statistical skills — mean, median, range, and tests of association such as Spearman’s rank — help you quantify patterns and assess significance. When planning an investigation you must consider sampling design, sampling frequency and ethical issues; the OCR specification requires evidence of fieldwork across physical and human geography and expects students to be able to justify methods, present data clearly, analyse results using appropriate techniques and evaluate confidence and limitations of findings.

## Exam technique
Success in exams comes from combining clear knowledge of processes and landforms with specific, well-chosen case study evidence and a systems-based explanation of change. Start answers by directly addressing command words: describe questions require organised, factual accounts; explain questions require causes and links between processes and outcomes; assess or evaluate questions demand balanced argument, judgement and evidence. Always situate processes within a system: identify inputs, stores, transfers and outputs, and where relevant apply the concepts of feedbacks and thresholds. Use case studies to illustrate points — name places, give dates or magnitudes where possible, and explain how human action modified the natural system. When tackling longer questions, structure your response with a concise introduction, clear development paragraphs that focus on separate aspects (process, landform, human impact, management), and a conclusion that returns to the question with a judgement. Diagrams are powerful: a labelled cross-section of a cliff profile, a simplified sediment cell sketch, a mass-balance graph or a map of dune types can convey complex ideas quickly; ensure every diagram is linked to the text. Include skills and fieldwork where appropriate by mentioning data types, sampling strategies and limitations. Time management is critical: allocate longer to higher-tariff questions, plan extended responses briefly before writing, and leave time to check terminology and the clarity of your argument. Regular practice with past questions, applying the systems language and practicing sediment budget or mass balance calculations under timed conditions, will build confidence and precision for the examination.
