# Investigative Geography & Fieldwork Skills (NEA preparation) (A-level Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## What the Independent Investigation is and why it matters
The Investigative Geography component of OCR A Level Geography (H481) is your opportunity to carry out an extended, self-directed piece of geographical enquiry into a question that genuinely interests you. Unlike the timed written papers, this non-exam assessment (NEA) is a sustained investigation that asks you to plan, collect and analyse data, and then present a reasoned conclusion in continuous prose. The exercise is designed not just to test factual knowledge but to develop and demonstrate the core geographical abilities that universities and employers value: designing an enquiry, using both primary and secondary evidence, applying quantitative and qualitative techniques, and thinking critically about uncertainty, ethics and representativeness. The investigation should be rooted in the specification content so that it can draw links to physical topics such as coastal processes or water and carbon cycles, or human topics such as place-making, migration, trade or governance, making it an excellent way to bring together learning from across the course.

## Structure, length and the mark scheme
The NEA is marked out of sixty and is divided into six distinct strands that together reward the whole investigative process. The first strand assesses planning, purpose and introduction; the second looks at data, collection methods and your sampling framework; the third assesses the ways you present data; the fourth examines your analysis and explanation; the fifth requires clear conclusions and a critical evaluation; and the sixth assesses the overall quality and communication of the written report. The recommended length for the final written report is between three and four thousand words; there is no automatic penalty for exceeding this range but longer reports must still be concise, coherent and directly relevant to the enquiry in order to score highly. When preparing your investigation you should aim to meet the highest descriptors in each strand: a precise geo-located context and well-justified aims for planning; clearly justified, ethical and appropriate methodologies for data collection; selective and well-balanced presentation of the most influential evidence; rigorous and appropriate analysis (including statistical or qualitative techniques where suitable); conclusions that are tightly linked to the aims and that draw on evidence and theory; and careful, well-referenced prose integrating figures and sources.

## Choosing and shaping your question: independence and guidance
Selecting a suitable question is one of the most important steps. The specification requires that your investigation is defined and developed by you individually, so the title and sub-questions must originate from your own thinking. Teachers may set broad parameters, such as available fieldwork locations, equipment or time limitations, and can explain what independence means and offer general advice about health and safety or referencing. What teachers may not do is provide a list of ready-made titles for you to pick from, or give specific feedback on drafts that would amount to individualized coaching to meet the assessment criteria. Your initial exploratory discussions with your teacher and peers can be productive for refining ideas, but the final title, the justification for your investigation and the contextual research must be your own work. It is good practice to choose a question that sits comfortably within the specification content and that allows you to collect primary data alongside relevant secondary sources; examples might be testing changes in beach sediment size along a stretch of coastline, comparing spatial patterns of deprivation and service access in two neighbourhoods, or investigating the impact of land-use change on infiltration rates in a drainage basin.

## Fieldwork design, sampling and data collection
Fieldwork is central to the NEA and to A Level Geography more broadly: centres must ensure learners undertake at least four days of fieldwork across the course, including work on both physical and human processes. When designing fieldwork, you need to think about the data type required to answer your question and choose methods that provide robust, replicable evidence. Primary data collection can be collaborative and carried out in groups, which is often necessary to gather sufficient sample sizes in a limited time, but you must record clearly what you personally did and be ready to analyse your own data independently. Secondary data must be identified and selected independently. Sampling design matters: your choices about location, frequency, range and sample size should be justified in the light of the question and the practical constraints, and you should anticipate likely sources of error. Using geo-located data and geospatial tools strengthens an investigation: GPS-tagged samples, maps created in a GIS, and spatial layers such as land-use or elevation can give you precise locational evidence and support spatial analysis. Ethical and socio-political dimensions should not be an afterthought; explain how you obtained consent for interviews or surveys, how you protected anonymity, and how your methods avoided harm or bias where appropriate.

## Data presentation and analysis: quantitative and qualitative approaches
Presenting the most influential data selectively is essential to clarity and to scoring well. Effective presentations integrate maps, annotated photographs, graphs and tables in a way that highlights the patterns relevant to your hypothesis. A balance of simple visualisations and more sophisticated techniques is preferable: clear scatterplots, boxplots or cumulative frequency graphs for quantitative evidence sit well alongside thematic maps produced in GIS and carefully coded qualitative extracts from interviews. Analytical techniques must be appropriate to the data and the question. For quantitative datasets, descriptive statistics (mean, median, range, interquartile range and standard deviation) are often useful, and where comparisons or relationships are being tested, apply tests of association or significance such as Chi-squared, Spearman’s rank, Mann–Whitney U or t-tests when their assumptions are met; explain your choice and the limitations. For qualitative material, demonstrate systematic approaches such as coding, thematic analysis or content analysis and explain how these help you interpret meanings and perceptions. Always link analysis back to the aims or hypotheses and use relevant geographical theory or models to frame explanations, for example using sediment budgets to explain coastal change or concepts of place and identity to interpret survey responses.

## Conclusions, evaluation and quality of communication
Your conclusions should directly answer your enquiry, using primary and secondary evidence and, when appropriate, drawing on wider theory to build an argued case. A high-quality conclusion acknowledges degrees of certainty, links back to the stated aims or hypotheses and synthesises the investigation’s principal findings. The evaluation is equally important: reflect on data reliability, sampling limitations, measurement accuracy, the representativeness of the dataset and any ethical constraints, and suggest realistic improvements or further lines of enquiry. Consider how the fieldwork experience extended your geographical understanding and connect implications to broader debates in the specification. Presentation and communication are judged as a discrete strand: structure your report with clear sections, integrate figures and text so that maps, graphs and tables are cited and explained within the narrative, use technical geographical vocabulary accurately and provide full referencing and a bibliography. Where teaching assistance or other third-party input exceeded general guidance it must be recorded on the authentication form and annotated in the script; failing to record such assistance risks allegations of malpractice.

## Practical administration, moderation and retakes
There are administrative procedures that centres and learners should be aware of. The centre must complete the Geography Independent Investigation Form for each learner and both teacher and learner must sign the authentication declaration confirming the work’s provenance. Moderation is managed by OCR and samples of work will be requested; centres submit samples either by electronic moderated upload or by post, and the method must be chosen at entry. If a learner retakes the A Level they may either resubmit a new NEA or carry forward their most recent NEA mark; the decision to carry forward must be made at the point of entry and the carried-forward NEA mark can be used for the lifetime of the specification. Centres must also provide a written fieldwork statement confirming at least four days of fieldwork across the A Level, including physical and human investigations; this statement is part of centre responsibilities and must be submitted in the year of entry. Keep careful, dated records, photographic evidence of fieldwork and secure storage of drafts and raw data: these practices both support good research and protect learners and teachers if administrative questions arise.

## Exam technique
Although the NEA is a coursework task, examination technique matters because the skills you practise in the NEA are assessed in the written papers and because effective communication boosts marks in the NEA itself. When answering longer exam questions, open with a brief, focused line that directly addresses the question, then use evidence and theory to build two or three developed points, each with explanation and specific exemplification. For data-response questions, be explicit about the data used and refer to figures or maps by number; when you draw on fieldwork, summarise methods concisely and link findings to wider processes. For the NEA, make sure each section of your report maps to the mark scheme: in your introduction clearly state aims and geo-location, in your methodology explain and justify sampling and ethical choices, in presentation choose only the most relevant figures and integrate them into the text, in analysis apply appropriate statistical or qualitative techniques and explain their meaning, and in your evaluation be balanced, critical and forward-looking. Time management in the examination series is also crucial: practise writing synoptic answers that bring in concepts from different topics, and plan the structure of extended responses before writing so arguments are logical and sustained. Finally, proofread; small errors of labelling, referencing or ambiguous figures can cost marks even when the underlying geography is strong. Across coursework and exams, clarity, rigour and a clear link between evidence and argument are the hallmarks of top-level performance.
