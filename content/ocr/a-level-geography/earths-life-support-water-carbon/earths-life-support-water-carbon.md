# Earth’s Life Support Systems (water & carbon cycles) (A-level Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Why these cycles matter: an introduction
Water and carbon are the twin life-support systems of the planet. Water shapes landscapes and governs weather and climate; carbon is the chemical backbone of living organisms and a key control on the Earth’s energy balance. Together they circulate between the land, oceans and atmosphere through linked pathways that operate over timescales from seconds to millions of years. Understanding these cycles as systems — with stores, fluxes, residence times and feedbacks — is central to A‑level physical geography. It helps explain why changes in land use, fossil fuel consumption or climate can ripple through environments and societies, creating impacts that range from local water shortages to shifts in global climate. In this unit you will be expected to describe the processes and stores, compare how the cycles operate in contrasting places, and evaluate the human pressures and management responses.

## The cycles as systems: stores, fluxes and timescales
Treating the water and carbon cycles as systems gives you a framework for organising knowledge. Each cycle has major stores or reservoirs: for water these include the atmosphere, surface water, groundwater and the cryosphere; for carbon the key stores are the atmosphere, terrestrial biomass, soils, oceans and geological deposits. Fluxes are the flows between stores — evaporative fluxes, river runoff, photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, weathering and sedimentation. Residence time is important: water in the atmosphere moves quickly (days), whereas deep ocean waters and geological carbon stores can lock material away for centuries to millions of years. A mass balance perspective is useful: inputs must roughly equal outputs over a chosen timescale unless a store is changing. Small changes in fluxes can produce large consequences when feedbacks operate. Positive feedbacks amplify change, for example melting permafrost releasing carbon that increases warming; negative feedbacks work to restore balance, such as increased plant growth removing more CO2 as atmospheric levels rise (until other limits appear). When you answer synoptic questions, explicitly link stores, fluxes and feedbacks and consider the timescale and spatial scale of the processes you describe.

## The water cycle: key processes and human influence
At its simplest, the water cycle moves water between ocean, atmosphere, land and cryosphere through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, interception, infiltration, percolation, throughflow, groundwater flow and runoff. Evaporation converts liquid water to vapour from open water and soils; transpiration is the plant-mediated loss from leaves; evapotranspiration combines both and is a central term when assessing continental water budgets. Interception by vegetation delays or reduces direct input to soils; infiltration rate and soil permeability control whether water enters subsurface stores or becomes overland flow. In catchment hydrology, the storm hydrograph summarises the response of a basin to rainfall: flashy hydrographs with high peak discharge follow urbanised, steep or impermeable catchments, while rural, vegetated basins with high infiltration produce more attenuated responses and sustained baseflow.

Human activity alters all parts of the cycle. Urbanisation increases impermeable surface area and peak runoff, exacerbating flood risk. Deforestation reduces interception and increases runoff and soil erosion; irrigation transfers water from rivers, reservoirs or aquifers into the agricultural system and can cause groundwater depletion and salinisation. Groundwater extraction from confined or unconfined aquifers may produce aquifer drawdown, reduced baseflow to rivers and land subsidence. Water management techniques therefore include demand-side measures (efficiency, pricing, reuse) and supply-side options (reservoirs, managed aquifer recharge). In A‑level answers, use the language of flows and stores and quantify where possible: simple mass balance calculations (inflows minus outflows) and rates of flow help turn description into analysis, and field-derived data such as hydrographs or infiltration rates make arguments stronger.

## The carbon cycle: processes, sinks and human perturbation
The carbon cycle links biological activity, geochemical reactions and human economies. Photosynthesis transfers carbon from the atmosphere into plant biomass; respiration by plants, animals and microbes returns it to the atmosphere. Decomposition recycles carbon into soils or releases CO2 and methane; weathering and sedimentation move carbon into oceanic and lithospheric stores. Oceans absorb CO2 at the surface; some of that carbon is sequestered by biological processes and by the slow formation of carbonates and sediments. Fossil fuels and sedimentary rocks represent very large, long-term carbon stores formed over millions of years.

Since the Industrial Revolution humans have substantially altered the carbon budget by combusting fossil fuels, changing land cover and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. These anthropogenic fluxes have raised atmospheric CO2 concentration and altered the planetary energy balance, contributing to global warming. The capacity of oceans and terrestrial ecosystems to act as sinks is not fixed: warming reduces solubility of CO2 in seawater and can stress forests, while thawing permafrost can turn soil stores into sources. Carbon management strategies are diverse: mitigation focuses on reducing emissions and enhancing sinks through afforestation, improved agricultural practices and carbon capture and storage; adaptation accepts some level of change and plans to reduce vulnerability. When evaluating strategies, consider their permanence, scalability, ecological side-effects and socio-economic feasibility.

## Contrasting case studies: tropical rainforest and Arctic tundra
Contrasting examples reveal how the same cycles operate differently across environments. In a tropical rainforest, such as the Amazon, water cycles rapidly through interception, high rates of evapotranspiration and intense recycling of moisture; forests return large quantities of water vapour to the atmosphere, feeding regional precipitation regimes. Carbon is held largely in above‑ground biomass and in nutrient-rich but shallow soils; rapid decomposition means forests are dynamic carbon pathways. Deforestation therefore reduces evapotranspiration, modifies local and regional rainfall, releases large carbon stores, and alters sediment and nutrient flows. Management responses include protected areas, reforestation and sustainable land‑use practices, but they interact with economic pressures and governance.

The Arctic tundra offers a very different picture. Much of its carbon is locked in cold soils and permafrost, with long residence times. Seasonal thaw and freeze cycles dominate the water cycle: shallow active layers become saturated in summer with extensive surface water and wetlands, and winter snow and ice store water for long periods. Human activities such as oil and gas development, infrastructure and warming-driven permafrost thaw change both cycles: thaw can release ancient carbon as CO2 and methane, create thermokarst landscapes and alter hydrology by draining or creating ponds. Management here faces logistical constraints, complex feedbacks and geopolitical considerations. Comparing these two environments in answers helps to show an ability to apply knowledge to contrasting contexts, which examiners reward.

## Human impacts, feedbacks and global management responses
Human-induced disturbances are pervasive: land-use change, extraction of groundwater and fossil fuels, irrigation and pollution alter fluxes and stores in both cycles. These actions create feedbacks that can accelerate change, producing thresholds and potential tipping points. For example, large-scale deforestation can reduce regional rainfall enough to change forest to savanna, a quasi‑irreversible transition in some models. Likewise, loss of Arctic sea ice reduces albedo, amplifying warming and increasing the rate of ice loss. Management at local, national and global scales aims to reduce risks and restore function. Integrated drainage basin planning and sustainable groundwater management help balance human water needs with environmental flow requirements. For carbon, policies range from national emissions reduction targets and carbon pricing mechanisms to ecosystem-based approaches such as wetland restoration and international agreements that aim to coordinate action.

Practical management must consider equity and uncertainty. Richer countries have historically contributed more to cumulative emissions but poorer nations frequently suffer greater vulnerability. Any evaluation of mitigation or adaptation must therefore weigh technical effectiveness against social justice and economic capacity. Furthermore, monitoring and research are essential: long-term datasets, remote sensing, flux towers and field studies provide the evidence base to detect change, test models and guide policy. As a student, be ready to discuss the relative merits and limitations of interventions and to link local examples to global frameworks such as international agreements or market mechanisms.

## Exam technique
Success in exams comes from combining accurate knowledge with clear argument and appropriate use of case studies and data. When answering AO1 style questions, be precise about definitions, stores and processes and use correct technical vocabulary (for example, interception, throughflow, basal sliding, sequestration). For AO2, apply concepts to places and explain cause-and-effect chains; move beyond description to show why and with what consequences a process occurs. Use specific case study detail to support your points: name a landscape or ecosystem, describe observed changes and link them directly to the cycle you are discussing. For AO3, bring in quantitative reasoning: simple mass-balance statements, rates of flow, a labelled sketch hydrograph or a short calculation can differentiate answers. When asked to evaluate, weigh evidence, consider alternative explanations, discuss uncertainties and mention timescales — short-term processes often require different responses to long-term changes.

Structure is important. Start with a brief focussed introduction that answers the question, then present clear paragraphs that link evidence and explanation, and finish with a concise, balanced conclusion that addresses the command word (assess, evaluate, explain). Use diagrams sparingly but effectively: a well-labelled sketch can save words and clarify relationships. Always integrate case study material rather than leaving it as a separate paragraph; examiners look for synthesis. Time your paper so you leave minutes to check and refine your higher‑tariff responses. Practice past-paper questions under timed conditions and get feedback on the deployment of case studies and the use of data. Finally, remember fieldwork and investigative skills: if you can refer to techniques such as sampling design, rates of flow measurement or the use of geospatial data when relevant, you show an applied understanding that boosts AO3 marks.
