# Global Connections (trade, migration & governance) (A-level Geography Oxford Cambridge and RSA)

## Overview
Global Connections brings together the big processes that knit the world together: flows of goods, capital and people, and the institutions and rules that try to regulate them. In OCR’s A-level this topic requires you to study global systems — choosing either international trade or global migration — and global governance, choosing either human rights or issues of power and borders. The theme is deliberately synoptic: it asks you to move between scales, to see how global patterns shape local lives and how local actors feed back into global systems. Key concepts you should carry through your revision are interdependence, inequality, representation and governance. These ideas help you explain why the same processes create winners in some places and losers in others, why states sometimes cooperate and sometimes clash, and why ordinary people experience globalisation in very different ways.

## Global systems — Trade in the contemporary world
When you study trade you need to be comfortable with three components of international exchange: merchandise, services and capital. Merchandise remains visible in containerised exports, but services and financial flows have become hugely important in recent decades. Spatial patterns of trade show both inter-regional links, such as Asia–Europe freight corridors, and intensive intra-regional trade, for example inside the European Union. These patterns closely reflect uneven socio-economic development: core economies tend to control high-value services and advanced manufactured goods, while many peripheral states remain reliant on commodity exports.

Trade has grown more complex because of technology and the internationalisation of production. Multinational corporations fragment production into global supply chains so a single product may cross borders many times in the course of manufacture. Regional trading blocs and preferential agreements alter market access, while the growth of south–south trade has shifted some historical patterns. The rise of services and digital trade further complicates measurement and regulation. At the same time trade creates interdependence: an export boom can lift incomes and fund healthcare and education, yet it can also expose a country to price volatility, environmental degradation and political leverage from powerful trading partners. When you use case studies, focus on illustrating these tensions — for example an Emerging and Developing Country (EDC) that has grown through export-led manufacturing, the role of MNC investment and how trade has both stimulated growth and produced new vulnerabilities.

## Global systems — Global migration
Migration is not a single phenomenon but a set of dynamic flows of people driven by economic opportunity, conflict, environmental change and social networks. Contemporary patterns include traditional South–North corridors, such as labour flows from parts of Asia and Latin America to high-income states, but also strong South–South corridors, for example within Africa and between South Asia and the Gulf. Migrant remittances are a critical part of this story; money sent home can be a stabilising economic force for many households and national economies but is accompanied by social costs such as family separation and, in some cases, brain drain.

Migration has become more complex because of demographic change, rising female participation in migration, shifting labour markets and changing national immigration policies. Conflicts and persecution have increased refugee numbers, while highly skilled migration and circular migration patterns add new dimensions. When analysing migration, attend to both the opportunities — labour supply, remittances, skill transfer — and the challenges, such as integration pressures, unequal rights, and political contestation over borders. Case studies should show interdependence: how migrants, sending and receiving states, and global markets connect; how policies in one country shape flows elsewhere; and how migrants themselves are agents who transform places.

## Global governance — Human rights
Human rights sit at the intersection of norm-setting, law and geopolitics. Patterns of human rights practice vary globally; some states uphold broad civil and political rights while others restrict freedoms, and many forms of rights violations — forced labour, high maternal mortality, use of capital punishment — have distinct spatial distributions linked to development, governance and cultural context. Global governance of human rights involves treaties, institutions and informal norms. The United Nations, international courts and a proliferation of NGOs and transnational networks all claim roles in promoting and protecting rights.

Intervention in human rights issues raises difficult questions of sovereignty, legitimacy and effectiveness. International responses can bring immediate relief and longer-term legal or institutional change, yet they can also be contested and imperfect. A useful revision approach is to compare how different instruments — diplomatic pressure, sanctions, humanitarian assistance, international criminal prosecutions and partnership with local civil society — operate in practice and to evaluate their outcomes for people on the ground. When you choose a case study of women’s rights or another human rights issue, emphasise change over time, the multiple actors involved and the consequences (both intended and unintended) for local communities.

## Global governance — Power and borders
Sovereignty and territorial integrity have been foundational to the modern international system, but they are subject to ongoing pressures. Economic globalisation and the influence of transnational corporations can erode aspects of state control, while supranational institutions, such as regional trading blocs, demand pooled sovereignty in return for market access. Ethno-political movements, contested boundaries and competition for resources also strain territorial integrity.

Global governance plays an important role in regulating conflict over territory. Treaties, peacekeeping missions, international courts and diplomatic frameworks provide mechanisms for dispute resolution, but their effectiveness varies. The practical consequences for citizens can range from humanitarian relief and restored order to protracted legal limbo and economic isolation. In essays you should be ready to explain the multiple causes of sovereignty challenges, show how governance mechanisms respond, and evaluate their success by looking at impacts on stability, trade and daily life.

## Interconnections, inequality and scale
A striking feature of Global Connections is how tightly interconnected its sub-themes are. Trade affects migration and vice versa; governance choices influence trade routes and migrant rights; global economic patterns shape local inequality. These interconnections operate at different scales, so a robust answer will move from broad patterns to local examples and back again. Use indicators such as export value, remittance inflows, Human Development Index scores, and statistics on maternal mortality or forced labour to ground your arguments, but also draw on qualitative sources to reveal lived experience and perception. Remember that interdependence means uneven vulnerability: a shipping choke-point or the collapse of a factory in one country can have ripple effects across suppliers, workers and consumers elsewhere. Good case studies are recent, clearly located, and explicitly linked to this chain of cause and effect.

## Research, data and fieldwork skills for Global Connections
To succeed in this topic you need both conceptual understanding and confident use of geographical methods. Quantitative skills are important when handling trade and migration statistics: be able to interpret graphs, calculate rates, understand data caveats and, where appropriate, apply simple tests of association. Qualitative approaches are equally valuable for governance topics: analysing policy documents, NGO reports and media representations helps you to assess norms, power relations and legitimacy. Geospatial technologies such as GIS are powerful for mapping flows and visualising spatial patterns; primary fieldwork can be used to explore local impacts of global processes, for example through interviews with migrants or surveys of local businesses affected by trade. Ethical considerations must be integral to your methods, especially when working with vulnerable groups. For the non-exam investigation, choose a focused question that is feasible within available resources, and ensure your methodology, sampling and presentation link tightly to your enquiry.

## Exam technique
In exam answers aim to combine precise factual knowledge with clear analysis and evaluation. Start by defining key terms and setting the scale of your discussion. For short-answer questions be concise and accurate; for medium and extended responses structure your writing into a clear argument that uses case study evidence to support analysis. Always link back to the question stem and make explicit synoptic connections where relevant — for example, show how trade patterns underpin migration or how governance mechanisms affect both trade and human rights. Use the assessment objectives as a guide: AO1 requires accurate knowledge and description, AO2 expects application and explanation in context, and AO3 rewards the deployment of geographical skills and evidence.

When using case studies, pick two contrasting examples (for instance an Advanced Country and a Low-Income Developing Country) and be ready to draw comparisons. Balance description with evaluation: after explaining a process or policy, assess its implications, limitations and alternatives. In longer essays plan time to build an introduction that outlines your argument, several paragraphs each tackling a strand of the question with specific evidence, and a conclusion that directly answers the question and considers wider significance or future trajectories. For the Investigative Geography NEA, be rigorous about methodology, justify your choices, show independent analysis and reflect critically on reliability and ethics. Above all, practise applying theory to contemporary, 21st-century case studies, and make sure your answers show how global systems and governance produce complex, scale-dependent outcomes for people and places.
