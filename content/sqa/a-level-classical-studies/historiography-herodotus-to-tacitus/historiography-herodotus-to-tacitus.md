# Historiography: Herodotus to Tacitus (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Herodotus and the birth of historical curiosity
Herodotus is often called the 'Father of History' because he moves beyond mere chronicle to ask why events occurred. In Books 1 and 7 of his Histories he combines travelogue, ethnography and narrative of the Persian Wars in a way that foregrounds inquiry. Herodotus collects stories, reports rival versions of the same episode and often leaves the reader to weigh different accounts. His method values the abundance of testimony: oral reports, local traditions and eyewitness recollection all appear as ingredients in his reconstruction. This approach produces digressions that can seem episodic, but these digressions are part of a deliberate technique. They illuminate the diversity of the Greek and non‑Greek world, supply contexts for the main events, and show that history cannot be reduced to a single perspective. Herodotus accepts myth and legend as conveyors of memory; he is willing to narrate them but usually signals uncertainty by reporting them as what “they say” or by presenting alternative explanations. The result is a historiography that is eclectic, moralising at times, and fascinated by human behaviour and chance. For students, Herodotus teaches that sources often conflict and that assembling them is itself a historical act.

## Thucydides and the pursuit of causal explanation
Thucydides presents a contrasting model. In the books prescribed for study he is analytical, tightly structured and concerned with causation. Thucydides treats the Peloponnesian War as a subject for scientific inquiry: he privileges direct observation, contemporary documents and his own critical judgement. The narrative is chronological and concentrated, and he believes that understanding human nature explains political outcomes. Thucydides’ speeches — the Periclean Funeral Oration and others — are not transcripts but constructed set speeches that articulate motives, strategic thinking and moral debate. These speeches function as interpretative tools; they reveal how leaders would have argued and thus help explain decisions and consequences. Thucydides is particularly interested in the dynamics of power, fear and interest as causes of conflict, and he is alert to the dangers of moral judgement that ignores systemic factors. For learners, Thucydides models rigorous source discrimination and the importance of seeking underlying causes rather than accepting surface appearances.

## Polybius: practical method and comparative analysis
Polybius writes with an explicitly reflective methodology and a practical political purpose. Book 3 exemplifies his attention to sources: he consults official records, previous historians, eyewitness testimony and even his own observations. As a participant in events and as someone acquainted with Roman institutions, Polybius argues for a mixed approach that balances narrative with analysis. He is concerned with how constitutions, institutions and military practices produce political success or failure, and he frequently compares Greek and Roman forms of government to explain Rome’s rise. Polybius is more sceptical than Herodotus about myth and more methodical than Thucydides in his use of documentary evidence; he sets criteria for reliability and highlights discrepancies when evidence cannot be reconciled. For teaching, Polybius is a useful bridge between descriptive narrative and systematic political history, showing that historians can combine empirical collection with theoretical explanation.

## Livy: Rome’s myths, moral purpose and rhetorical structure
Livy’s Praefatio and Book 1 demonstrate a Roman approach to history that blends moral instruction with patriotic narrative. Livy is explicitly concerned with exempla: his account of the early Roman kings, the rape of Lucretia and the founding myths involving Romulus and Numa are shaped to teach civic virtues and warn against moral decay. He draws on earlier annalists and oral tradition, and he sometimes acknowledges the legendary character of his material while insisting on its instructive value. Livy’s arrangement is chronological and sweeping; he uses set speeches to present characters’ motives and to dramatise ethical dilemmas. These speeches are rhetorical devices that allow Livy to evaluate actions and promote Roman values such as pietas, gravitas and disciplina. His art lies in weaving myth and history into a continuous narrative that explains Rome’s identity. For students, Livy prompts questions about the purpose of history: when is the historian an educator and when an analyst? It also encourages careful reading of how narrative selection can reflect didactic aims.

## Tacitus: suspicion, subtlety and the politics of interpretation
Tacitus in the Annals adopts a markedly different tone. Books 1 and 14 illustrate a historiography that is intimate with imperial power and sceptical about official accounts. Tacitus, who had experience of the imperial administration, reads documents and oral testimony through a lens of moral and political concern. He is particularly attentive to personality, motive and corruption, and he often attributes sinister intentions to emperors and their advisers. Where Polybius looks for institutional causes and Thucydides for structural dynamics, Tacitus emphasises the role of character, secrecy and the manipulation of truth. His style is concise and ironic, and he uses speeches and anecdotes as vehicles of interpretation rather than literal reports. Tacitus also demonstrates how historical bias can be productive: his suspicious reading of sources alerts readers to propaganda, suppressed information and the rhetorical uses of history. Studying Tacitus helps students appreciate the historian as critic and the ways in which narrative choice can expose or conceal power.

## Major themes across the authors: evidence, speeches, myth and purpose
Across Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Livy and Tacitus students should note recurring historiographical themes. Attitudes to evidence vary: Herodotus welcomes diverse testimonies and values cultural context; Thucydides insists on eyewitness and documentary grounding; Polybius sets out explicit criteria for reliability; Livy preserves tradition for moral instruction even when it is not verifiable; and Tacitus interrogates official sources with scepticism. The use of set speeches is another common device. None of the historians presents speeches as verbatim transcripts; instead these speeches construct motive, dramatise conflict and provide interpretative lenses. Understanding their rhetorical purpose is essential when evaluating testimony. The relationship between myth and history is complex. Early Roman history in Livy relies on legend to supply exempla, and Herodotus interweaves local myths with historical narrative, whereas Polybius and Thucydides tend to prune mythology when it obstructs causal explanation. Finally, the uses of history shift from instruction and entertainment to analysis and political argument: Herodotus often delights and instructs, Livy moralises to shape Roman identity, Thucydides seeks explanation for future leaders, Polybius offers lessons in statecraft, and Tacitus warns about the perils of autocracy. Bias and causation are central: every historian selects material and implicitly or explicitly prioritises causes. For example, Thucydides attributes the Peloponnesian conflict to fear and imperial rivalry, Livy to moral failure, and Tacitus to personal corruption and systemic secrecy. Recognising these interpretative frames is crucial for any comparative exercise.

## Exam technique
When approaching SQA-style questions on history and historiography, begin with an explicit plan that identifies the task: whether you must analyse, evaluate, compare or discuss. For source analysis, show close reading by referencing specific passages or episodes from the prescribed books and explain what they reveal about the author’s method, tone and purpose. Always consider provenance: who wrote the passage, when, for what audience, and with what agenda? For evaluative questions, move beyond summary to weigh strengths and weaknesses: assess the author’s access to evidence, their method of selection and any evident bias. Use set speeches as examples of rhetorical strategy rather than literal reporting, and be ready to show how speeches help the historian explain motives. In comparative questions, structure your answer around clear criteria such as attitude to evidence, treatment of myth, causal explanation, use of speeches and intended function of history. Compare authors directly by contrasting example with example rather than offering isolated mini-essays. For essay questions in Part B, adopt a coherent line of argument with a clear introduction that frames the debate, body paragraphs that develop distinct points supported by textual evidence and historiographical comment, and a conclusion that answers the question succinctly.

Time management is crucial in the three‑hour paper. Allocate time for planning and leave a short window for revision. For the project–dissertation, choose a focused, arguable issue and plan a clear methodology. Use a range of primary and secondary sources, be critical about evidence, and reference consistently. Keep a research log, justify the inclusion or exclusion of evidence and ensure the final argument synthesises differing perspectives into a reasoned judgement. Whether writing an exam response or a dissertation, always foreground the question, select targeted evidence, comment on authorial purpose and acknowledge limitations in the sources. These habits will help you move from description to analysis and will demonstrate the high‑order skills that Advanced Higher Classical Studies seeks to reward.
