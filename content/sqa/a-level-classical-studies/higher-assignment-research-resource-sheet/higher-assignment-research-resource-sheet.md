# Higher assignment: research and resource sheet technique (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What the Higher assignment is for and how it fits the course
The Higher Classical Studies assignment is designed to let you demonstrate the subject skills you have developed across the course: choosing an issue, researching and evaluating evidence, analysing and synthesising information, comparing classical and modern worlds, and reaching a reasoned conclusion. The task has two distinct stages. In the research stage you build your knowledge and gather and evaluate material. This stage is normally undertaken over about eight hours of guided independent work. The production of evidence stage is a timed, supervised assessment of one hour and thirty minutes in which you write a report using only the single-sided A4 Classical Studies resource sheet you have prepared. The assignment is externally marked and is worth 30 marks, representing 27% of the overall course assessment, so success here depends on disciplined planning, targeted research and careful preparation of the resource sheet.

## Choosing and framing your question
Selecting the right issue or question is the first and most important decision. The best questions are focused, contestable and allow comparison between the classical and modern worlds. Rather than a broad prompt such as “Slavery in Athens”, aim for something sharper like “To what extent did the use of enslaved people limit Athenian democracy in the fifth century BC?” or “How far does Sophocles’ Oedipus the King present fate as unavoidable?” A clear question makes research efficient and gives you a readable structure for the final report: introduction and context, arguments supported by evidence, evaluation of counter-arguments, a comparison with the modern world, and a concise conclusion. Teachers may suggest general topic areas, but they should not provide the exact question or specific resources for you to use.

## Conducting focused research and evaluating sources
Treat the research stage as methodical evidence collection and critical evaluation. Combine primary evidence from classical texts and inscriptions with reputable secondary interpretations and archaeological reports. For a political topic you might use passages from Thucydides, Aristotle or inscriptional evidence; for religion use hymns, ritual descriptions and material remains such as temples and votive offerings; for literature use the text you have studied for the classical literature paper and critical commentaries. Always ask what each source can actually tell you, what it cannot tell you, and how reliable it is given its date, purpose and perspective. For example, a dramatic text such as Antigone reveals values and debates staged for a festival audience, but it is not straightforward factual history. Archaeological finds can illuminate everyday life but often require careful contextualising. Take clear, referenced notes during research, record full bibliographic details, and mark which extracts or quotations you may wish to place on your resource sheet. Good research balances breadth (different kinds of evidence) with depth (close reading of key passages).

## Crafting the Classical Studies resource sheet
The resource sheet is the only permitted aid during the supervised production of evidence, and it must be a single side of A4 with no more than 250 words. Because of this severe limit, every word must be chosen for its value. Use the sheet to capture the essentials you will need under timed conditions: a tightly worded thesis statement that answers your question, one or two brief context sentences, three to five pithy evidence points each linked to a source, and the key comparative observation with the modern world. Prefer short, labelled fragments rather than full sentences: for instance, “Enslavement: Athens — Aristotle Just. Slavery; domestic, public; skilled work, manumission evidence (inscriptions).” If you use abbreviations, make sure you (and only you) understand them. Include short citations so you can signal sources in your report, for example “Thuc. 6.2 (Sicily debate)” or “Soph. Oed. 440–470 (oracle scene)”. Do not attempt to cram long quotations onto the sheet — it is better to paraphrase the idea and note where the quotation can be found. Remember that the resource sheet is submitted with your assignment and will be checked; failing to submit it attracts a fixed penalty of six marks from the total 30.

## Structure and strategy for the production of evidence stage
The production stage is tightly supervised: you must be in direct sight of the invigilator, not allowed to communicate with others, and your only permitted material is your resource sheet. You have one hour and thirty minutes, so plan your time before you begin. A practical approach is to spend the first ten to fifteen minutes reading your resource sheet and drafting a quick plan, allocate about sixty minutes to write the main report, and keep the final ten to fifteen minutes for review and proofreading. Structure the report with a short introduction that restates the question and your answer, a contextual paragraph setting out essential background, two or three development paragraphs that each introduce an argument supported by evidence and evaluation of reliability, a paragraph that directly compares your findings with a relevant modern example, and a concise conclusion that evaluates the balance of evidence. Use signposting language so the marker can follow your logic: make clear where you evaluate a source’s usefulness, and where you are synthesising contradictory evidence. Avoid introducing new facts or sources that are not on the resource sheet; your argument should build from the material you gathered in the research stage and distilled onto the sheet.

## Academic integrity, supervision and reasonable assistance
Throughout the process you must produce your own work. During research, supervision is “some” rather than full control: teachers may monitor progress, hold interim meetings and advise on accessibility of resources, but they must not provide the question, direct you to specific sources to be used, or supply model answers or structures tailored to your assignment. In the production stage the centre exercises a high level of control. Group work is allowed during research only if you can show clearly what your individual contribution was. Keep drafts, reading logs and a record of progress so you can demonstrate authenticity if required. Use of unauthorized materials during the production stage or submitting work that is not your own will be treated as malpractice and can invalidate your assignment.

## What examiners are looking for and how marks are allocated
Examiners are assessing a set of interrelated skills: selecting and justifying an appropriate issue, effective research and selection of evidence, critical analysis and evaluation of sources, synthesis into a coherent argument, comparison between classical and modern contexts, and a well-reasoned conclusion taking counter-arguments into account. High-scoring responses demonstrate depth of knowledge, precise use of relevant evidence, balanced evaluation of source reliability, and a clear final judgement that follows from the arguments presented. Common weaknesses include unfocused questions, over-reliance on a narrow range of sources, descriptive writing that lacks evaluation, failure to make the required comparison with the modern world, and a resource sheet that is either too vague to help in the production stage or so cluttered that key points are hard to find. Remember that the resource sheet is not marked directly but is essential to your performance; it should therefore be a working tool, not an academic essay in miniature.

## Preparing practically and refining technique before the assessment
Treat the assignment as you would a timed exam in terms of rehearsal. Practice producing a 1,200–1,500 word report in one hour and thirty minutes using only a single-sided 250-word prompt that you prepare beforehand. Simulate supervision conditions where possible: generate a resource sheet, place it face up on the desk, and write the report without consulting notes beyond that sheet. Use these mock runs to refine what you put on the resource sheet and to improve your time allocation. During revision, build a compact personal glossary of key terms, memorable short summaries of core primary passages and their relevance, and a small bank of modern comparisons you can deploy (for example, modern debates about citizenship and migration when comparing Athenian democracy, or modern public health responses when comparing ancient healing cults). Keep a log of feedback from teachers on your practice reports and use it to target weak areas such as source evaluation or comparative analysis.

## Exam technique
When you sit the timed production of evidence stage, begin by reading the brief carefully and then spend focused minutes translating your resource sheet into a skeletal plan. Open with a one-sentence thesis that answers the set question and signals the line of argument you will follow. Use paragraphs to separate distinct claims and make sure each paragraph contains both evidence and evaluation — extract the exact line from your resource sheet that supports the point and immediately note any limitations of that evidence. Explicitly address counter-arguments and weave in the required classical/modern comparison in a dedicated paragraph so the examiner can clearly see you have met that assessment requirement. Keep an eye on time and reserve the final ten minutes to check the structure, add brief clarifications where necessary and correct any careless errors. Write in clear, academic prose rather than conversational language, but avoid over-long sentences that become hard to follow. If you find you are running out of time, prioritise a clear conclusion that states which side of the argument you find more persuasive and why, using two sharp supporting points. Finally, submit your resource sheet with your report; remember the fixed penalty for non-submission. Practising these habits under timed conditions will make your performance in the supervised production stage much more confident and effective.
