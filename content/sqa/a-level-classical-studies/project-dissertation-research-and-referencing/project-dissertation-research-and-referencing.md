# Project–dissertation research and referencing (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Course structure and assessment overview
Advanced Higher Classical Studies is assessed through two complementary components: a three-hour question paper worth 100 marks and a project–dissertation worth 50 marks, together making 150 marks for the course. The three-hour paper tests close reading, analysis, evaluation and comparative judgement across one chosen section of the syllabus, while the project–dissertation is an extended piece of independent research that demonstrates planning, sustained argument, synthesis of evidence and judgement. The dissertation should be between 3,000 and 4,000 words, excluding references and appendices, and candidates must submit a word count. Work that exceeds the maximum by more than ten percent attracts a penalty, so planning to meet the upper limit is important. The overall course grade is awarded on the combined marks from the paper and the dissertation.

## Aims, skills and what examiners expect
The course aims to deepen understanding of the classical world and its continuing relevance by developing high-level skills of analysis, evaluation and synthesis. Examiners look for evidence that you can justify a research question, plan and carry out a programme of research, analyse and evaluate primary and secondary material, and present a coherent, sustained line of argument which reaches a reasoned conclusion. In the question paper, marks reward accurate analysis of classical sources, critical evaluation of their value and limitations, and well-structured comparative discussion between classical and modern perspectives. For the dissertation, markers expect a clear research focus that is investigable, engagement with a range of appropriate sources, critical reflection on those sources, appropriate methodology, and careful, accurate referencing. Demonstrating an ability to interrogate differing viewpoints and to show why you accept or reject particular interpretations is central to achieving the higher grades.

## Choosing a dissertation topic and planning your research
A successful dissertation begins with a well-chosen issue: one that invites analysis, judgement and comparison, rather than simple description. Frame your question so that it can be answered by assembling and weighing evidence, for example by asking “How justified is the view that X?” or “To what extent did Y influence Z?”. Early discussions with your teacher should clarify scope and feasibility and check that sufficient primary and secondary material is available. Good planning reduces later pressure. Agree a realistic timetable that includes checkpoints for topic selection, an initial bibliography, a first draft and final submission. Aim to develop no more than three or four central sub-issues to structure your work; this helps you to go into appropriate depth rather than skimming a wide range of topics superficially. Be prepared to amend the plan if new evidence or readings change your perspective, but always record any changes and the reasons for them as part of your working log.

## Research methods, sources and critical reading
Advanced research draws on both primary and secondary sources. Primary sources include the prescribed literary texts and, where relevant, inscriptions, coins, archaeological reports and images. Secondary sources include academic monographs, journal articles and scholarly chapters that offer interpretation or methodology. When using online material, choose reputable academic sites, university pages or digitised editions of primary texts and always note the URL and date of access. Approach every source with the same critical questions: who produced it and when, what was the purpose, what evidence is offered, does the author show bias or limitations, and how does this work compare to other scholarship? Good practice in note-taking will save time: record the author, full bibliographic detail, page numbers for quotations or specific points, and short summaries of the source’s argument. Summarise rather than over-quote; concise paraphrase shows you have understood an argument and reduces the risk of accidental plagiarism. Keep a working bibliography and a research log to record decisions, source evaluation and the development of your line of argument.

## Referencing, presentation and use of evidence
Accurate and consistent referencing is essential. Use an agreed academic convention and apply it consistently throughout your dissertation. Footnotes should give full publication details the first time a work is cited and may be shortened on subsequent references. Footnotes are for citation and appropriate supplementary comments only; avoid turning them into an extension of the main argument. Your bibliography should be organised clearly, separating primary sources, secondary academic works, online resources and any images or maps. When including images, number figures consecutively, give a concise caption indicating title, creator and date where known, and supply the source and page number or URL and access date. Quotations should be limited to short, well-chosen passages that support your point; long quotations are rarely necessary and can interrupt the flow of your argument. When you paraphrase an author’s ideas, still provide a reference: acknowledging the source of an idea is not optional. This careful attention to referencing not only avoids plagiarism but also shows the marker the breadth and quality of your reading.

## Managing supervision, authenticity and reasonable assistance
The project–dissertation is intended to be the candidate’s own work carried out with minimum support. Teachers should offer reasonable assistance at key stages by advising on the suitability of a topic, suggesting accessible sources, providing feedback on plans and drafts, and agreeing milestone dates. Reasonable assistance does not include composing text for the candidate or substantially reworking drafts; any help given must be recorded so that assessors can judge the candidate’s independent contribution. During the research phase, group work and peer discussion are appropriate, but the finished dissertation must be entirely individual. Centres are expected to put in place mechanisms to assure authenticity, for example through regular progress reviews, checkpoints, spot interviews or short oral presentations that confirm a candidate’s knowledge of their own work. Keep copies of planning notes, meeting records, and drafts, as these help to demonstrate the research process and support authentication.

## Practical tips for writing, structure and time management
Write in a clear, academic tone and avoid conversational phrases. The dissertation should begin with a brief introduction that states the research question, explains its importance and outlines the structure. Each main section should address one of the sub-issues identified in the plan and end with a short synthesis that links it back to the central argument. Use subheadings sparingly to guide the reader through complex material, and ensure transitions make the logic of your argument clear. A well-argued conclusion does not simply summarise but evaluates the weight of evidence, addresses any unresolved problems and shows how your findings answer the research question. Manage your time so that you leave a final period for careful proofreading, checking citations, formatting figures and ensuring your word count is within the permitted range. Hand in with the required documentation, including your word count. Treat presentation as part of your academic credibility: consistent formatting, legible type and neat pagination make it easier for markers to read and mark your work fairly.

## Exam technique
Approach the three-hour question paper with a clear plan. You will answer only one section of the paper, which is divided into Part A (classical literature) and Part B (classical society). Part A typically contains source-based questions that require close analysis, evaluation and comparison of classical texts, and one question that asks you to compare a classical text with a modern source. Part B offers longer essay questions that demand analysis, evaluation and synthesis into a sustained line of argument. Read every question carefully and note command words such as “Analyse,” “Evaluate,” “Compare” and “Discuss” as these determine the approach required. Allocate time in proportion to the marks: leave sufficient time to plan, write and briefly review each essay. For source questions, begin by identifying the precise point you will make about the source’s language, technique or argument; support this with short quotations and explain their significance. In comparative questions use the sources as evidence rather than as mere background: balance discussion by considering similarities and differences and evaluate the limitations of each source. In longer essays structure your answer with a clear introduction that sets out your interpretation, a series of focused paragraphs each addressing a specific point or sub-issue and ending with a conclusion that weighs the evidence and reaches a judgement. Where a modern source appears, use it to illuminate or challenge classical perspectives, but always ground your discussion in the classical material. Lastly, practise past paper questions under timed conditions and seek feedback using the specimen marking instructions so you understand how marks are awarded and how to make the best use of evidence and time in the examination.
