# Individual and community: Plato, Aristotle, Cicero (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: the problem of the individual and the polis
The tension between individual interests and communal organisation is a central concern in ancient political thought. In the Greek and Roman texts set for this topic — Plato’s Republic (Books 1–5), Aristotle’s Politics, and Cicero’s De Officiis — different answers are offered to similar questions: why do political communities exist, what is the proper place of the individual within them, what obligations bind citizens, and how should power be organised so that both order and the good life are possible? Reading these works together shows a shift from ideal theorising to empirical enquiry and finally to practical prescription rooted in Roman republican experience. Understanding each author’s aims and social context helps you see why they prioritise different relationships between self and community and how their conclusions are designed to address the problems of their own times.

## Plato: the just city and the education of citizens
Plato’s Republic opens as a debate about justice. By Books 1–5 Socrates has led his interlocutors through the famous construction of an ideal or “just” city to show how justice at the level of the polis corresponds to justice within the soul. Plato’s method is distinctive: rather than beginning with laws and institutions, he constructs a city by imagining what would happen if people specialised according to natural aptitudes. From this model emerges a tripartite society of producers, auxiliaries (soldiers), and rulers. Correspondingly the soul is divided into appetite, spirit, and reason; justice occurs when each part performs its function under the governance of reason. Book 3 develops a systematic programme of education and censorship designed to produce citizens suited to their roles, while Book 4 sets out the psychological analogy and defines the virtues appropriate to each class. In Book 5 Plato makes some of his most controversial proposals for his own era: the radical suggestion that women with equal natural ability should receive the same education as men and share in guardianship, and the idea of communal living for the guardian class — including shared property and children — as a way to remove private interests that might undermine public duty. The “noble lie” or myth of metals is introduced as a civic myth to secure social cohesion. Throughout these early books Plato treats the polis as an ethical instrument: organisation is justified insofar as it shapes character and secures the common good. When you study these books, focus on how Plato links educational programmes and cultural regulation to his moral account of the person and how individual flourishing is defined by the health of the city.

## Aristotle: polis as natural association and the priority of the good life
Aristotle’s Politics offers a different approach. Where Plato builds an ideal from abstract definitions, Aristotle surveys constitutions, households and empirical examples to reach conclusions about political life. For Aristotle the polis is a “natural” community that arises from the deeper natural associations of household and village, and it exists so that humans — who he famously calls a “political animal” — may achieve the good life. A recurring theme is teleology: institutions are good to the extent that they fulfil their purpose. Aristotle is therefore concerned both with justice as distribution and with the correct ordering of goods and responsibilities. He analyses forms of government and distinguishes between correct and deviant versions (monarchy versus tyranny, aristocracy versus oligarchy, polity versus democracy); his preference often lies with mixed or constitutional regimes that can combine stability and the common interest. Aristotle criticises Plato’s proposals for communal property and households among guardians because they appear to undermine natural family bonds and practical incentives; he worries that abolishing private property and family will damage the emotional foundations of society. His account of citizenship is narrower than modern democratic definitions: the citizen is one who takes part in deliberation and judgement, and not all residents (slaves, women in Aristotle’s view, and many foreigners) fit that role. When revising, pay attention to Aristotle’s method: careful examination of existing constitutions, attention to function and ends, and a recurrent pragmatic concern for moderation and the preservation of the polis as the necessary context for moral development.

## Cicero: duties, natural law and civic virtue in the Roman world
Cicero’s De Officiis responds to the practical moral anxieties of a Roman elite in a turbulent late Republic. The treatise is an extended reflection on what is honorable (honestum) and useful (utile), and on how a man in public life should balance personal and civic obligations. Cicero draws heavily on Stoic ideas of natural law and universal reason while remaining rooted in Roman concepts of duty to family, clients, and the res publica. For Cicero the moral agent must harmonise private benefits with public good: the honorable tends to be useful in the best sense because a stable polity depends on citizens who put the common interest above narrow advantage. His use of historical exempla — praising Cato and other republican figures while criticising opportunists — is designed to instruct Roman magistrates, not to construct a theoretical utopia. Cicero’s emphasis is on practical judgment, the duties of office, and the ethical requirements of friendship and fidelity. In the classroom, bear in mind that Cicero writes as an active politician and lawyer; his prescriptions aim to guide behaviour under existing institutions rather than to redesign the constitution.

## Power, weakness and justice: how each author conceives inequality
All three authors confront the problem of unequal power, but they treat it differently. Plato’s solution is regulatory: eliminate the temptations to faction by binding guardians to a higher educational discipline and communal arrangements that erase private advantage. For Plato the stability of rule requires moral elites who have internalised the good and who therefore rule without personal interest. Aristotle accepts inequality as a fact to be managed: distinctions between classes, household heads and slaves are real and must be ordered so the whole can flourish. He develops a complex notion of justice that includes both distribution according to merit and corrective measures for wrongdoing. Cicero is more concerned with the ethical restraint of power: magistrates must be guided by a sense of duty, and the best defence against domination is a culture of civic virtue and norms that shame corrupt behaviour. When comparing the texts, note how Plato’s idealising moves are possible because he assumes a philosophically ruled elite; Aristotle’s conservatism rests on careful classification and practical checks; Cicero’s approach is rhetorical and normative, designed to cultivate restraint in those who hold office.

## Moral obligations: individual duties to self, family and state
Each text offers a model of moral obligation that affects how the individual relates to the community. In Plato the obligation of the individual is to perform the role fitted to the soul: justice is internal harmony expressed in social order, so personal fulfilment comes from conforming to one’s natural function within the city. Education is the primary instrument for shaping these obligations. Aristotle situates duties within a larger account of virtue: moral excellence is achieved in social practice and the polis provides the context for habit formation. Duties to family, friends, and fellow citizens are integral to living well, but Aristotle is skeptical of abstract, universal duties that ignore concrete relationships and function. Cicero, interpreting and adapting Stoic thought for a Roman audience, proposes duties that are universal yet practical; duties to parents, country and friends are expressed through actions that respect natural law and the conventions of Roman honour. In your essays, be ready to compare these conceptions: Plato emphasises structural and pedagogical solutions; Aristotle emphasises teleological roles and habituation of virtue; Cicero emphasises moral reasoning and exempla that instruct conduct under existing institutions.

## Necessity and limits of social organisation: censorship, education and law
All three thinkers see social organisation as necessary, but they draw different boundaries around what should be regulated. Plato famously envisages tight control over education, poetry and myth to cultivate citizens of the right character; censorship is justified as a means to an ethical end. Aristotle is wary of such extensive state interference; while he endorses legislation aimed at moral education, he prefers laws that are proportionate and sensitive to local customs, arguing that too much uniformity or overreach can destabilise the polis. Cicero, working within the Roman legal and moral tradition, emphasises the role of law, custom and rhetoric in shaping civic life: law should reflect natural justice and the practical wisdom of experienced statesmen, while moral example and oratory cultivate the public virtues. When teaching this topic, use concrete textual examples: Plato’s proposals about education and communal arrangements for guardians, Aristotle’s critique of communal property, and Cicero’s practical admonitions to magistrates. Linking these to modern debates about the role of schooling, censorship, welfare and law helps students appreciate the enduring relevance of the questions.

## Comparative perspectives and modern relevance
Reading the three authors together sharpens comparative skills. Plato’s project is normative and radical, an attempt to show how justice might be realised if political arrangements were structured according to philosophical insight. Aristotle is more pluralist and empirical: he looks to varieties of regimes and seeks the best practicable order. Cicero translates ethical theory into the language of Roman republican duty and public example. These differences map onto enduring modern contrasts: utopian reform versus pragmatic reform; elite moral education versus legal and institutional checks; duty-based republicanism versus rights-focused individualism. Use modern parallels with caution but productively: Plato’s distrust of the mass’s taste in culture echoes contemporary worries about media and schooling; Aristotle’s stress on the middle class as a stabilising force anticipates later political thought on moderation and mixed constitutions; Cicero’s stress on the interplay of honour and utility connects to debates about public office, corruption and civic ethics today.

## Exam technique
Approach source questions by reading the passage carefully for what it explicitly says and for what it implies about the author’s wider programme. In analysing a short extract, identify its central claim, explain how it fits into the author’s broader argument, and consider its limitations or bias. When asked to evaluate, weigh both strengths and weaknesses: show how the text supports its conclusions and where historical context or internal inconsistency weakens the claim. For comparative questions, move beyond surface parallels to explain why authors differ: refer to method (Platonic dialectic, Aristotelian empiricism, Cicero’s rhetorical-practical stance), social context (Athenian philosophical debate versus Roman politics), and textual emphasis (education, constitution, duty). In longer essays, plan a clear line of argument and use the prescribed texts as evidence rather than description. Signal a judgement early, develop balanced argumentation with textual detail, and conclude by synthesising the evidence. Time management is vital: spend the first few minutes making a brief plan, allocate time to source analysis then to essay development, and leave a final five minutes to check clarity and add a short concluding paragraph. Always be precise about command words: “analyse” asks for close reading and unpacking; “evaluate” demands judgement and balance; “compare” requires linked discussion showing both similarities and differences. Finally, use contextual knowledge to explain why an author says what they do, but avoid anachronistic moralising; your strongest answers combine close textual knowledge with comparative judgment and a clear, well-structured argument.
