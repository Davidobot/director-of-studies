# Heroes and heroism (Homer, Virgil, Euripides, Ovid) (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why study heroes?
Heroes occupy the centre of classical literature because they embody and question the values of their societies. In Homer, Virgil, Euripides and Ovid the figure of the hero is never a simple idol: rather, heroic narratives show how honour, duty, cunning and violence work in practice, how they affect ordinary people, and how literary traditions adapt the idea of heroism to new political and moral contexts. For Advanced Higher study you should read the set books not merely as stories but as systems of value. Ask what each author wants readers to admire, to pity, or to reject. Think too about how the presentation of heroism changes between Greek epic, Attic drama, Roman epic and the elegiac/epistolary voice of Ovid: these differences are central to understanding questions of morality, gender, and cultural purpose.

## Homeric heroism: Achilles, Hector and Odysseus
In the Iliad and the Odyssey heroism is rooted in honour, reputation and direct action. Homeric heroes pursue kleos (fame) and are judged by their bravery in battle, prowess in competition, and observance of customs such as guest-friendship. Achilles exemplifies the tension at the heart of epic heroism: his rage in Book 1 of the Iliad springs from wounded honour, and his withdrawal and return raise questions about the costs of glory. Hector, by contrast, combines personal courage with loyalty to family and city; his behaviour in Book 6 is instructive because it shows a hero who balances public duty with private feeling. Odysseus represents another strain of Homeric heroism: his arete is intellectual as well as martial. The Odyssey celebrates craft and endurance, and its hero’s cunning, long-suffering and ability to negotiate social situations make him a model of survival rather than pure battlefield glory. Across the Homeric books under study, gods and fate shape choices: the Olympian gods reward or punish according to their jealousies and preferences, so moral judgement is often tangled with divine favour. When you study these books, pay attention to scenes of speech and action that reveal what each character values, and how the narrator invites the audience to admire or to feel uneasy about those values.

## Virgil and the Roman reworking of heroism
Virgil’s Aeneid deliberately reshapes heroic ideals to fit a Roman agenda. Aeneas is presented as the pious founder: his defining characteristic is pietas, a responsibility to gods, family and future Rome. This does not mean he is uniformly admirable in modern terms; his choices in Book 4 and in the later war scenes complicate the model. The Aeneid stages an important shift from Homeric kleos to Roman duty: heroism becomes collective and teleological, oriented to the destiny of a people rather than to individual renown. At the same time Virgil keeps features of Greek epic—long similes, aristeia-style descriptions, and vivid moral dilemmas—so the reader can compare how similar actions are given different meanings in a new cultural frame. The role of the gods in Virgil is also designed to serve imperial myth: divine interventions often confirm Rome’s future, yet human suffering remains central. Where Homer invites admiration for private excellence, Virgil invites reflection on the cost of empire and the ambiguous ethics of a hero who must sacrifice personal attachments for a national destiny.

## Euripides and Ovid: critique, female voices and anti-heroes
Euripides and Ovid provide crucial counterpoints to epic heroics by amplifying marginal voices and exposing the human consequences of heroic actions. In the Trojan Women Euripides stages the suffering of defeated women after the fall of Troy; the play forces the audience to witness the domestic and moral fallout of supposedly heroic wars. Hecuba, Cassandra and Andromache are not heroic in the epic sense, yet their articulate grief and bitter questions about justice make them moral centres of the drama. Euripides thus invites a re-evaluation of heroic narratives by showing those whom heroism devastates.

Ovid’s Heroides perform a complementary function by giving first-person letters to mythic women, such as Penelope and Sappho in the letters set for study. These voices expose betrayal, abandonment and emotional labour that male-centred epics often ignore. Ovid’s technique—intimate, confessional, ironic—lets students see how the rhetoric of love and complaint can undermine traditional praises of male heroics. Between Euripides’ tragic stage and Ovid’s literary monologue the texts you study show that classical writers were never unanimous in their praise of martial virtue; many were preoccupied with its collateral damage and the ways it sits uncomfortably alongside notions of justice and mercy.

## Key themes: morality, fate, shame and guilt
Across the prescribed texts several recurring themes structure your analysis. Morality in these works is rarely absolute; heroes often act out of competing responsibilities—personal honour, loyalty to comrades, obedience to the gods, or duty to state and family—and different authors weigh those responsibilities differently. Fate and divine will are persistent forces: Homeric heroes struggle against mortal limits while manoeuvring within a world where fate is inexorable. The Aeneid intensifies a sense of historical destiny, making personal sacrifice a virtue for the future good. Another useful distinction is between shame-cultures and guilt-cultures. Homeric society privileges public reputation and shame-avoidance, so heroic deeds are often aimed at securing visible honour. In Virgil there is a gradual move toward guilt and internalised duty: Aeneas must live with choices that he cannot justify to himself simply by the pursuit of glory. The moral complexity of heroism is also revealed by anti-heroic behaviour: cunning that looks like deceit, violence that becomes atrocity, or duty that justifies cruelty. When preparing essays, trace how these themes connect to characterisation and to authorial strategy rather than treating them as abstract ideas.

## The hero as role model, and the place of women
One important line of questioning in this topic asks whether heroes function as role models. In classical societies heroes often set behavioural ideals, but the texts complicate this function. Homeric heroes teach a code of excellence that includes courage, generosity and observance of guest-rights, yet they also display anger, recklessness and selfishness. Virgil’s Aeneas is presented as a model for Roman virtues—duty, endurance, pietas—yet his flawed responses to personal temptation and grief invite critical distance. Euripides and Ovid problematise the model by foregrounding women’s experiences: the Trojan Women exposes the cost to wives, mothers and daughters of male heroics, while the Heroides foreground women’s grievances and desires, showing that classical models of heroism are gendered and often violent in their consequences. Use these texts to ask not simply “who is heroic?” but “for whom does this hero serve as an example?” and “what social groups pay the cost of heroic action?”

## Comparing Greek and Roman views of heroism
Comparative thinking is essential in this option. Greek literary culture gives pride of place to individual excellence, cunning and martial skill, and often accepts the gods’ partiality as part of the social world. Roman epic recasts these values into a language of duty, state-building and ancestry. The practical effect is that the same action—killing an enemy, abandoning a lover, displaying courage in battle—can have different meanings. For example, Achilles’ pursuit of honour may feel personally justified within Homer’s poetic frame, whereas a similar single-mindedness in Virgil can be read as the painful but necessary engine of imperial destiny. When you write comparative answers, show awareness of genre, historical context and authorial purpose: Homeric epic grows from oral heroic tradition; Virgil writes under Augustus with Rome’s future in mind; Euripides writes tragedy that interrogates public values; Ovid plays with elegiac and rhetorical conventions to unsettle expectations.

## Exam technique
Plan your essays carefully. Begin by clarifying the command word: ‘analyse’ asks for close reading and explanation; ‘evaluate’ requires judgements supported by evidence; ‘compare’ demands systematic attention to similarities and differences. For source-based Part A questions, focus on the extract first: identify its literary features, its immediate dramatic or narrative context, and how it exemplifies wider themes in the prescribed book. Use specific moments—scenes of speech, a striking simile, a narrative turn—to support analytic claims, and explain why these moments matter for understanding heroism. When a question asks you to compare a classical text with a modern source, use the modern material as a stimulus: highlight points of intersection and difference, and avoid treating the modern source as mere illustration. In Part B essays you have time for extended argument, so structure your answer with a clear thesis, thematic paragraphs that address counter-arguments, and a concluding judgement that weighs the evidence.

Manage time by allocating roughly equal attention to planning, writing and revision. For a three-hour paper, spend ten to fifteen minutes planning each long answer, using that plan to create topic sentences and signposting. Quote sparingly and precisely: a short line or description will usually support your point better than lengthy quotation. Where possible, integrate textual evidence with contextual points about genre, authorial motive and social background—these connections score highly because they show synthesis.

When comparing Greek and Roman passages, focus on the language of values: what counts as honour, what constitutes duty, and how the community is imagined. Remember also to consider form: epic similes, dramatic choral speech or the epistolary voice all influence how heroism is presented. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions, annotate key passages from the prescribed books so you can recall them quickly in the exam, and develop a short repertoire of comparative points that you can adapt to different questions. Clear argument, textual precision and awareness of differing authorial aims will lift your answers from description to critical evaluation.
