# Classical text analysis and argument writing (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Course at a glance
Higher Classical Studies combines close reading of classical texts with the study of social, political and religious life in ancient Greece and Rome. The course is built around three assessment components: a classical literature question paper, a classical society question paper, and a research-based assignment. You will be expected to read and understand a set text in depth, become confident in interpreting a range of complex sources, and develop sustained, well-reasoned arguments that link the ancient and modern worlds. Time management is important: exam papers are tightly timed, and the assignment includes a research stage plus a short, supervised writing stage where you must use a single A4 resource sheet.

## What you will learn and why it matters
The course aims to deepen your knowledge of religious, political, social, moral and cultural values in classical Greek and Roman societies and to equip you with analytic and communication skills that transfer well beyond the classroom. You will explore universal themes that recur across literature and history—leadership, fate versus free will, heroism, conflict, and the role of women in society—and you will learn to extract and evaluate evidence from drama, poetry, historical accounts and material culture. These skills of source evaluation, structured argument and comparative thinking prepare you for further study in humanities subjects and develop literacy, critical thinking and citizenship. Importantly, the course emphasises comparison: you must be able to contrast classical ideas and institutions with modern equivalents and to explain continuities and differences.

## Classical literature: themes and how to study texts
Classical texts are tested through themes rather than solely plot recall. When you study a set text, aim to understand how characters, structure, language and dramatic convention reveal the theme you are focusing on. For example, Sophocles’ Antigone is an excellent vehicle for exploring leadership and conflict because Creon’s assertion of civic order and Antigone’s assertion of familial duty clash with tragic consequences; looking at their speeches and stage dynamics will help you explain how the play presents competing claims about authority and justice. Oedipus the King offers a controlled framework to discuss fate versus free will, as the plot tightly interweaves prophetic declarations with human action. Medea and sections of Homer’s Odyssey are particularly useful for probing ideas of heroism and the complexities of women’s roles in ancient narratives. Beyond plot, pay attention to genre conventions—Greek drama was written for public performance at religious festivals, so stagecraft, chorus interventions and public rhetoric all shape meaning—and to how later readers might interpret motives and values differently.

When preparing a literature essay, move beyond summary to close textual analysis. Define the theme clearly, select episodes or speeches that best illustrate developments, and explain how language and dramatic effect create meaning. Always make an explicit link to the modern world when required: ask how ancient presentations of leadership, honour or gender illuminate contemporary debates about power, responsibility or social roles.

## Life in Classical Greece and Rome: key topics to master
The society paper examines either power and freedom or religion and belief for Greece and for Rome. For Greece, the focus on fifth-century Athens means you should know how Athenian institutions operated: the Assembly as the sovereign body of citizens, the Council of 500 as the agenda-setting organ, the roles of archons and generals, and mechanisms such as ostracism. Understand eligibility for citizenship, the rights and responsibilities that came with it, and the position of metics and enslaved people. The Athenian legal system, with its large citizen juries, paid jurors, and public trials, also demands attention; be ready to discuss strengths and weaknesses, such as accountability versus susceptibility to demagogy.

Religious life in Greece combined an official state cult with variety in local cults, mystery religions and private devotion. Know the ritual practices—sacrifice, libation, votive offerings—and ceremonial centres such as Delphi and major festivals like the Panathenaia and City Dionysia. Mystery cults such as the Eleusinian mysteries and the cult of Asclepius had different appeals and social functions; consider why these movements attracted followers and how classical thinkers like Plato responded to religious questions about the gods and the afterlife.

For the Roman world, the course centres on the late Republic and the early Empire. Be clear about the structure and perceived virtues and weaknesses of the Republic: SPQR (Senatus Populusque Romanus) as the claim to joint authority of Senate and People; electoral processes and the roles of magistrates from quaestor to consul, and of extraordinary offices such as dictator or tribune. Social hierarchy—patricians, equestrians and plebeians—and the lived realities of enslavement are essential, including forms of enslavement, public and private uses of enslaved people, manumission practices and slave rebellions such as Spartacus. The transformation into empire raises questions of provincial administration, Romanisation and the costs and benefits of imperial rule, illustrated by revolts such as Boudicca’s uprising and the Judean revolts.

Roman religion requires attention both to public cults—augurs, pontiffs, Vestal Virgins and the imperial cult—and to domestic practices centred on the Lares, Penates and the household genius. Festival culture, divinatory practice and philosophical responses to religion—Stoicism and Epicureanism—are all examinable. Mystery religions such as Mithraism and the cult of Isis invite discussion of religious choice and tolerance in the Roman world, including different Roman responses to Judaism and early Christianity.

## Sources, evidence and argument—how to use them
A key skill in this course is interpreting and evaluating sources. Sources include literary texts, inscriptions, archaeological remains, and later summaries by ancient authors. Always interrogate what a source can and cannot tell you: literary speeches convey attitudes and ideology but may be rhetorical constructs; grave goods and public monuments shed light on material culture but not on private beliefs. When asked to evaluate the usefulness of a source, identify its origin, purpose and perspective, note strengths such as eyewitness detail or archaeological specificity, and point out limitations like bias, genre conventions or chronological distance.

Comparative questions often require you to link an ancient source to a modern quote or idea. Treat the modern item as another source to scrutinise: consider differences in context, scale and values, then weigh similarities and contrasts. Strong answers explicitly synthesise evidence from several sources, explaining how they support or challenge a particular interpretation, and they present balanced conclusions that recognise uncertainty where evidence is ambiguous.

Practice structuring answers so that each paragraph advances a line of argument, uses specific evidence, analyses that evidence in relation to the question, and then links back to the central thesis. In longer essays, plan an introduction that sets out the argument and a conclusion that draws together your main points and discusses wider implications.

## The assignment: planning, research and producing evidence
The assignment lets you investigate an issue of your choice in depth and is assessed externally. You should select a topic that offers clear alternative viewpoints and allows comparison between classical and modern contexts. The assignment has a research stage that may take around eight hours across your course and a supervised production stage of ninety minutes during which you produce the final report using only your completed one-side resource sheet. The resource sheet is limited to 250 words on a single A4 side and must be submitted with the assignment; failure to submit it will incur a penalty.

During the research stage you are expected to gather and evaluate a range of sources, organise your findings and form a reasoned conclusion. Teachers can give reasonable guidance on topic choice and research approaches but must not provide model answers, specific resources to use, or detailed feedback on drafts. You must work independently and ensure your submitted work is your own; keep clear records of sources and draft notes that demonstrate the development of your ideas.

When preparing the production stage, practise condensing your argument and evidence so you can write efficiently under time pressure. The mark scheme rewards clarity of issue definition, depth of research, balanced analysis that recognises counter-arguments, and a well-supported conclusion. Good assignment topics are focused rather than overly broad: for instance, assessing the impact of the use of enslaved people in Athens, analysing fate versus free will in a specific play, or evaluating the benefits of Roman provincial rule. Aim to organise your report so that each paragraph contributes directly to answering your question and draws on the sources you studied.

## Exam technique
Approach each paper with a clear plan. For the classical literature paper, you will choose two extended-response questions: plan introductions that state your interpretation of the theme and outline the evidence you will use. Use close textual detail—quotations, references to scenes or speeches, and discussion of dramatic technique—to support your claims, and avoid long passages of plot summary. For the shorter comparative question, read the modern quote carefully and treat it as a source: compare its assumptions to those in the classical text and draw a balanced conclusion about how similar or different the two perspectives are.

In the classical society paper you must answer questions across Greek and Roman sections. Expect source evaluation questions that test your ability to assess provenance and usefulness, and longer essay-style questions that require thematic analysis or to what extent evaluations. Allocate time so that you address each part thoroughly: read all questions before choosing, annotate sources quickly to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses, and plan essays with a brief outline of points and supporting evidence. For “how fully do sources A, B and C…” questions, structure an answer that summarises what each source claims, weighs their collective evidence, contrasts any discrepancies, and concludes with an overall judgement about the extent to which the sources provide a complete picture.

Timing matters: practise writing under timed conditions, allocating minutes per mark so you do not run out of time on high-value questions. In the assignment production stage, write a concise, well-signposted report that follows the structure you practised during research: clear statement of the issue, summary of evidence, discussion of alternative interpretations and counter-arguments, direct classical–modern comparison, and a reasoned conclusion. Throughout every assessment, aim for clarity, precise language, and explicit links between evidence and conclusion; examiners reward answers that demonstrate depth of knowledge, thoughtful evaluation, and an ability to synthesize evidence into a coherent argument.
