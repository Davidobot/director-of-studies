# Women in Athens and Rome: roles and status (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: scope and overview
Studying women in Athens and Rome illuminates how gender, class and law combined to shape everyday life and public culture in the classical world. In fifth‑century BC Athens and in the Roman world of the first century BC/AD women occupied clearly defined roles but experienced those roles in very different ways depending on social status, citizenship and whether they were free or enslaved. This overview focuses on legal position and political exclusion, domestic responsibilities and sexuality, economic activities and education, religious functions and public cults, and the particular experiences of enslaved and freedwomen. Throughout, it is important to remember diversity: elite Athenian and Roman matrons had different lives from rural women, metics and enslaved women. Comparative thinking about modern gender roles and legal protections will help make sense of continuities and contrasts across time.

## Legal and political status
In both Athens and Republican/imperial Rome, women were broadly excluded from formal political power: they did not vote or hold civic office in the way male citizens did. In Athens the ideal citizen was male and political participation took place in institutions—the Assembly, the Council and the courts—that women were excluded from. Athenian women were usually under the legal authority of a kyrios, a male guardian, typically a father, husband or close male relative. This guardian arranged marriages and acted for the woman in legal transactions and in the courts; women rarely appeared as litigants without a male representative. Certain legal mechanisms, such as the epikleros (a daughter who inherited in the absence of male heirs), show, however, that Athenian law could create special roles for women where inheritance and the continuation of a male line were at stake.

Roman women in the first century BC and AD lived under a more flexible legal framework. Early Roman marriage forms could place a woman under her husband’s manus, but over the late Republic and into the Empire marriage without manus (sine manu) became increasingly common, allowing women to remain legally attached to their natal family while living with a husband. By the early imperial period some women, especially widows and those who became sui iuris, could own, inherit and manage property in their own name. Despite these legal possibilities, formal political power remained closed: women could not hold magistracies or vote, but they could and did exert influence behind the scenes, through family networks, patronage and cultural authority. Empresses and elite Roman women sometimes shaped policy indirectly, but that influence depended on status, personality and the willingness of male relatives to accept it.

## Family, marriage and childbirth
Marriage and family life were central to both societies, but practices and expectations differed. In Athens marriage was understood primarily as an arrangement to produce legitimate male heirs and to ensure the continuity of the oikos (household). Girls were generally married in their mid‑teens to older men; the ceremony and the handing over of the bride to her husband’s household emphasised the transfer of guardianship. The household tasks of weaving, managing domestic slaves and bearing children defined respectable female roles. Divorce was possible but socially awkward; a woman’s reputation and her dowry were at stake.

In Rome the aims of marriage were similar—legitimacy and inheritance—but family structures evolved so that elite women might maintain greater legal independence. Roman law regulated dowries and marriage settlements, and divorce became relatively straightforward and socially more common than in many later societies. Childbirth was dangerous and central to a woman’s status; high infant mortality and maternal mortality affected family strategies. Augustus’ marriage laws and moral legislation in the early Empire aimed to encourage marriage and childbearing among the elite and penalised adultery, reflecting official anxieties about social order and population among the upper classes.

Both cultures accepted practices now regarded as harsh: infanticide and exposure could occur in the ancient world, particularly where economic or social pressures made rearing unwanted infants difficult. Families used adoption and arranged marriages to secure alliances and property, and these practices show how women’s reproductive roles were intimately tied to broader political and economic strategies.

## Work, economics and education
Women’s economic roles varied widely. In Athens most citizen women did not work outside the home in public roles; their economic contribution to the household was measured through management of the household economy, spinning and textile production, supervising enslaved workers and handling domestic accounts. Some Athenian women, particularly metics (resident foreigners) and those of lower status, engaged in market trading or worked as wet‑nurses, midwives or in small-scale craft activities. Athenian law allowed widows some control over property; they could run estates on behalf of their children or manage dowries.

Roman women tended to have more visible economic freedom. Elite Roman women could inherit wealth, run large households, manage estates, supervise business affairs and in some cases engage directly in commerce, lending and property investment. Urban Roman women might be involved in retail and textile production; freedwomen often ran successful businesses. Education also diverged: in Athens, girls of the elite were trained primarily in domestic skills and social duties, with limited formal literacy for most. In Rome literacy among elite girls was more common; educated Roman women could read, write and participate in literary culture, and some became noted patrons of the arts or authors of letters and poetry. The capacity to manage property and participate in economic life meant that Roman women could amass personal influence and financial independence that many Athenian women did not enjoy.

## Religion and public cult participation
Religious life provided a major sphere in which women had recognised public roles. In Athens women participated in important festivals and cults: priestesses held significant offices, the Panathenaia involved female processional roles, and women led festivals such as the Thesmophoria, which was central to female civic identity and agricultural regeneration. The presence of female religious specialists—priestesses of Athena, Demeter’s cult associations and roles in rites connected to birth and death—shows that religious authority could be a respected and visible outlet for female agency.

In Rome the Vestal Virgins are the most striking example of women who enjoyed exceptional public status and ritual authority. Entrusted with the safety of the sacred fire and important state rites, Vestals occupied a unique legal position and were highly honoured. Other cults such as the Bona Dea involved female-only ritual space, and some imperial cult practices gave women public priestly roles or prominent positions in religious ceremonies. Mystery cults, both Greek and imported, also attracted women, offering spiritual experiences and social networks outside the formal civic sphere. Religious office could therefore be a path to public visibility and influence, though it remained circumscribed by ritual and ideology.

## Enslaved women, freedwomen and the lower orders
The lives of enslaved women and freedwomen provide a crucial corrective to focusing only on elite norms. Enslaved women in Athens were central to household economies as cooks, nurses, textile workers and personal attendants. They were subject to the will of their owners, vulnerable to physical abuse and sexual exploitation, but they could also possess specialised skills and, occasionally, opportunities for manumission. Freedwomen could occupy an ambiguous social space: previously enslaved, they might establish families, run businesses or serve as wet‑nurses, and they often formed important urban communities. In Rome enslaved women worked in domestic service, workshops, agriculture and prostitution; revolts such as the slave uprisings exposed the fragility and volatility of an economy dependent on enslaved labour. The material and documentary evidence, including inscriptions and legal records, makes clear that enslaved and freed women were essential to both economies and that their experiences were shaped by class, gender and legal status rather than just by a single “female” identity.

## Influence, resistance and cultural representations
Women exerted influence in informal and formal ways. Elite Athenian women could influence political affairs indirectly through family alliances, religious patronage or as mothers and wives of powerful men. Literary and theatrical representations—tragic heroines such as Antigone or Medea—explore female agency, moral autonomy and the consequences of transgressing male‑defined norms. In Rome, women like Livia and Agrippina exercised notable political and dynastic influence, shaping succession and policy behind the scenes. Women also resisted constraints: they could refuse marriage, manage households independently, use legal avenues to protect property, and form female networks through religious festivals and social gatherings. These examples reveal that rule‑making and everyday negotiation coexisted, and they invite students to analyse how cultural ideals of femininity and honour intersected with real capacities for action.

## Comparison and modern relevance
Comparing Athens and Rome shows both commonalities and contrasts. Both societies defined public citizenship as male, tied female social worth to marriage and reproduction, and limited women’s formal political rights. Rome, however, generally offered greater property rights and economic opportunities for women, especially by the first century AD, while Athenian women lived under stricter guardianship norms. Regional, social and chronological variations complicate any simple picture: Spartan women, for example, enjoyed more physical freedom and property ownership than their Athenian counterparts. For modern students, exploring how law, religion and economy structured gender expectations is instructive for thinking about contemporary debates on legal equality, workplace participation and the public role of women. Comparing ancient practices with modern norms can be productive if it is done critically, recognising differences in value systems and material conditions and avoiding simplistic judgments.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on women in Athens and Rome, begin by defining the terms and the scope of the question: specify period, place and social group (for example, “Athenian citizen women in the fifth century BC” or “Roman elite women in the first century AD”). Use both literary and material evidence: ancient literature, epigraphic and archaeological sources, and legal arrangements provide complementary perspectives. Always explain internal diversity—distinguish between citizens, metics, enslaved people and freedpeople—and note regional variants such as Sparta. Where a question asks for evaluation, weigh strengths and weaknesses of sources: consider the bias of male authors, the elite focus of many surviving texts, and how archaeology can confirm or complicate written accounts. For comparative questions, structure answers so that one paragraph deals with Athens, another with Rome, and a final paragraph draws out similarities, differences and an overall judgement.

In source‑based questions, analyse provenance and purpose before using a source as evidence. Link specific examples to broader arguments: mention the kyrios system and epikleros in Athens to discuss legal guardianship; discuss cum manu and sine manu marriage forms or the role of the Vestal Virgins for Rome to show legal and ritual differences. For assignment work, plan research carefully, evaluate a range of secondary and primary materials, and prepare a concise resource sheet that summarises your argument and key references. Time management is vital in exams: spend the first few minutes planning, allocate time according to mark values, and leave a few minutes to proofread. Finally, in conclusions, be precise and evidence‑based: draw together strands of analysis to reach a balanced, supported judgement rather than a general summary.
