# Comparing classical and modern societies (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why compare classical and modern societies?
Comparing classical Greek and Roman societies with the modern world is not an exercise in nostalgia or simple nostalgia-driven admiration; it is a disciplined way of understanding the origins and evolution of ideas, institutions and values that shape contemporary life. The advanced study of classical societies asks you to read literature and history not as remote curiosities but as sources that illuminate questions we still face: how should communities be organised, what makes a good leader, how do stories of the past shape identity, and what role does satire play in public debate? Approaching these topics comparatively trains the critical skills of analysis, evaluation and synthesis: you learn to interrogate evidence, weigh competing explanations, and construct sustained arguments that move beyond description to judgement.

## History and historiography: evidence, purpose and bias
Studying historians such as Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Livy and Tacitus gives you direct access to how the classical world thought about the past. These writers differ markedly in method and purpose. Herodotus collects a wide variety of reports and allows digressions that preserve local stories and customs, leaving the reader to judge reliability. Thucydides treats evidence more critically and aims for analytical narrative, framing events like the Peloponnesian War as lessons in power and human nature. Polybius combines documentary records, eyewitness testimony and pragmatic analysis to explain Rome’s rise, while Livy often reshapes sources to give moral examples and Tacitus interprets events through his personal experience and political scepticism.

When comparing classical and modern historiography, focus on three linked questions: what kind of evidence is used, why is the history written, and how do authorial choices shape meaning? Modern historians often aim for methodological reflexivity—explicit discussion of sources, context and biases—whereas classical authors sometimes make their purposes overt in different ways, for example by using set speeches to insert interpretation or moral commentary. The comparative task in exams requires you to evaluate not only factual reliability but also the uses of history across times: classical histories might aim to instruct, to justify political order, or to explain causation; modern histories may emphasise complexity, counter-narratives or social structures. Be prepared to analyse passages for what they reveal about evidence and motive, and to contrast those techniques with modern approaches to memory, archival standards and the ethics of historical argument.

## Individual and community: political thought and civic life
Plato, Aristotle and Cicero provide the best classical starting points for questions about how individuals relate to their communities. Plato’s Republic imagines a structured city ordered by justice and by a programme of moral and intellectual education; its radical proposals for the division of labour and guarded guardians prompt modern readers to ask uncomfortable questions about equality and social engineering. Aristotle treats the polis as a natural association aimed at the good life, analysing constitutions and warning of the slide from good to corrupt regimes; his comparative emphasis on types of government gives a conceptual vocabulary for comparing ancient and modern political forms. Cicero writes as a statesman and moralist, emphasising duties, honour and the place of law and rhetoric in public life.

To compare these classical views with modern ideas, consider three themes: citizenship, rights and obligations. Classical texts often stress duties and civic identity rooted in status, family and habit, whereas modern societies foreground notions of individual rights, legal protections and universal citizenship. However, the distinction is not absolute. Discussions of civic virtue, the balance of private interest and public good, and the tensions between equality and hierarchy are common to both periods. In answers, illustrate arguments with concrete contrasts: the communal rites and exclusionary practices of Athens and Rome versus modern franchise extensions and human-rights frameworks, and the continuing debates about the place of education or public service in forming responsible citizens.

## Heroes and heroism: changing ideals and gendered perspectives
The Homeric epics, Virgil’s Aeneid, Euripides’ Trojan Women and Ovid’s Heroides offer a rich tableau for thinking about heroism. In Homer, heroism is often bound up with honour, glory on the battlefield and reciprocal obligations to comrades and guests. By the time of Virgil, Roman heroism is reshaped into a political and moral project that supports public order and imperial destiny; Aeneas embodies pietas as well as martial prowess, reflecting a different set of priorities. Tragic and elegiac voices complicate heroic ideals: Euripides and Ovid show how heroic wars impose suffering, often exposing the costs to women and non-combatants.

In comparing classical and modern notions of heroism, examine how societies valorise different attributes. Modern heroes can be civilians, moral leaders, scientists or activists rather than primarily martial figures; modern media changes how heroes are constructed and consumed, and heroism becomes subject to critique—celebrated for courage and service but also questioned for complicity in violence or propaganda. Pay attention to gender: classical narratives often marginalise women’s perspectives, which some classical authors nonetheless foreground in order to critique male-dominated heroic codes. When writing, use textual examples to show how heroic ideals shift and how the “hero” functions as a cultural role model or cautionary figure in each period.

## Comedy, satire and society: public critique and its limits
Aristophanes, Horace and Juvenal represent two distinct but related traditions of social commentary. Athenian Old Comedy uses exaggerated characters, grotesque plots and direct lampooning of public figures to debate war, leadership and morality in a civic setting. Roman satire, in the hands of Horace and Juvenal, becomes a more reflective and often darker meditation on social decay, ambition, luxury and the search for peace of mind. Both traditions use humour, stereotype and invective as tools to expose hypocrisy, but they differ in tone and social context: Athenian comedy participates in democratic contestation, while Roman satire often laments the loss of old values in an empire of social mobility and luxury.

To draw modern comparisons, consider how contemporary satire operates in print, broadcast and online media. Modern satire inherits classical conventions—caricature, irony, moral outrage—but functions in a changed legal and communicative environment. Free press and social media expand reach but also complicate the public effects of satire: what was once a civic corrective can be polarising or easily manipulated. In essays, discuss the ambitions and limitations of social critique in both worlds, showing how literary form shapes the persuasive power and potential dangers of satire.

## Research skills and the project–dissertation: planning, sources and argument
The project–dissertation is your opportunity to practise independent scholarship: choosing a focused, complex issue, justifying it, researching widely and producing a sustained, referenced argument of 3,000–4,000 words. A successful project begins with careful planning. Narrow your question so that it demands qualitative judgement rather than wide narrative. Identify three or four subsidiary questions that structure your chapters and make sure each element contributes to an overall conclusion. Early conversations with your teacher about scope and sources will save time and prevent unnecessary revisions.

Sources should include a balanced mix of primary texts and modern academic secondary literature. Primary evidence ranges from literary texts to inscriptions, coins, and material culture; secondary literature includes scholarly books and peer-reviewed articles that offer interpretative frameworks. Online resources are useful but must be critically evaluated for authority, date and purpose. Keep careful records of every source and precise page references to support accurate footnotes and bibliography. Ethical scholarship means acknowledging assistance and including a completed word count. Regular checkpoints—planning, annotated bibliography, draft submission—help authenticate your work and demonstrate the development of a coherent line of argument. In your writing, aim for clarity and formal academic tone, use subheadings if they help logical progression, and ensure that quotations are judicious and well-integrated.

## Exam technique
Understanding the structure and expectations of the course assessment is essential for effective revision and exam performance. The question paper is divided into four optional sections, each containing Part A on classical literature and Part B on classical society. Part A typically asks you to analyse and evaluate classical sources and to compare classical texts with a modern stimulus; Part B involves longer essay-style questions that require analysis, evaluation and synthesis. Time management is crucial: you have three hours, and it is important to plan how long to spend on source analysis versus extended essays. Read each question carefully to identify command words such as “analyse,” “evaluate,” and “compare,” and make sure your response matches the required task.

When tackling source analysis, start by identifying the source’s purpose, viewpoint and context, then move to close reading of language and argument. Pair evidence from the extract with your wider knowledge of the author and genre, and always explain why the extract matters to the question. For comparative questions, establish clear criteria for comparison—such as motive, audience, method or values—and apply them consistently to the classical and modern materials. In extended essays, open with a concise thesis that answers the question and outlines the structure of your argument. Each paragraph should develop a single idea linked to evidence; transitions should show how points build towards your conclusion. Use historians and theorists judiciously to support evaluation, but avoid over-reliance on quotation. Remember that assessment rewards reasoned judgement and sustained argument as much as factual knowledge.

Practice under timed conditions, use past papers and specimen questions to familiarise yourself with marking expectations, and seek feedback focused on argument structure and use of evidence. For the project–dissertation, adhere strictly to word limits and referencing conventions, and keep a clear audit trail of supervision and drafts. Good preparation combines disciplined revision of texts, regular essay practice, careful planning of independent research and a clear understanding of how to turn knowledge into argument in the exam setting.
