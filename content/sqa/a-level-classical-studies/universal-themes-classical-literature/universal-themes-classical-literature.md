# Universal themes in classical literature (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: what counts as a universal theme
Classical literature — Greek tragedy and epic, Roman epic and prose histories, and the surviving dramas and poetry — repeatedly returns to a small set of human concerns that we still recognise today. The SQA specification highlights five themes in particular: leadership, fate versus free will, heroism, conflict and women in society. Treating these as "universal" helps you to focus close textual analysis on wider questions: what does a text suggest about human nature, political life, social roles or moral values, and how do those suggestions compare with our modern assumptions? A useful revision habit is to read each chosen text with the theme in mind, collecting quotations and stage directions or narrative moments that illuminate the theme, and noting how different genres present it (for example, epic’s long similes and catalogue scenes present heroism differently from the concentrated moral dilemmas of tragedy).

## Leadership: rulers, authority and the public good
Leadership in classical texts can be personal and dramatic — the king, general or ruler on stage — and institutional — the workings of Athenian democracy or the Roman Senate. In tragedy, think of Creon in Sophocles’ Antigone whose law-first leadership produces moral catastrophe; in epic, Aeneas exemplifies pietas and the duties of leadership in Virgil’s Aeneid, while Homer’s kings balance personal glory with responsibilities to their men. In civic history and political writing, the nature and limits of rule are analysed: authors such as Thucydides and Livy probe the successes and failures of democratic or republican systems. When you write on leadership, consider both qualities and consequences: what virtues does the text praise (courage, wisdom, restraint), what behaviours does it criticise (hubris, selfishness, short-term thinking), and how are institutions depicted as supporting or undermining good leadership? Always link concrete moments — a decree, a speech, a failed decision — to the text’s broader view of what makes leaders effective or dangerous.

## Fate versus free will: gods, destiny and human responsibility
Questions of fate and choice lie at the heart of many classical narratives. Greek tragedy often stages the tension most starkly: Oedipus’ story raises the problem of divine prophecy and human ignorance, while Sophocles’ dramatists force audiences to ask whether characters are punished by fate or by their own decisions. In Roman literature the theme is often coupled with pietas and destiny as instruments of Rome’s historical mission: Aeneas accepts a divine program, yet his actions shape human outcomes. Philosophical texts and historiography complicate the picture: Stoic and Epicurean thought offer competing views on determinism and moral agency. In essays, demonstrate how the text uses elements such as prophecy, oracles, dreams, and the gods’ interventions to frame human action, and then analyse the extent to which characters are portrayed as morally responsible. To make your point persuasive, bring in close readings of speeches or narrative descriptions and link them to the play’s or poem’s final judgment on guilt and responsibility.

## Heroism and conflict: individual glory and communal cost
Heroism in the ancient world often combines courage, skill and honour, but the literature also interrogates its costs. Homeric heroes pursue kleos (glory) and exhibit physical excellence, yet the Iliad also shows how war destroys families and homes. Tragedy explores inner heroism — moral courage in the face of social pressure — as with Antigone’s refusal to abandon familial duty. Roman texts place heroism within civic frameworks: the republican ideal admired military virtue but was wary of individuals who accumulated excessive power. Conflict, whether interpersonal, civic or international, is both subject and method in classical literature. When analysing these themes, attend to different registers of conflict: public battles, courtroom disputes, domestic clashes. Show how the text stages conflict to test values, produce meaning and reveal consequences, and use specific episodes—battle scenes, rhetorical confrontations, moments of personal sacrifice—to support your interpretation.

## Women in society: roles, agency and representation
Women’s roles in classical literature and society are multi-faceted and often contradictory. Texts present women as religious functionaries, domestic managers, wives and mothers, but also as powerful ritual figures like the Pythia or mythic women who subvert norms, such as Medea. In Athens and Rome women’s legal and political rights were restricted, and literature reflects contemporary anxieties about female agency. Tragedy offers particularly rich material for study because it places female characters at the center of moral crises: Antigone and Medea challenge male authority, while Epic and historiography may marginalise women’s voices yet provide evidence for their social roles. In essays, analyse how the text constructs gender: what actions are women allowed, what punishments or sanctions do they face, and how does the author’s portrayal reflect or question real social arrangements such as marriage customs, religious roles (priestesses, Vestal Virgins) and economic limits? Compare literary representation with archaeological or documentary evidence when possible to show how literary stereotypes map onto social reality.

## Using sources and comparing classical with modern worlds
Classical Studies asks you to read literary texts alongside historical and material evidence. Develop the habit of assessing a source’s content, provenance, purpose and limitations. For a literary passage ask who is speaking, why, and how theatrical conventions shape the message; for a historical source consider authorship, date and audience: Thucydides’ realism, Aristotle’s prescriptive politics, Livy’s moralising history and Tacitus’ critical senatorial viewpoint all influence what they choose to report and why. Archaeological material and inscriptions offer different kinds of evidence: they are often less interpretative but come with their own silences and gaps. When you compare classical and modern worlds, you are being asked to draw parallels and contrasts. A good comparison does not simply impose modern values on the ancient text but shows specific points of connection — for example, comparing Athenian citizen participation with modern democratic practice, or comparing ancient religious tolerance and modern secular pluralism. Use examples to support claims and qualify your comparisons by noting differences in social scale, literacy, and political structure that limit direct equivalence.

## Exam technique
Exam success depends on planning, evidence and clear argument. Begin every essay with a brief introduction that defines the theme you will address, states a clear line of argument, and outlines the areas you will cover. Use paragraphing that begins with a topic sentence, follows with specific evidence (quotations, stage directions, narrative detail, or reference to a source), analyses that evidence closely, and then links it back to your central thesis. For SQA-style questions, time management is crucial: the Classical Literature paper is shorter and requires choosing two questions from three, usually with two 20-mark essays and one 10-mark comparison, so practise answering longer and shorter questions under timed conditions. For the Classical Society paper, be ready to tackle source-based tasks: when asked to evaluate the usefulness of a source, discuss its provenance, content, and what it can and cannot tell us; when asked to compare a modern quote with a classical idea, identify points of agreement and difference, supported by concrete classical examples and by assessing the modern source’s assumptions. In longer evaluative essays use a balance of description, analysis and judgement; show you can weigh evidence and consider counter-arguments before reaching a reasoned conclusion.

For the assignment, choose an issue that invites genuine debate and that you can research across a range of sources. Use the research phase to collect varied evidence—literary texts, historians, archaeology, inscriptions, and modern scholarship—and to note counter-arguments. The resource sheet you submit is limited to a single A4 side and 250 words, so it must contain concise references and a clear plan: a thesis statement, key quotations and the strongest pieces of evidence. During the production of evidence stage you will have 1 hour 30 minutes under controlled conditions, so write a focused, well-structured report that begins with your question, summarises your evidence, evaluates its reliability and relevance, compares classical and modern perspectives, and ends with a balanced conclusion.

Finally, practise under exam conditions, read your chosen texts closely and repeatedly, attend to language and context, and build exemplars for each theme so you can bring precise evidence to every question. Learning to balance close textual detail with broader argument and to make careful, qualified comparisons with the modern world will give you the confidence to respond flexibly to whatever the exam asks.
