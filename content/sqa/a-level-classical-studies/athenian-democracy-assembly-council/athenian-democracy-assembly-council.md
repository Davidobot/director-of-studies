# Athenian democracy: citizens, Assembly and Council (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview of Athenian democracy and direct rule
Athenian democracy in the fifth century BC is best understood as a system of direct political participation by a defined body of citizens. Unlike modern representative democracies, where voters choose delegates to make decisions on their behalf, Athens relied on citizens attending assemblies, speaking, debating and voting on questions of policy, war, law and finance. This system combined institutions chosen by lot with elected officials, regular public scrutiny of magistrates, and procedures intended to prevent the accumulation of personal power. It was pragmatic and performance-based: decisions could be made quickly in response to events, and accountability came through the threat of prosecution, review and, in extreme cases, exile. To grasp how the whole system functioned it helps to start with who counted as a citizen, and then to follow how decisions were prepared in the Council and then decided in the Assembly.

## Citizens: qualifications, exclusions and the role of metics
Citizenship in classical Athens was a narrow, legally defined status. Adult males who met the legal criteria enjoyed full political rights: the ability to speak and vote in the Assembly, to hold public office, to serve on juries and to participate in the civic life of the polis. Over the course of the fifth century the legal definition of citizen tightened. One famous change required that both parents be Athenians, a rule introduced to limit the expansion of the citizen body. Women, enslaved people and resident foreigners were excluded from political citizenship. Metics — resident non-citizen foreigners — formed an important, visible class in the city. They could live and work in Athens, pay taxes, and were subject to the law, and they could even be required to perform military service; yet they lacked political rights such as voting or holding most public offices. This division shaped everyday life: the economic and social fabric of Athens relied on the labour and skills of non-citizens, even as political power was carefully guarded by a comparatively small male citizenry. The exclusion of women and enslaved people from citizenship meant that, despite the label “democracy,” power remained limited in scope and demographic reach.

## Rights, duties and incentives for citizen participation
Membership of the citizen body brought practical privileges and responsibilities. Citizens were expected to take part in the defence of the polis, serve on juries, contribute to liturgies (public financial burdens undertaken by the wealthy), and attend the Assembly. To enable broader participation, the state introduced measures such as pay for jury service and for attendance at certain offices. Payment for jurors was particularly significant because it allowed poorer citizens to participate in justice without sacrificing their livelihood; it also helped to make the courts a central arena of popular power. In return for rights and pay, citizens accepted duties of military service and civic engagement. The system relied on active involvement: the more citizens who attended the Assembly and juries, the stronger claims the decisions made could claim to be the will of the polis. At the same time, incentives such as remuneration carried consequences, including higher cost to the polis and the potential for political manipulation of salaried roles.

## The Assembly (Ekklesia): structure, powers and practice
The Assembly was the sovereign decision-making body of Athens where citizens could gather to debate and decide policy. Meeting regularly at places such as the Pnyx or other public venues, the Assembly addressed the widest range of issues: declarations of war, peace treaties, legislation, election or ostracism proposals, and ratification of Council business. Participation was open to all qualified male citizens, though in practice attendance varied with the issue and with social constraints. Decisions were generally taken by majority vote, often by voice or by raised hands, and at times by division. The Assembly’s powers were extensive because it set policy and provided the final word on many matters. Its openness encouraged vigorous oratory and persuasion; political speakers, whether magistrates, generals or influential citizens, played a decisive role in shaping decisions. Yet the Assembly was not unregulated: procedures such as formal proposals, time-limited debates and legal checks existed to structure discussion and to enable review of illegal or harmful decrees at a later date.

## The Council of 500 (Boule): preparation, administration and the prytany system
The Council of 500, or Boule, functioned as the administrative engine of Athenian democracy and as the principal preparatory body for the Assembly. Composed of 500 citizens drawn by lot — fifty from each of the ten tribes — the Council served for a year and handled day-to-day government, supervised public finances, prepared the agenda for the Assembly and oversaw the execution of its decrees. The use of sortition for Council membership reflected a democratic impulse to prevent entrenched elites and to give ordinary citizens public responsibility. The Council’s work was organised through the prytany system: each tribe’s fifty councillors took turns (for roughly a tenth of the year) as the presiding committee, managing the daily business and calling meetings. This rotating presidency concentrated executive duties briefly on a small group, enabling continuity of administration without creating permanent executive offices. The Boule also received foreign envoys, supervised magistrates’ activities and monitored emergencies, making it an indispensable intermediary between the everyday workings of the state and the sovereign Assembly.

## How Assembly and Council interacted, and mechanisms of control
The relationship between Council and Assembly determined how decisions moved from proposal to policy. The Boule took initiative by examining proposals, drawing up preliminary motions and vetting legal and financial implications; it then placed agreed items before the Assembly. This filtering role made the Council crucial: it shaped which matters reached popular debate and provided practical groundwork for effective decision-making. At the same time, the Assembly retained ultimate authority and could overrule the Council. Accountability was a defining feature of the system: magistrates and generals were subject to scrutiny, review and, if necessary, legal action at the end of their terms. Additional legal mechanisms, such as procedures for challenging illegal proposals and the annual opportunity to ostracise an individual seen as dangerously powerful, served as checks on ambition. The combination of public debate, legal challenge and short, rotating tenures created a culture in which public office was both a privilege and an exposure to judgement.

## Strengths and weaknesses of the Assembly-Council model
The Athenian model offered several clear strengths. Its direct nature encouraged civic engagement and made leaders accountable to ordinary citizens. Sortition and short terms reduced the opportunities for long-term accumulation of power, while payment for jury service broadened participation. The Boule’s preparatory work made the Assembly’s decisions practicable and helped the city manage complex affairs. However, the system also had notable weaknesses. Political decisions relied heavily on oratory and persuasion, creating space for demagoguery and emotionally charged choices rather than considered deliberation. The exclusion of women, enslaved people and metics meant that the citizen body did not represent the full population, so its decisions embodied a partial, often self-interested perspective. Lot-based selection could place inexperienced individuals in crucial administrative roles, and mechanisms like ostracism could be used for political vendettas as easily as for protection against tyranny. In moments of crisis, the need for rapid popular consent could produce risky strategic choices, especially when combined with the Assembly’s openness to persuasion and the unpredictability of attendance.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Athenian citizens, the Assembly and the Council, begin by defining key terms concisely: who qualified as a citizen, what is meant by direct democracy, and the distinct roles of the Boule and the Ekklesia. A clear definition early on anchors your argument. Structure your answer so that description and explanation come first — explain how institutions worked in practice — and then move to analysis: assess strengths and weaknesses and show awareness of competing interpretations or practical consequences. Use specific institutional details to support points: mention sortition for the Council, the prytany rotation, payment for jurors, the Assembly’s broad competences, and legal checks such as review procedures and ostracism. Where a question asks for evaluation, weigh the positive and negative aspects and judge their overall impact on Athenian political life; avoid simply listing pros and cons without synthesis. In comparative or source-based questions, bring in relevant classical evidence or well-known historical episodes to illustrate how the institutions operated (for example, decisions taken in wartime or high-profile prosecutions), but focus on how the example illuminates the question asked. Time management is essential: plan a brief outline, allocate time for written development and leave a few minutes to write a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Finally, use precise terminology, link paragraphs logically, and make sure every paragraph contributes toward answering the question rather than merely describing background material.
