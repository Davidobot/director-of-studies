# Advanced Higher essay-writing and exam technique (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What the course and assessment expect of you
Advanced Higher Classical Studies asks you to move from knowing facts to thinking like a scholar. The course examines the beliefs, institutions and literature of classical Greece and Rome in depth and asks you to analyse, evaluate and synthesise a wide range of evidence. Assessment has two parts: a three-hour question paper worth two thirds of the total mark, and a project–dissertation worth the remaining third. The question paper is organised into four optional sections — History and historiography; Individual and community; Heroes and heroism; and Comedy, satire and society — and each section divides into Part A (classical literature, 50 marks) and Part B (classical society, 50 marks). The dissertation is an extended piece of independent research between 3,000 and 4,000 words that must show a sustained, coherent line of argument and sound use of sources. Throughout both exam and coursework you will be required to analyse source material, evaluate interpretations, compare classical and modern perspectives and construct reasoned, well-structured arguments.

## Choosing and structuring your essays
A successful essay begins with a clear sense of the question and ends with a reasoned conclusion. Start every answer by defining terms and setting the context: if a question asks you to assess whether Tacitus is a reliable historian, explain what “reliable” might mean in this context and what Tacitus’ aims were. State your stance early, even if you intend to qualify it. Each paragraph should open with a topic sentence that links directly back to your thesis and then develop with focused evidence and analysis. Avoid long stretches of narrative or paraphrase; every detail should serve the argument. For comparative and 15-mark modern-classical questions, signpost explicitly when you switch between sources and when you draw a comparison; the marker needs to see not just what you know but how you are using it to answer the specific command word.

## How to use and evaluate sources
Primary authors and texts are central to Advanced Higher work, but they are not straightforward windows on the past. Treat each source as a constructed argument with purposes, audiences and limitations. For historians such as Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Livy and Tacitus, consider how each writer treats evidence, where they place speeches, and whether myth or moralising shapes their account. For literary texts like Homer, Euripides, Virgil and Aristophanes, attend to narrative voice, conventional forms and the social assumptions beneath the action. When you evaluate a source, move beyond “this source is biased” and explain why bias arises, how it skews interpretation and what other sources say in response. Triangulate: compare the way an event or character is presented across texts, and bring in archaeological, epigraphic or modern scholarly evidence where appropriate to strengthen or qualify your judgment.

## Referencing, quotation and academic tone
Advanced Higher demands an academic register and clear referencing. Use quotations sparingly: short, well-chosen phrases can illustrate a point but large blocks of quotation add little credit. Always attribute views and facts to their sources, and use a consistent referencing system. Footnotes should be reserved for supplementary comments and precise citations; the bibliography should separate primary texts, secondary works and online resources, and captions for images should give full details. In your dissertation and in longer exam answers, use formal phrasing rather than conversational markers: avoid “I think” in favour of phrases such as “this evidence suggests” or “the argument is strongest where…”. Clear, concise academic prose makes it easy for the marker to follow your line of thought.

## Planning and delivering the project–dissertation
Choosing the right dissertation topic is as important as the research itself. An appropriate issue is analytical and evaluative rather than merely descriptive: questions phrased “How far…?”, “To what extent…?”, “How justified is the view…?”, or a comparative formulation invite the kind of judgement and synthesis required. Early planning should identify three or four central sub-issues that will structure your chapters and avoid scattering effort across too many small points. Use a programme of research with regular checkpoints agreed with your supervisor, and keep a research log to record sources and how you used them. You are expected to work with minimum support; teachers may advise on scope and resources but the final dissertation must be your own work. Word count is strictly 3,000–4,000 words excluding references and appendices, and a penalty applies if your final piece exceeds the limit by more than 10 per cent. Aim for clarity of argument, critical engagement with scholarship, accurate referencing and a conclusion that synthesises the evidence rather than merely summarising it.

## Developing the comparative and thematic skills
Across all four optional areas you will be expected to draw out continuities and contrasts between Greek and Roman material and between classical and modern perspectives. In History and historiography, practise comparing Herodotus’ broad, digressive gathering of tales with Thucydides’ tighter analytical narrative and Polybius’ concern with sources and causation. In Individual and community, put Plato and Aristotle in conversation: consider how Plato’s account of justice and education in the Republic compares with Aristotle’s more empirical treatment of constitutions and households, and how Cicero’s political ethics engage with Roman practice. For Heroes and heroism, work on shifting values: contrast Homeric kleos and the shame culture with Virgil’s emphasis on pietas and the more introspective guilt culture in the Aeneid, and use texts such as Euripides’ Trojan Women or Ovid’s Heroides to explore female perspectives and anti-heroic critique. In Comedy and satire, study dramatic and satiric conventions and learn to identify targets and rhetorical strategies, whether Aristophanes’ lampooning of politicians in plays such as Knights and Clouds or Juvenal and Horace’s probing of Roman mores and anxieties. The most persuasive essays interweave thematic insight with close reading of specific passages.

## Revision practice and time management
Effective revision combines content mastery with disciplined practice. Learn and annotate key passages from each prescribed text so that you can deploy them precisely under exam conditions. Build short notes that extract interpretative claims, typical lines of argument and characteristic features of each author. Practice past paper questions under timed conditions and review your answers against published marking instructions, paying attention to what constitutes analysis, evaluation and synthesis at Advanced Higher level. For coursework, set interim deadlines and use supervisor meetings to check focus and evidence rather than to seek direct feedback on draft wording. In the run-up to the exam, create quick-reference sheets: a one-page summary of each author’s aims, methods and typical biases; a list of strong illustrative quotations; and brief comparative maps that pair up passages or ideas across authors to save time when you are writing.

## Exam technique
Approach the three-hour paper with a clear plan. The paper is divided into Part A and Part B; each is worth 50 marks. Allocate your time so that you have roughly equal time for each half: for example, spend about ninety minutes on Part A and ninety minutes on Part B, leaving a short period at the start and finish of the exam to plan and review. In Part A you will typically face a 10-mark analysis, a 10-mark evaluation, a 15-mark comparison of two classical sources and a 15-mark source-based comparison between classical and modern material. For a ten-mark question aim to spend around twelve to fifteen minutes, beginning with a concise definition and a one-sentence thesis, followed by two or three well-developed points each rooted in close textual evidence. For a fifteen-mark question allow twenty to twenty-five minutes and plan a short introduction, two substantial comparative paragraphs that balance similarities and differences with textual support, and a concluding sentence that answers the question directly. Part B requires you to answer two 25-mark essays from a choice; treat each as a mini-dissertation. Spend around forty to fifty minutes on each 25-mark answer, planning before you write. A strong opening will define parameters, outline the line of argument and signpost the essay’s structure. Develop a sustained line of argument through coherent paragraphs that move from analysis to evaluation, bring in comparative material where relevant, and conclude with a judgement that follows logically from the evidence you have discussed. Command words matter: “analyse” asks for detailed examination of methods and evidence; “evaluate” requires weighing strengths and limits and reaching a balanced conclusion; “compare” demands explicit cross-textual links; and “discuss” invites a sustained argument with consideration of alternatives. Throughout, use precise references to texts and passages rather than general summary, and reserve direct quotations for moments when the phrasing itself is analytically significant. Leave a few minutes at the end of the paper to read through your answers, tighten wording and ensure that your conclusions are clearly stated. Practised planning, disciplined time allocation and a focus on analysis, evaluation and synthesis will transform knowledge into high-scoring answers.
