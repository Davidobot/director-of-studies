# Source analysis: attitudes to evidence and bias (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why attitudes to evidence matter
When studying the classical world at Advanced Higher level, sources are not simply repositories of facts to be reported. They are crafted texts that reflect the aims, methods and priorities of their authors. Understanding an author’s attitude to evidence and the kinds of bias that may shape their narrative is essential for analysing, evaluating and synthesising material in essays and the project–dissertation. Close reading of how historians and literary authors present events, select detail, shape speeches and deploy myth can reveal not only what they thought happened, but why they wanted their readers to think in particular ways. This section will guide you through the main ways in which ancient writers treated evidence, how that affects modern interpretation, and how you should respond to such evidence in assessment.

## What counts as evidence in Classical Studies
Evidence in this subject is wide-ranging. It includes written texts such as histories, speeches, philosophic treatises and poetry, but also material remains like inscriptions, coins, monuments and archaeological reports, and visual sources such as vase-painting or statuary. Each type carries its own limitations and affordances. A speech in a historian’s narrative is rarely a verbatim report of what was said; an inscription may record an official version of events; an archaeological assemblage can tell us about diet or trade but not motive. Recognising these different forms of evidence and their peculiarities helps you to weigh their reliability. Good source analysis shows that you can move between types of evidence, use them to corroborate or challenge literary claims, and explain the strengths and weaknesses of each kind of testimony.

## How major ancient historians approached evidence
Different ancient authors approached evidence in recognisably different ways, and learning these patterns is central to source criticism. Herodotus tends to collect a wide range of testimonies and traditions and to record them with sympathy for human interest and moral lessons, resulting in frequent digressions. His method can preserve valuable ethnographic detail, but it also incorporates hearsay and legend. Thucydides presents a tighter, investigative model: he claims to prefer eyewitness testimony and to subject events to causal analysis, yet he can still impose interpretative frameworks—such as the idea that fear, honour and interest drive state behaviour—which shape his account. Polybius explicitly reflects on methodology, arguing for the use of official documents, eyewitnesses and geographical knowledge; his concern to explain Rome’s rise creates a teleological emphasis that affects selection. Livy combines chronology with moralising and patriotic embellishment; his legends about Rome are chosen to teach Roman virtues as much as to record events. Tacitus, writing in a principled but often suspicious voice about imperial Rome, frequently uses official sources filtered through personal experience and judgement, often presenting characters and motives in sharply negative or ambivalent terms. When you quote or analyse extracts from these writers, note not only factual claims but also how each author gains authority—whether by claiming eyewitness status, appealing to documents, or constructing dramatic speeches.

## Selection, arrangement and the use of speeches
One of the clearest indicators of an author’s attitude to evidence is the way material is selected and arranged. Historians choose what to narrate and what to omit; those choices reveal priorities. A digression may seem irrelevant but can illuminate an author’s moral or didactic aim. Set speeches are another key device. Ancient historians frequently compose or reshape speeches to present an argument about causation, leadership or morality. In Thucydides, speeches are philosophical tools used to explore motivations; in Livy they often dramatise Roman virtues or vices. Rather than dismissing speeches as mere fiction, treat them as a window onto the historian’s interpretation. Ask why a particular speech is placed where it is and what it tells you about the historian’s view of characters and causes. The arrangement of episodes—the inclusion of a mythic origin, a catalogue of wrongs, or a sequence of triumphs and disasters—structures readers’ responses and can be just as important as individual factual claims.

## Myth, legend and the uses of history
The relationship between myth and history in ancient texts is complex and purposeful. Myths and founding legends frequently serve to legitimise institutions, explain social customs or offer moral exemplars. For example, Livy’s use of early Roman legends reinforces collective identity and civic virtues, while Herodotus may record local origin stories to illustrate cultural difference. These elements are not necessarily mistakes to be excised; rather, they are part of how ancient societies understood themselves. As a critical reader, you should distinguish between the functions myths serve and the historian’s attitude to them. Does a writer present legend uncritically, or does he interrogate and rationalise it? Can archaeological or epigraphic evidence confirm or challenge the legendary narrative? Your analysis should show that you can weigh the symbolic and practical value of myth alongside empirical evidence.

## Causes of bias: motive, audience and genre
Bias in ancient sources arises from multiple sources. Authors write with motives—political, moral, literary or personal—that influence what they emphasise. An author’s intended audience also matters: a work addressed to an elite Roman readership will frame events differently from one composed for a pan-Hellenic audience. Genre imposes expectations that shape truth claims; epic poetry celebrates heroic ideals, comedy and satire exaggerate and caricature for effect, while rhetorical works aim to persuade. Personal experience can produce partiality: a senator writing about a Caesar may be predisposed to distrust or admire him. Recognising these pressures helps you explain why an account is partial without simply dismissing it. Good source criticism explains how motive, audience and genre produce particular kinds of evidence and then uses that explanation to judge reliability and relevance.

## Evaluating sources: a practical approach
Evaluating ancient evidence requires a systematic but flexible approach. First, situate the source in time and place: when was it written relative to the events it describes, and what information might the author plausibly have had? Second, identify the source’s purpose and audience; a moralising history has different priorities from a practical chronicle. Third, examine internal consistency and specificity: does the text provide names, dates, places and mechanisms, or does it speak in generalities? Fourth, consider corroboration and contradiction: do other literary, epigraphic or material sources support the account, or do they offer alternative explanations? Fifth, probe authorial voice: are we encountering a reflective analyst, a partisan narrator, or a literary stylist? Finally, evaluate the consequences of bias for causation and interpretation. For example, if Tacitus depicts a governor as corrupt, can you discern whether he is reflecting reliable evidence, rhetorical habit, or a broader ideological critique of imperial power? Applying these steps in sequence produces a balanced and evidenced judgement rather than an unsubstantiated claim of unreliability.

## Using source analysis in your research and writing
In essays and the project–dissertation you must integrate source analysis into argument, not treat it as an add-on. Use your evaluation of reliability to weigh evidence when constructing a line of argument. For instance, when arguing about causes of the Peloponnesian War, you might elect to foreground Thucydides’ explanations for structural reasons while using other testimonies and modern scholarship to test his claims. When handling contradictory sources, present them as competing interpretations and explain which is more persuasive on the evidence and why. Demonstrate an understanding of how selection and arrangement create meaning by citing examples of speeches or digressions and explaining their argumentative function. In the dissertation you should be explicit about methodology: justify the sources you rely upon, discuss limitations, and show how different kinds of evidence are brought together to sustain your conclusions. Careful referencing and transparent use of footnotes will strengthen your credibility and help examiners follow your reasoning.

## Exam technique
In the exam, time management and focused source comment are as important as content knowledge. When presented with an extract, begin by placing it briefly in context—author, date, purpose—then move quickly to analysis of attitudes to evidence: consider the author’s likely sources, the rhetorical devices used, and the motive behind selection and emphasis. If you are asked to evaluate reliability, offer a balanced judgement that weighs corroboration, authorial purpose and genre, and conclude about the degree of confidence you can place in particular claims. When comparing classical and modern sources, show how modern authors’ aims and contexts differ and what that means for comparison. Use specific textual detail to support your points; naming passages, referring to set speeches, or noting documentary claims demonstrates close reading. In longer essays allow separate paragraphs to establish context, analyse source qualities, compare evidence, and synthesize into a coherent conclusion. Avoid sweeping dismissals of ancient sources; instead, show nuanced understanding by explaining precisely where and why a text is trustworthy, where it is partial, and how that affects your overall argument.
