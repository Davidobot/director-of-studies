# Source interpretation and evaluation (archaeological & written) (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why sources matter
Understanding the ancient world depends on handling two broad families of evidence: things people left behind and words people wrote down. Archaeological remains—buildings, pottery, coins, inscriptions, tombs—give material traces of behaviour, economy, ritual and everyday life. Written sources—histories, speeches, plays, legal texts, letters and official decrees—offer narrated perspectives, arguments and values. Neither type gives a complete picture on its own. Good Classical Studies answers show how archaeological and written sources complement one another: material remains can confirm, complicate or contradict literary accounts, while texts can give motives, chronology and voices that objects alone cannot supply. Learning to read both kinds of source critically is central to the Higher course and will also be the core of exam questions and the assignment.

## Archaeological evidence: what it can tell us and its limits
Archaeology supplies direct physical evidence of ancient life. Buildings and their layout reveal public and domestic functions; votive deposits and temples show religious practice; funerary gear and tomb types provide information on beliefs about death, status and gender; coins and pottery help with dating and patterns of trade; inscriptions fix names, offices, laws and formal commemoration. Understanding the context of discovery is crucial. A pot found in a domestic layer has a different evidential value from a votive offering in a temple or a hoard buried during conflict. Dating methods range from relative techniques such as stratigraphy and typology to absolute methods such as radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology; coins and dated inscriptions are often the most useful chronological anchors for historians of Greece and Rome.

Archaeology also has systematic biases and silences. Organic materials decay, so textiles and wooden objects are under-represented unless preserved by special environments. The archaeological record tends to privilege durable objects and monumental architecture, often leaving the lives of the poor or marginalised obscure. Recovery and interpretation depend on the decisions of excavators and later curators, so provenance, recording standards and subsequent re-use of material must always be considered. When using archaeological evidence in an answer, describe what the object can tell you about the specific question, point out what it cannot tell you, and consider whether later disturbance or selective survival affects its usefulness.

## Written evidence: authorship, genre and purpose
Written sources are rich in information but must be read as crafted texts with intended audiences and rhetorical aims. Historians such as Thucydides and Tacitus write to explain causes and lessons, often shaped by elite concerns. Orators and political pamphlets are designed to persuade. Drama and poetry can reveal contemporary values and tensions but are literary constructions rather than straightforward reportage. Inscriptions and official documents are often closer to administrative fact, but even official texts have purposes: laws shape behaviour, honorific inscriptions promote particular individuals, and epitaphs frame lives selectively.

Assessing a written source begins with authorship and date: who wrote it, when, for whom, and under what circumstances? Consider the genre and motive: is the author praising, accusing, entertaining or instructing? Look for internal clues to bias—selective facts, rhetorical devices, silences about certain groups—and for external corroboration from other writers or from material remains. Understanding the social and political position of an author helps explain perspective: an Athenian elite writing about democracy will not represent the views of metics, women or enslaved people. Good answers explain what a source can reliably tell us and what it cannot, and they place the source in its literary and historical context.

## Systematic interpretation: provenance, content, reliability and relevance
A structured method makes source evaluation manageable under timed conditions. Begin by establishing provenance and date: where was the source found or preserved, and how secure is its dating? Summarise content succinctly and identify the specific ways it relates to the question. Assess reliability by considering motive, audience, genre and contemporary context; ask whether the author or maker had incentives to exaggerate, silence or mislead. Discuss the scope of the source: does it speak broadly about institutions and beliefs, or narrowly about one individual or event? Finally, evaluate relevance: how directly does the source bear on the specific enquiry posed by the question? Conclude with a judgement of usefulness that balances the source’s strengths and weaknesses and indicates what complementary evidence would strengthen or challenge its testimony.

Applying this technique to pairs or groups of sources requires careful comparison. Note agreements and discrepancies and consider whether divergences arise from different vantage points, from different times, or from differing motives. Where sources contradict, explain which is more plausible and why, referring to internal consistency, corroboration and archaeological context. Where sources are silent, recognise the significance of absence: silence can be informative if you justify why you would have expected comment and why it is missing.

## Bias, representation and silences: reading between the lines
Ancient evidence is filtered through social hierarchies and survival patterns. Written sources are overwhelmingly produced by elite, literate men; their concerns often reflect property, political power and male experience. Archaeological assemblages are shaped by preservation and recovery practices that favour stone, metal and fired clay. Recognising these filters is essential to responsible interpretation. Avoid assuming that what is recorded represents the entire society. For example, official decrees tell us how authorities wanted to be seen, but not necessarily how ordinary people practised religion in private. Tomb inscriptions can highlight status and values preferred in death rather than everyday life. A robust answer acknowledges this partiality and uses a range of evidence to redress bias: literary texts, material culture, inscriptions and legal documents together give a more rounded picture than any single source.

Equally important is awareness of later transmission. Many Greek and Roman texts survive through medieval manuscript copies, with potential scribal errors or editorial changes. Archaeological finds may have been altered after excavation or miscatalogued. When possible, note these transmission issues because they affect how confidently we can use a source.

## Combining archaeological and written evidence: synthesis and case studies
The most powerful responses synthesize material and literary evidence to build a persuasive argument. Archaeology can confirm the existence of institutions mentioned in texts, illuminate their physical setting, or challenge textual claims about scale or uniformity. For instance, epigraphic tribute lists and harbour installations provide tangible support for discussions of Athenian imperial power beyond what literary rhetoric alone conveys. Conversely, texts supply names, dates and motives that material culture rarely records: laws, magistracies and speeches often survive only in writing. When sources disagree, analyse why: perhaps a historian writing after the fact reshaped events to make a moral point, while archaeological continuity shows a more pragmatic, slower change.

Use specific examples in classwork and revision to practise synthesis. For a question on religion compare temple architecture and votive deposits with dramatic and epigraphic evidence for civic festivals. For a question on slavery combine legal sources and literary attitudes with household archaeology and manumission inscriptions to assess daily realities and official ideology. Show how each type of source contributes distinct but complementary evidence and make reasoned judgements about the overall picture.

## The assignment and source use in research
When preparing the Higher assignment, source awareness matters throughout the research and production stages. During the research stage you may consult any materials, but you must record your sources on the Classical Studies resource sheet and be ready to defend their selection. The production stage, timed and supervised, permits only the single-sided 250-word resource sheet to be used, so your sheet must distil the most crucial evidence and references. Teachers may give reasonable guidance on topic selection and research techniques but not supply specific resources or draft answers. Your report should demonstrate careful evaluation of evidence, acknowledge limitations, compare classical and modern worlds where required, and reach a clear, justified conclusion. Remember that failing to submit a resource sheet incurs a penalty, so prepare and submit it diligently.

## Exam technique
Exam success blends knowledge with disciplined source-handling. Start every source question by explicitly linking the source to the question: identify form, authorship and date in one sentence, then summarise what it claims that matters to the enquiry. For "evaluate the usefulness" tasks, structure your answer by assessing provenance, content and purpose, then weigh strengths against limitations and finish with a judgement about how useful the source is for the specific question—usefulness varies by the enquiry posed. For "How fully do sources A, B and C..." compare each source’s coverage of the issue, point out what each source reveals and what it omits, assess contradictions and corroborations, and conclude on the overall extent to which the set answers the question while indicating what further evidence you would need. For longer "to what extent" or 12–20 mark questions, present a clear thesis, marshal evidence from sources and wider knowledge, evaluate counter-arguments, and finish with a balanced conclusion that reflects the evidence’s complexity.

Time management is vital. Read the paper carefully, choose questions where you can deploy strong source knowledge, and plan briefly before writing. Use short, focused paragraphs: make a claim, support with evidence, evaluate the source or evidence, and tie it back to the question. When comparing a modern quote with a classical idea, be alert to differences in perspective, anachronism and the modern author’s purpose; explain similarities and differences and assess whether the modern view fairly reflects ancient attitudes.

Finally, practise applying the interpretation checklist under timed conditions: establish provenance and date, summarise content, assess purpose and audience, consider reliability and transmission, discuss strengths and limitations, and bring in corroborative archaeological or textual evidence. Rehearse writing concise conclusions that answer the specific question rather than offering general statements. Clear structure, precise use of sources and critical evaluation are what turn knowledge into top marks.
