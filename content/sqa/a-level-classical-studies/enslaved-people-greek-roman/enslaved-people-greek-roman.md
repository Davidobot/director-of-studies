# Enslaved people in Greek and Roman societies (A-level Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: slavery and enslavement as institutions
Enslavement was a pervasive institution in both classical Greece and Rome, integral to economy, household life and public administration. In both societies enslaved people were legally regarded as property, yet their day-to-day experiences, roles and pathways to freedom varied considerably with time, place and social context. In fifth‑century BC Athens and in the Roman world of the first century BC and first century AD the use of enslaved labour allowed citizens to devote time to public life, culture and politics, while simultaneously shaping social hierarchies, legal practices and economic systems. Understanding enslavement therefore requires attention to legal status and ideology, practical work roles, mechanisms of enslavement and manumission, and the wider cultural and economic impacts on Greek and Roman societies.

## Terms, sources and attitudes
Modern scholarship prefers the phrase “enslaved people” to avoid implying passivity and to emphasise human agency. Ancient attitudes, however, ranged from acceptance to justification and occasional critique. Philosophers such as Aristotle famously argued for the idea of “natural slavery,” a rationalisation used to justify ownership of people deemed by him to lack deliberative capacity. Literary sources present a mixed picture: drama and comedy often give enslaved characters vivid personalities and sometimes moral voice, while historians and orators record the practical realities of capture, trade and control. Archaeological evidence — inscriptions, papyri, household objects and the remains of mines and estates — complements literary testimony by illuminating everyday labour, conditions of work and patterns of ownership. When reading ancient sources it is important to consider the author’s purpose and position: an Athenian citizen’s account of enslaved people will reflect civic assumptions; a Roman senator’s view will be shaped by elite economics and politics.

## How people became enslaved
There were several principal routes into enslavement in the classical world. War capture was a major source: defeated populations and prisoners were often taken and sold. Piracy and slave trading linked the Mediterranean and beyond, bringing people of diverse origins into markets. Debt, punishment for crimes and exposure of unwanted children could also result in enslavement. In Rome, the expansion of the Republic and later the Empire produced large numbers of captives from campaigns in the eastern and western Mediterranean, dramatically increasing the availability of enslaved labour in the late Republic. In Athens, wars of the fifth century provided captives, while trade through markets delivered skilled and unskilled workers. Birth into an enslaved household created a second generation of enslaved people, reproducing the institution across generations.

## Types of work and daily roles
Enslaved people filled a wide range of occupations, from the physically brutal to skilled and influential tasks. In both Greece and Rome, domestic service was common: household attendants, cooks, nurses and tutors in elite homes performed intimate work that made elite lifestyles possible. Urban enslaved labour included artisans, craftsmen, shopkeepers and clerks. In Athens, public enslaved people worked for the city in roles such as clerks, prison attendants and the Scythian archers who performed policing functions. In Rome, enslaved people were integral to large agricultural estates (latifundia), where work could be harsh and sometimes lethal, and to the mines and quarries, which were notorious for terrible conditions. The Roman economy, especially in the late Republic and early Empire, depended heavily on enslaved labour on a scale often larger than in classical Greece. Enslaved people could also be employed as professional cooks, doctors, accountants and even managers; skilled enslaved workers might earn money independently and improve their chances of manumission. Some were trained to fight as gladiators or row in galleys — roles that could bring infamy or, rarely, fame.

## Legal status, treatment and manumission
Legally, enslaved people were part of the owner’s property, lacking independent legal personhood. Owners had wide powers, including the ability to punish, though cultural norms, economic incentives and local laws placed some limits on abuse. Treatment varied greatly: household enslaved people living in elite homes could have relative proximity to comfort and influence, while those in mines or on plantations often endured brutal regimes. Both Greek and Roman societies recognised procedures for freeing enslaved people. In Athens manumission might take ritual forms — for example, a sale to a god or the state — or be negotiated privately. In Rome manumission became increasingly common and institutionalised, producing a distinct class of freedpeople whose status was intermediate: freed individuals acquired legal freedom and often Roman citizenship, though obligations of patronage to former owners remained. The prevalence of manumission in Rome created a large class of freedmen and freedwomen whose economic and social roles were significant. Reactions to manumission also reveal underlying anxieties about social order and the boundaries of citizenship.

## Resistance and the social consequences of enslavement
Resistance ranged from daily acts of defiance and subtle sabotage to organised revolts. Individual runaway slaves, legal petitions, appeals and cultural resistance were routine. More dramatic were large rebellions, which highlighted the tensions inherent in systems dependent on enslaved labour. In the Roman world the most famous is the Spartacus uprising of 73–71 BC, a significant armed revolt that alarmed the Roman elite and exposed vulnerabilities in relying on large enslaved populations. Sicily experienced prolonged slave uprisings in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, demonstrating the potential for unrest on estates and in agricultural regions. In Athens overt rebellion was less prominent in the surviving record, but attitudes toward enslavement — expressed by philosophers and dramatists — show the social conflicts it produced. The presence of significant enslaved populations affected social structures: it permitted elites to pursue political life and leisure while also creating an underclass whose size and proximity to power could be a source of fear and repression.

## Comparative features: Athens versus Rome
Comparing fifth‑century BC Athens to the Roman world of the first centuries BC/AD reveals both continuities and contrasts. Both societies accepted enslavement as normal and necessary for economic and domestic life, and both relied on war, trade and reproduction as sources of enslaved people. Yet scale and social outcomes differed. Rome’s territorial expansion in the late Republic and early Empire brought a dramatic influx of captives, producing a larger enslaved population and fostering the development of large plantation agriculture and urban enterprises on a scale that Athens did not match. Manumission practiced more widely in Rome created a visible and politically significant freedman class that could accumulate wealth and influence; such mobility existed in Athens but to a lesser and differently regulated extent. In Athens enslaved labour was crucial to the functioning of a direct democracy, freeing citizens to attend the Assembly and juries; paradoxically, this participatory civic life rested on the unpaid labour of non‑citizens. Greek philosophical debate sometimes critiqued or defended enslavement as a natural order, while Roman legal and social innovations responded to practical pressures of scale, economy and integration of diverse peoples. Regional variations within the Roman world also produced different experiences of enslavement: urban Rome, Italian estates and provincial settings could all look very different in practice.

## Cultural representation and moral reflection
Enslaved people appear in literature, drama and philosophy, often in ways that reveal contemporary anxieties and moral questions. Greek tragedy and comedy give enslaved characters attitudinal range and occasionally moral authority, while historiographical and philosophical texts articulate rationalisations for enslavement or articulate sceptical perspectives on justice and humanity. Roman writers discuss enslaved people in practical, moralising and occasionally sympathetic terms; stories of loyal or outstanding enslaved individuals could be used to reflect on virtue, betrayal and social obligation. Religious practices sometimes included enslaved people as temple servants or ritual participants, showing their integration into civic and sacred life even as they remained socially subordinated. These cultural materials are invaluable for students because they provide insights into attitudes and lived realities, but they must be read alongside material evidence and with an eye for authorial bias and genre.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on enslaved people, be precise about the time and place you are addressing and use concrete examples to support your arguments. For questions that ask you to evaluate a source, consider the author, date, purpose and content, and assess what the source can and cannot tell you about enslaved life; comment on bias, intended audience and how the source’s purpose affects its reliability. For extended essays or “to what extent” prompts, structure your answer with a clear introduction that defines key terms, several analytical paragraphs each focused on a specific point or piece of evidence, and a conclusion that weighs the evidence and gives a balanced judgment. Always integrate both Greek and Roman material where the question requires comparison, making explicit contrasts in scale, legal practices and social consequences. Use specific case studies — for example, Spartan or Athenian practices, Laurion mines, the Laurion silver mines and public slaves in Athens, Roman latifundia, the Spartacus revolt, and known examples of manumission — to ground general points. When asked to compare a classical idea with a modern quote or context, draw parallels but also highlight differences in legal status, ideology and economy; explain why similarities or differences matter for your argument. Finally, manage your time so you can plan briefly, write a focused body of argument and leave a short concluding paragraph that synthesises your main points rather than introducing new material.
