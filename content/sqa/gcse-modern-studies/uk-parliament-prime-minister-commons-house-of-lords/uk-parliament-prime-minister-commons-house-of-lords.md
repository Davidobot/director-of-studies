# UK Parliament: Prime Minister, Commons and House of Lords (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What the UK Parliament is and why it matters
The UK Parliament is the supreme legislative body for the United Kingdom. It makes and changes laws on matters reserved to Westminster, approves public spending, and holds the government to account. Parliament sits at the centre of the UK’s democratic system, but its role must be understood alongside devolved governments: the Scottish Parliament governs many domestic matters in Scotland while Westminster retains responsibility for reserved issues such as defence, foreign affairs and immigration. For Modern Studies, it is useful to see Parliament as a place where power is shared, checked and contested: the government proposes, Parliament debates and approves, and both the media and civil society influence the process. Understanding Parliament helps explain how decisions that affect everyday life are made and challenged.

## The Prime Minister: role, powers and limits
The Prime Minister (PM) is the head of the UK government and the leader of the political party (or coalition) that can command a majority in the House of Commons. The PM’s visible responsibilities include setting government policy, chairing Cabinet, appointing and dismissing ministers, representing the UK internationally, and answering Parliament — famously at Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs). Behind the scenes the PM uses party management, control of government business in the Commons, and patronage to achieve aims. The PM also has certain royal prerogative powers, exercised in the monarch’s name, such as appointing ministers, negotiating treaties and deploying the armed forces, though these powers are increasingly constrained by convention, parliamentary scrutiny and public debate.

Despite these powers, the PM is not all-powerful. The Cabinet, collective responsibility, party MPs and public opinion all limit decisions. A small or fragile Commons majority, a hung Parliament, or significant backbench opposition can force the PM to compromise or even resign. Recent constitutional changes are also relevant: the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which previously set fixed general election dates, was repealed in 2022 and the old system of dissolution by royal prerogative, on the advice of the Prime Minister, was restored; however, the political reality means a PM usually seeks parliamentary support before calling an election. Comparing the PM with Scotland’s First Minister helps students see how executive power is shared within the UK: the First Minister leads the Scottish Government and is accountable to the Scottish Parliament for devolved matters, while the Prime Minister leads the UK Government for reserved matters.

## The House of Commons: composition, functions and voting system
The House of Commons is the elected chamber of Parliament and the primary forum for making laws and controlling public finances. It is made up of MPs, each representing a constituency. The Commons selects the government: the party with the largest number of MPs normally forms the government and its leader becomes Prime Minister. The Commons approves taxation and spending, debates national policy, and holds ministers to account by asking questions, debating motions and using select committees.

Members of Parliament are elected using First Past the Post (FPTP), where the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins. FPTP tends to produce single-party majority governments and clear local representation, but it has well-known weaknesses: it can lead to a mismatch between the national share of votes and the share of seats, under-representation of smaller parties, and the election of MPs with less than majority support in a divided field. These features are often discussed in Modern Studies when evaluating how democratic the system is and whether electoral reform might make representation fairer.

Inside the Commons party discipline — the “whip” system — influences how MPs vote. Whips encourage MPs to vote with their party, and rebellion is uncommon but can be decisive in tight parliaments. MPs also represent local constituents through surgeries and casework, balancing national party policy with local concerns. Committees such as departmental select committees and the powerful Public Accounts Committee provide detailed scrutiny of government policy, budgets and administration; these committees call ministers and officials to give evidence and are an important practical check on executive power.

## The House of Lords: revising chamber, composition and limits
The House of Lords acts as a revising chamber that scrutinises and suggests improvements to legislation passed by the Commons. It is not elected; its members are appointed or inherit their position in limited numbers. Life peers form the majority and are appointed for their experience or expertise, while 92 hereditary peers remain following reform. The Lords also includes bishops from the Church of England. The House of Lords is therefore sometimes described as based on appointment rather than popular mandate, which raises questions about democratic legitimacy and representation.

Despite these criticisms, the Lords plays a valuable role in examining legislation in detail, proposing amendments, conducting specialist inquiries and offering expertise that may be less present in the Commons. Its power to block legislation is limited: it cannot permanently veto money bills and, through the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the Commons can bypass the Lords if a bill is rejected in successive sessions, effectively limiting most Lords delays to around a year. Conventions such as the Salisbury Convention also mean the Lords will not normally oppose measures promised in the governing party’s election manifesto. The composition and role of the Lords are frequent areas for assessment in Modern Studies, inviting students to weigh expertise and revision against questions of democratic accountability.

## How legislation and scrutiny work in practice
A bill can start in either House, though financial bills usually begin in the Commons. It goes through several stages: first reading (formal introduction), second reading (main debate on principles), committee stage (detailed line-by-line consideration), report stage (further amendment and debate), and third reading (final approval). If both Houses agree, the bill is sent for Royal Assent and becomes law. The Lords’ amendments return to the Commons and may be accepted, revised or rejected. The Commons is ultimately sovereign on financial matters and can override the Lords in most cases.

Scrutiny happens beyond stages of a bill. Question times, including PMQs, allow MPs to challenge ministers publicly. Select committees investigate and publish reports that often shape debate and can lead to policy change. The media, pressure groups and public petitions add additional layers of scrutiny and influence. Understanding this process helps students assess where power lies and how laws can be altered or blocked, giving concrete examples for evaluation questions in exams.

## Participation, influence and representation — including Scottish context
Individuals can participate in UK politics in many ways: voting in elections, joining political parties, contacting their MP, campaigning with pressure groups, or using media and social media to make their views heard. Pressure groups, trade unions and the press play significant roles in shaping public debate and influencing MPs and ministers. Trade unions historically influenced Labour policy, while pressure groups such as environmental or human rights organisations use petitions, demonstrations and targeted lobbying to press their case. The media frames issues for voters and can increase the salience of particular topics, but it can also introduce bias or distortion, so students should learn to evaluate sources carefully.

Representation is an important theme in Modern Studies. Women, ethnic minorities and other groups remain under-represented in Parliament compared with their share of the population. Attempts to improve representation include party measures such as all-women shortlists and wider ambitions to make politics more accessible. In the Scottish context, it is important to distinguish between reserved and devolved powers: MPs in Westminster legislate on reserved matters that affect the whole UK, while MSPs in Holyrood make decisions on devolved areas like education and health. This division can lead to tensions, especially when political parties are different in Holyrood and Westminster, and it is a useful area for evaluative questions about fairness and effectiveness in democracy.

## Teaching and learning: using examples and sources
When studying the UK Parliament, it helps to use recent, concrete examples to illustrate abstract ideas. Discuss specific government bills that were amended by the Lords, or key moments where the Commons held the government to account, such as major select committee inquiries. Use PMQs and committee hearings as sources to show how questioning works in practice. Encourage students to compare the skills of representation by examining how MPs balance constituency work with national responsibility, and to evaluate pressure group campaigns by looking at methods and outcomes. Teaching should also emphasise source evaluation: newspapers, government reports, think-tank analyses and statistics all have strengths and weaknesses. Practising the use of two different types of sources and linking research methods to findings prepares students well for the assignment and exam.

## Exam technique
To do well on Modern Studies questions about the Prime Minister, Commons and House of Lords, plan answers carefully and use evidence. For knowledge questions, give clear definitions and then expand points with specific examples from recent politics or historical events. When asked for “two ways” or “three reasons”, stick to the number required and develop each point with explanation rather than adding weak, brief extra points. For source-based and evaluative questions, compare and contrast information from at least two sources, comment on reliability and bias, and use evidence to support conclusions. In decision-making or choice questions, state clearly which option you choose, justify it with reasons and evidence, and explain why you rejected the alternative. For longer responses, structure your answer with short paragraphs that each make a clear point and end with a mini-conclusion. For the assignment, select a contemporary and well-defined topic, use at least two different kinds of sources, evaluate your research methods specifically, and ensure your Modern Studies Research Sheet records original evidence rather than copied material. Throughout, practise applying political concepts to real examples, check that you are answering the question asked, and make a clear, supported conclusion.
