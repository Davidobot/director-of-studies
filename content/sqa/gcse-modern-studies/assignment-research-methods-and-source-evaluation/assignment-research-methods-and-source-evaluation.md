# Modern Studies assignment skills: research methods and source evaluation (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview of the Modern Studies assignment
The Modern Studies assignment is your opportunity to research a contemporary political, social or international issue, to apply the investigative skills you have developed during the course, and to show how you can evaluate evidence and reach supported conclusions. It is worth 20 marks out of 100 for the course assessment and is completed in two stages: an open research stage, normally taking up to a notional eight hours, and a production stage completed under strict conditions in one hour. Your work must be your own and centres will check progress during the research stage; at the production stage you will be in direct sight of an assessor and will only have access to your Modern Studies Research Sheet. You must choose a topic that is clearly contemporary and clearly relevant to Modern Studies. The assignment requires you to use at least two different types of source, evaluate two research methods that you used, apply Modern Studies skills to your evidence, and reach a well-supported conclusion.

## Planning and choosing your topic
A successful assignment starts with a clear, manageable topic that fits the Modern Studies remit. Think narrowly enough to research in depth within the time allowed but broadly enough to allow genuine analysis and a conclusion supported by evidence. For example, instead of tackling “crime” in general, you might investigate “the causes and community impact of youth anti-social behaviour in my local council area” or examine “the effectiveness of local food banks in reducing food insecurity for families.” Early planning should set out aims or a hypothesis, identify the types of evidence you will need, and note potential sources. During planning, consider ethical and practical constraints: how you will obtain consent for any primary research, whether your proposed survey reaches a representative group, and whether data you need is publicly available. This stage is where you balance ambition with what can realistically be researched and written up in the allotted time.

## Research stage: methods and practicalities
The research stage is when you collect your evidence. You may use any resources during this stage, including interviews, surveys, official statistics, academic research, newspapers, charity reports and audiovisual material. Effective assignments tend to include a mix of primary and secondary sources: a short survey or interview provides direct, local insight while government statistics, academic studies or reports from reputable organisations add broader context and credibility. Practical research methods include online searches of official sites, Freedom of Information requests in limited cases, structured questionnaires, short telephone or email interviews, and using library or open-access reports. Record carefully the origin of each piece of evidence and capture dates so you can comment on currency. Keep detailed notes and drafts on your Research Sheet; remember the Research Sheet is limited to two single-sided A4 pages and must show evidence of your own research. Do not use the Research Sheet as a verbatim plan or a place to copy long extracts; examiners look for original engagement with sources.

## Evaluating sources and research methods
A core part of the assignment is evaluation. You must evaluate two methods you used for research and explain their strengths and weaknesses in the context of your project. When assessing a source, consider its authority, purpose, accuracy, currency and potential bias. For example, an official government statistic is likely to be robust for measuring trends over time but might not reveal lived experience; a local newspaper report can provide immediacy and local examples but may reflect editorial bias or selective reporting. A small in-class survey gives primary data directly relevant to your question but may suffer from sampling bias and limited generalisability. When evaluating methods, be specific: do not say “surveys can be biased” on their own. Instead explain how your survey’s sample size, question wording or method of distribution affected reliability and what you did to reduce problems, such as piloting questions or anonymising responses. Demonstrate awareness that sources serve different functions: statistical sources help identify scale and trend, qualitative interviews add depth and human perspective, and academic articles explain causation and competing theories. Show you can cross-check: if two sources disagree, explain possible reasons and say how this affects the confidence you place in each claim.

## Building findings and drawing conclusions
Your findings section should present the evidence you gathered and explain what it shows in relation to your aims or hypothesis. Use the findings section to make clear links between the evidence and the topic; do not slip into conclusions or repeat material verbatim from the Research Sheet. Effective findings combine description, evidence and an initial analytical comment that leads naturally towards your final conclusion. When drawing conclusions in the production stage, ensure they are well supported by different pieces of evidence and explain why some evidence is stronger than others. A top-grade assignment will show synthesis: it will weigh primary and secondary evidence, consider alternative explanations, and explain why one interpretation best fits the available material. Where appropriate, quantify findings: a change over time or percentage drawn from official data can be a powerful support to a written argument, but always explain what numbers mean in context. Your conclusion should answer your original question, state clearly whether your hypothesis was supported, and highlight any limits to how far your findings can be generalised.

## Academic integrity, supervision and reasonable assistance
Throughout the assignment you must take care to present work that is authentically yours. The research stage is conducted under some supervision and assessors will record interim progress checks; group work is possible in research, but each candidate must have clear, individual evidence. The production of evidence stage is tightly controlled: candidates must be in direct sight of the assessor, must not communicate with others, and may use only their Research Sheet. Reasonable assistance by teachers is allowed during preparation but does not extend to providing the topic, specifying particular resources, giving model answers, or providing detailed feedback on drafts. Be mindful that direct copying from sources or from your Research Sheet will not gain credit; paraphrase and summarise in your own words, and if you include direct quotations use them sparingly and clearly attributed. The Research Sheet itself is not marked but is required as part of your submission; failure to submit it will affect your ability to gain full marks. Keep electronic and handwritten source references clear so an external marker can see the provenance of your evidence.

## Practical examples of method evaluation and source critique
To make the abstract concrete, imagine a candidate investigating “whether local youth services reduce youth offending in my town.” They might use a local police statistics report (secondary quantitative), an online survey of young people in the town (primary quantitative), and interviews with staff at the youth service (primary qualitative). When evaluating the police report, the candidate should note that official crime statistics provide consistent, long-term figures useful for trends but may under-record certain offences or be affected by reporting practices. When evaluating the online survey, the candidate should identify sample bias if most respondents are friends from their school, explain how the phrasing of questions may have led to socially desirable answers, and reflect on response rates. When evaluating interviews, the candidate should show that staff offered direct insight into operations and challenges but might have an institutional interest in portraying the service positively. Good evaluation comments explain how these strengths and weaknesses affect the weight the candidate gives to each piece of evidence and how combining sources mitigates individual weaknesses.

## Exam technique
When preparing and sitting the production stage and when practising for source-based questions in the question paper, time management and structure are essential. In the production stage, use your hour to write clearly and directly: begin by restating your question or hypothesis, briefly summarise the key sources you will use, present your findings with explicit links to evidence, evaluate the two research methods you used with specific examples from your own work, and end with a conclusion that draws together the strongest evidence. In the question paper, follow the rubric closely: if a question asks for two reasons, give your best two reasons and develop them rather than writing many undeveloped points. For source evaluation questions, compare and contrast sources explicitly, use terminology such as reliability, validity, currency and bias, and always link back to the question. When you make a decision in an options question, state clearly which option you choose and why, and explain why you rejected the other option. Practise paraphrasing and summarising so you can use evidence without copying, and be ready to show analytical thinking by weighing evidence and considering counter-arguments. Finally, present your work neatly, signpost each section so the assessor can follow your argument, and proofread quickly for clarity and accuracy before submission.
