# Participation and influence: elections, media, pressure groups and unions (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Democracy, participation and elections in Scotland and the UK
Participation in a democracy means more than just voting on election day; it includes contacting representatives, joining campaigns, protesting, and using the media to influence opinion. In Scotland and the wider UK these opportunities sit alongside the formal institutions of democracy: parliaments and governments that make decisions about public life. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and transport, while the UK Parliament retains reserved powers including defence and foreign policy. Citizens have rights and responsibilities: the right to vote and to stand for election, and the responsibility to take informed part in democratic life.

Different elections attract different levels of participation. General elections to the UK Parliament typically see higher turnout than local or some devolved elections, though this can change depending on how competitive or salient the issues are. In Scotland the franchise for Scottish Parliament and local government elections includes 16 and 17 year olds, which changes the profile of participation in devolved contests; UK Parliamentary elections remain restricted to those aged 18 and over. Understanding these differences helps explain who participates, why they do so and how political decisions are shaped.

## Voting systems and representation
How votes are translated into seats has a major influence on representation. The UK Parliament is elected using First Past the Post, where the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins. This system tends to produce single-party governments and clear local representatives, but it can also lead to a mismatch between the share of votes a party receives and the number of seats it wins. Smaller parties and dispersed minorities often struggle to win seats under this system.

The Scottish Parliament uses the Additional Member System, combining constituency First Past the Post with regional party lists to produce a more proportional result. Voters have two votes: one for a constituency MSP and one for a regional list. The regional seats are used to balance out the disproportionality generated by constituency results. This system aims to combine local accountability with fairer overall representation, and it can lead to coalition or minority governments. Each system has strengths and weaknesses: First Past the Post is simple and stable, while mixed or proportional systems increase fairness and diversity of representation but may produce less decisive outcomes.

Representation is not only about proportionality; it is also about the presence of women, ethnic minorities and under-represented groups within political institutions. Parties, electoral rules and selection methods all affect who gets elected. Mechanisms such as all-women shortlists, candidate training, and party targets can improve diversity, while barriers such as socioeconomic costs, discrimination and incumbency effects can limit it.

## How elections are run and how campaigns work
Elections are high-stakes events that involve mobilisation, communication and resource management. Political parties and individual candidates run campaigns to persuade undecided voters, mobilise their supporters and present clear programmes. Traditional methods include doorstep canvassing, leafleting, local meetings and televised debates. Modern campaigning increasingly uses digital tools: social media advertising, targeted emails, and data analytics to focus resources where they can have most effect.

Campaign finance rules and spending limits exist to make contests fairer, and broadcasters are regulated to ensure impartiality at certain times. Parties publish manifestos outlining their promises, and local campaigning can involve community-specific issues to connect with voters’ day-to-day concerns. High-profile campaigns in Scotland and across the UK show how clear messaging, charismatic leadership and effective organisation can shape outcomes. Equally, poor campaign management, scandals or misinformation can severely damage a campaign’s chances.

Elections also provide a stage for wider democratic engagement. Debates about voting age, compulsory voting, ease of registration and postal or online voting systems all shape participation. Voter registration drives, youth engagement programmes and civic education aim to increase turnout and deepen public understanding of how political choices affect everyday life.

## The media: informing, scrutinising and shaping opinion
The media plays a central role in modern democracies by informing the public, scrutinising power and shaping the political agenda. Broadcast outlets such as television and radio are subject to regulation that requires impartiality in news and political coverage at key times, while newspapers, online news sites, and social media are less tightly regulated. This creates a mixed media environment in which traditional news organisations provide in-depth reporting and televised debates, while social platforms enable rapid spread of claims and grassroots mobilisation.

Media influence operates in several ways. Agenda-setting describes how media can highlight particular issues as important, prompting public debate and political action. Framing refers to the way stories are told, which affects how people interpret events. Investigative journalism can expose wrongdoing and lead to policy change, while biased or selective reporting can distort public understanding. The rise of social media introduced new challenges: rapid spread of misinformation, targeted political advertising, and the creation of filter bubbles where users see content that confirms their views.

Regulation, media literacy and journalistic standards are key parts of ensuring healthy media influence. Citizens who can evaluate sources critically are better equipped to distinguish between reliable information and manipulation. Political campaigns and pressure groups seek media coverage because public visibility often translates into political pressure; knowing how the media works helps explain why certain issues rise to prominence and how public opinion is formed.

## Pressure groups: routes to influence outside party politics
Pressure groups are organisations that seek to influence government decisions, policy and public opinion without standing for election themselves. They range from professional associations and trade bodies to grassroots campaign groups and charities. Some operate as insiders with regular access to decision-makers and a role in consultations, while others act as outsiders, using public campaigns, protests and media work to apply pressure.

Methods used by pressure groups include lobbying politicians and officials, producing research and briefing papers, organising public demonstrations, running petitions and legal challenges, and using social media campaigns to mobilise supporters. The effectiveness of a pressure group depends on a combination of factors: the size and commitment of its membership, the quality of its evidence and arguments, its public profile, the political context and the receptiveness of policymakers.

Examples in the Scottish and UK context include environmental organisations influencing climate and conservation policy, equality groups advancing legal protections and public awareness, and professional bodies offering expert advice on sectoral reforms. Pressure groups can sometimes achieve quick, high-profile wins by shaping public debate or long-term change through sustained engagement with institutions. Evaluating their influence requires looking beyond headline successes to measure whether their campaigns change policy, public attitudes or the decisions of key actors.

## Trade unions and collective action: workers’ voice in politics
Trade unions are organisations that represent workers’ interests in negotiations with employers and in public policy debates. Historically powerful in many industries, unions engage in collective bargaining, represent members in disputes, and use industrial action such as strikes to press for better pay or conditions. They also play a role in politics by campaigning for labour-friendly policies and by supporting sympathetic parties.

In Scotland the Scottish Trades Union Congress provides coordination and a collective voice for many unions; across the UK unions have shaped debates on wages, workplace safety and public sector provision. Membership levels have shifted over time, with declines in some private-sector industries offset by stronger union presence in public services such as health and education. Unions’ influence comes from their organisational capacity, ability to mobilise members, expertise in labour issues and, at times, electoral resources.

Strikes and industrial action can have significant political impacts by drawing attention to disputes and forcing government or employers to negotiate. At the same time, public reactions to strikes, legal limits on action, and changes in labour law determine how effective unions can be. Unions also use non-industrial methods of influence, such as political lobbying, research production, and coalition-building with other civil society groups.

## Barriers to participation and efforts to increase representation
Not everyone participates equally in politics. Barriers include socioeconomic factors, lack of time or interest, perceived complexity of politics, feelings of alienation, and logistical obstacles such as registration difficulties. Some groups—young people, lower-income citizens, some ethnic minority communities, and those with disabilities—are less likely to vote or engage with formal political processes. Structural issues such as the cost of standing for office, childcare responsibilities, and informal networks of power also limit who becomes a representative.

Efforts to increase participation include civic education, voter registration campaigns, accessible voting arrangements, and reforms to candidate selection processes to promote diversity. Parties and civil society organisations run programmes aimed at engaging under-represented groups, and changes to voting systems can alter incentives for parties to recruit diverse candidates. Public accountability, transparent selection processes and visible role models in political life all help reduce barriers. Ultimately, a healthy democracy depends on ongoing work to ensure that a wide range of voices can be heard and affect decisions.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on participation and influence, start by making clear definitions and setting the context. If a question asks about elections, explain whether you mean Scottish or UK elections and briefly note the relevant voting system or legal difference, such as the Scottish Parliament’s Additional Member System versus the UK’s First Past the Post. In knowledge questions, use specific, contemporary examples to illustrate your points; named examples make answers more convincing and show real-world understanding.

For evaluation and source-based questions, balance is essential. Make clear, developed points and follow them with explanation and evidence. If asked to consider the influence of a pressure group or union, assess the factors that help or limit influence: membership, resources, access, public support and political context. Where the question asks you to choose an option or make a decision, explicitly state your choice at the start of the answer and explain why the chosen option is stronger than the alternative by referring to evidence and weighing comparative strengths.

In source questions, use the sources to support and challenge the claim in the question. Show how each source provides evidence and then bring in your own knowledge to add depth or counterpoints. For longer answers, plan a brief structure in your head or jot down a few notes: an introduction defining terms, two or three developed paragraphs with examples and analysis, and a concise conclusion that directly answers the question.

Manage your time according to marks available, and make sure you address all parts of a multi-part question. For the assignment component, choose a clear, contemporary Modern Studies issue and research it using at least two different types of source. Use the research sheet to record your findings, methods and reflections, but do not copy it into your final submission. Ensure the production of evidence is your own work and that conclusions are supported by the evidence you gathered. Practise writing concise, well-supported arguments under timed conditions to build the skills required for both the question paper and the assignment.
