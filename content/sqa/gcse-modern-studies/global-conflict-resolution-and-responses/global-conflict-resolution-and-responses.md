# Global issues and conflict resolution: causes, consequences and responses (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Understanding global issues and conflicts
Global issues and regional or international conflicts are problems that cross borders and affect many countries, communities and people. They can be sudden, such as the outbreak of war, or long‑running, such as entrenched economic inequality or a refugee crisis. In Modern Studies it helps to think of a global issue in three linked parts: the causes that produce the problem, the consequences that follow for people and states, and the responses by governments, international organisations and civil society. Contemporary examples include interstate conflict, civil wars with international involvement, terrorism, humanitarian crises driven by persecution or natural disaster, and transnational economic problems such as debt or the effects of a global recession. Understanding how these parts relate makes it easier to describe, explain and evaluate different attempts at resolution.

## Causes: political, social and economic drivers
Conflicts and global problems usually emerge from a mix of political, social and economic causes rather than a single trigger. Political causes include struggles over territory, competing visions of state power, contested leadership and weak or collapsing governance. The expansion of external alliances or perceived threats from international organisations can also feed insecurity and confrontation. Social causes often involve identity politics, ethnic or religious tension, discrimination and exclusion; these can harden into violence when groups feel their basic rights are denied. Economic causes range from inequality and poverty to competition for resources, economic collapse and unemployment. Environmental pressures, such as drought and climate change, can intensify resource scarcity and prompt population movements that create local or regional tensions. In many conflicts these causes interact: economic hardship can erode state legitimacy, elites may exploit social divisions for political gain, and weak institutions then fail to prevent escalation into violence.

## Consequences: human, regional and global effects
The human cost of conflicts and global crises is often the most visible and urgent consequence. Large numbers of civilians can be killed or injured, and millions may be displaced internally or forced to seek refuge in other countries. Displacement creates humanitarian emergencies with immediate needs for shelter, food, water and healthcare, and long‑term challenges such as education for children and social integration. At the regional level conflicts can destabilise neighbouring states, spread arms and fighters across borders, and create economic disruption through interrupted trade and investment. Globally, major conflicts can affect energy supplies, food prices and migration flows, and can test international legal norms about sovereignty, human rights and the use of force. Economies suffer both directly through destruction and indirectly through investor confidence, leading to long periods of slow recovery. Social consequences include trauma, breakdown of community relations and difficulties in rebuilding trust between divided groups, all of which complicate post‑conflict reconstruction.

## Responses: state action, international organisations and civil society
Responses to global issues come from a variety of actors with different aims and methods. States may respond unilaterally or in coalition, using diplomacy, economic tools such as sanctions, or military force. International organisations play a central role in coordination and legitimacy; the United Nations can authorise peacekeeping or humanitarian missions, while regional bodies such as the European Union, African Union or NATO may lead political mediation, sanctions or military interventions depending on their remit and membership. Financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can provide emergency lending or longer‑term economic support when crises have severe financial effects. Non‑governmental organisations and charities deliver front‑line humanitarian aid and advocate for human rights, often filling gaps left by state action. Media and public opinion also shape responses by focusing attention on particular crises, pressuring governments to act or to change policy priorities. Each actor faces constraints: states weigh national interest and public support; international organisations must manage member state divisions and limited resources; aid agencies must navigate access and security to deliver assistance.

## Military and non‑military approaches to resolution
Attempts to resolve conflicts take many forms and can be roughly separated into military and non‑military approaches, though in practice they often overlap. Military responses seek to change facts on the ground, protect civilians through force, deter further aggression, or degrade armed groups. Peacekeeping operations authorised by the UN are designed to stabilise ceasefires and create space for political solutions, while military coalitions may pursue regime change or counter‑terrorism objectives. Non‑military approaches include diplomatic negotiation, economic sanctions aimed at pressuring leaders, targeted development aid to address root causes, humanitarian relief to reduce suffering, and transitional justice measures such as tribunals and truth commissions to address crimes and promote reconciliation. Community‑level peacebuilding work, including disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants, institution building and support for rule of law, seeks to address the longer‑term conditions for stable peace. The effectiveness of any approach depends on timing, design and political will; military solutions without political settlement tend to be temporary, while purely diplomatic measures without leverage may fail to stop violence.

## Conflict resolution and peacebuilding in practice
Successful conflict resolution typically combines immediate measures to reduce violence with longer‑term political and social work to prevent recurrence. Negotiations and peace agreements are central, but they must be inclusive to address the concerns of key groups and often require guarantees, monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. Peacekeeping forces can provide security while mediators work, but their mandate, troop strength and rules of engagement determine what they can achieve. Economic recovery and social reconciliation are essential for durable peace: rebuilding infrastructure, restoring services, creating jobs and reforming institutions all reduce the chances that violence will return. Transitional justice, including trials, reparations and truth‑telling, plays a role in recognising victims and establishing historical records, though it must be balanced with practical needs for reconciliation. External actors should support national ownership of peace processes; imposed solutions or ones that ignore local dynamics frequently fail. Finally, prevention is as important as resolution: early international engagement, conflict‑sensitive development and addressing grievances before they turn violent are cost‑effective ways to reduce future crises.

## Case studies that illustrate causes, consequences and responses
Several recent cases help to make these ideas concrete. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia can be understood through political and security causes, including disputes over territory and differing views on NATO’s role in Eastern Europe. The consequences have included large numbers of civilian casualties, millions of refugees and significant global economic effects through disruptions to energy and food supplies. Responses combined military support to Ukraine from partner states, wide economic sanctions on Russia, diplomatic isolation and humanitarian assistance. The outcomes show both the power and limits of international action: sanctions and aid have had major impact, but prolonged conflict and humanitarian need remain.

The Syrian civil war, which began in 2011, illustrates how initial political protests can escalate into a complex, multi‑layered conflict involving external states and non‑state armed groups. Economic decline, authoritarian governance and sectarian tensions contributed to escalation, while consequences included massive displacement, regional refugee crises and the temporary rise of extremist groups. Responses were divided; the UN repeatedly tried to mediate, but Security Council vetoes limited action, and a combination of foreign military interventions, humanitarian relief by NGOs and regional diplomacy produced mixed results. Reconstruction and reconciliation remain difficult because of continuing political fragmentation.

A humanitarian example is the persecution and displacement of the Rohingya from Myanmar to Bangladesh. Political and social exclusion combined with violent state actions created a refugee emergency. Responses were primarily humanitarian, led by international agencies and NGOs, with limited international political pressure and growing calls for legal accountability. The case demonstrates the limits of humanitarian response when political solutions are absent and the importance of legal mechanisms in addressing alleged crimes.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on global issues and conflict resolution, start by identifying clearly whether the question asks about causes, consequences or responses—and make sure your answer matches the command word. Use a contemporary example to illustrate your points, naming the country or conflict and briefly explaining how it links to the point you make. For short knowledge questions, follow any rubric such as ‘two ways’ or ‘maximum of three reasons’ and focus on developing the best two or three points rather than listing many brief items. For higher‑mark explanation or evaluation questions, develop each point with analysis: explain how a cause led to a consequence, or how a particular response produced a given outcome, and where possible draw on evidence from different parts of your chosen case. In source‑based questions, compare what sources show by referring to specific details and consider reliability, bias and purpose to support or challenge the conclusions you draw. When asked to make a decision or recommend a response, state your choice clearly, justify it with linked reasons and then explain why alternative options are less convincing. For the assignment, choose a contemporary, focused issue; use at least two different types of sources and record your research on the permitted two sides of A4 research sheet, making sure the sheet shows how your evidence supports your findings. Remember the controlled one‑hour production stage: plan your answer, use evidence selectively, evaluate your sources and reach a clear, supported conclusion. Practise writing full explanations and short evaluative paragraphs under timed conditions so you can balance detail with clarity in the exam.
