# Interpreting sources and statistics: evidence, graphs and conclusions (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Why interpreting sources and statistics matters

Interpreting sources and statistics is at the heart of Modern Studies. Whether you are examining voter turnout, trends in crime, or international aid flows, the ability to read evidence carefully and to draw justified conclusions is what separates opinion from reasoned argument. In this course you will be asked to support or oppose views using sources, to make decisions based on given evidence, and to draw conclusions that are backed by more than one piece of information. Developing these skills helps you take part in democratic life, understand public debates, and complete the assignment where you research a contemporary issue and justify your conclusions.

## Types of sources and how to judge them

Sources come in many forms: newspaper articles, official statistics, research reports, political speeches, press releases, graphs and photographs. Each type has a different purpose and a different level of reliability. Official statistics from government departments or national agencies are usually produced with consistent methods, but they can still be limited by what is measured, by reporting delays, or by how definitions change over time. Academic research and think‑tank reports often explain methods and limitations, which makes them useful for critical work, but you must note the authors’ perspective. Media sources are useful for contemporary context and examples, yet they can be selective and may emphasise dramatic stories. When you evaluate a source in an answer, explain who produced it, why it was produced, and what effect that purpose might have on the information it contains. Cross‑checking across different types of sources strengthens your approach: if a claim appears in an official report and is also reflected in independent academic research, it is more credible than a claim found in a single opinion piece.

## Reading statistics and graphs accurately

Graphs and charts are a compact way to present numerical information, but they can be misread if you do not attend to details. Always begin by reading the title, the labels on the axes, and any notes about the units of measurement. A line graph that shows “index 2010 = 100” tells a different story from one showing raw numbers. Identify the time period covered and whether the graph shows absolute figures or percentages. When you describe a trend, be precise: say whether there is a steady increase, a sharp fall, a peak and then a drop, or seasonal variation. Comparisons should mention both the dimension compared and the size of the difference; saying “A is higher than B” is less strong than “A rose by 20 percentage points while B rose by 3 percentage points over the same period.” Be wary of misleading scales: a truncated vertical axis can exaggerate small changes, and non‑linear scales need careful interpretation. Pay attention to sample size and sampling methods when statistics come from polls or surveys, since small or unrepresentative samples limit how far you can generalise. Lastly, remember that correlation shown on a graph does not prove causation. Two trends moving together might be related, but you must look for plausible cause‑and‑effect explanations and additional evidence before claiming one caused the other.

## Using evidence to support and oppose a view

When a question asks you to support or oppose a view, your answer should present a clear position and then use evidence to build a balanced argument. Start by stating your position in one short sentence so the marker knows your stance. Then bring in specific pieces of evidence: facts from an official statistic, a quotation from a source, or a clear finding from an academic study. Explain how each piece of evidence supports your point—do not assume the connection is obvious. Where appropriate, use more than one source to back the same claim; this demonstrates you are not relying on a single perspective. Equally important is presenting the strongest counter‑argument. A strong response acknowledges weaknesses in the evidence you have used and considers alternative explanations. For example, if you argue that rising unemployment caused an increase in property crime, you should note other possible factors such as changes in policing, reporting rates, or economic policy. Concluding this kind of question involves weighing the evidence: say which side you find more convincing and why, referring back to the strongest evidence you have presented.

## Drawing conclusions and making decisions

Drawing a conclusion means moving beyond description to make a judgement based on evidence. A good conclusion is not a guess; it is a reasoned assessment that summarises the most important findings and explains their significance. To reach such a conclusion, link evidence directly to the claim you are making and use qualifying language where necessary. For instance, say “the evidence suggests” or “on balance, the data indicate” rather than absolute statements when the data are not definitive. When a question asks you to make a decision between two options, be explicit about which option you choose and why. Explain why the alternative was rejected by referring to its weaker evidence or practical drawbacks. In Modern Studies you will often need to consider both short‑term and long‑term consequences: a government policy may reduce crime in the short term but have social costs in the long term. A robust conclusion recognises such trade‑offs and demonstrates an ability to weigh immediate results against broader effects.

## The assignment and good research practice

The assignment is your chance to apply source‑handling and research skills to a contemporary issue. Choose a topic that is current, manageable in scope, and allows you to find at least two different types of sources. During the research stage record where your information comes from and keep notes that identify dates, authorship and any methodological detail. The research sheet is limited, so be selective: include the key pieces of evidence, brief notes on methods used, and clear links between your findings and the conclusion you will write in the controlled task. When evaluating your research methods, be specific about strengths and weaknesses. For example, if you conducted a small survey, note its usefulness for local insight but its limited representativeness. If you used national statistics, explain their reliability but also any gaps or definitional changes that affect interpretation. Plagiarism and copying are penalised; the work you submit must be your own and your research sheet should be used to present evidence rather than a verbatim script. During the production stage you will not have access to the same range of materials, so your research should prepare you to explain and justify your conclusions from memory and from the evidence recorded on your research sheet.

## Exam technique

In the exam, time management and clarity of expression are as important as content. Start questions by making the required stance or by underlining the conclusion you will develop; this gives structure to your answer and helps the examiner follow your reasoning. For knowledge questions, use specific contemporary examples where appropriate: mention a recent election result when discussing voting systems, or refer to a named government policy when explaining responses to social inequality. For source‑based questions, always refer directly to the information in the source and explain how it supports or undermines the point you are making. When analysing graphs, quote key figures or changes so your description is precise. Avoid writing more points than the rubric allows; if a question asks for two reasons, pick the best two and expand them rather than listing many undeveloped points. In longer evaluative responses, organise your answer into short paragraphs that each make a clear claim, provide evidence, and analyse how the evidence matters. Use comparative language when required and, in decision questions, explicitly state which option you choose and why you rejected the other. Finally, leave a few minutes to check your answers for clarity and to ensure you have addressed every part of the question. A well‑structured, evidence‑based response that recognises limitations and counter‑evidence will score highly.
