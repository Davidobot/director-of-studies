# Studying a world power: political system, influence and socio‑economic issues (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Course and task overview
When you study a world power for National 5 Modern Studies you are asked to treat a single country in depth. The topic requires you to describe that country’s political system, explain how it influences other states, and investigate key social and economic problems within the country. In the course assessment you will answer one international question in the question paper (worth 80 marks of the course paper) and you will also undertake an assignment (worth 20 marks) in which you research a contemporary Modern Studies issue of your own choice. The assignment has a research stage, typically taking up to eight hours, and a production stage that must be completed in one hour under strict supervision. Your revision should therefore balance factual knowledge about a chosen country with skills in using and evaluating evidence, analysing causes and consequences, and making supported judgements.

## Choosing and focusing your study
Picking the right country and narrowing your focus are crucial. The specification permits study of a major world power drawn from the G7 (excluding the UK) or from Brazil, China, India, Russia or South Africa. Once you have chosen a country, aim to give a clear account of its political institutions and how decisions are made, and then study at least three socio‑economic issues, ensuring you cover at least one social issue and one economic issue. Good choices are those you can support with contemporary, reliable evidence: for example, choosing the United States allows discussion of federalism, presidential power and how US economic policy affects global markets, while choosing China allows study of one‑party rule, centralised planning and rapid industrialisation alongside issues such as internal migration and air pollution. Make sure you can find a mixture of source types for your assignment and for source‑based exam questions: government reports, reputable news analysis, academic summaries and international statistics all strengthen answers.

## Political system: what to explain and how to compare
A successful study begins with a clear description of the political system and how power is distributed. Explain the system’s core features: whether it is presidential or parliamentary, unitary or federal, single‑party or multi‑party, and how representation works. Describe key political institutions and the roles of leaders and legislatures: who makes laws, who sets policy, and how checks and balances operate in practice. For example, when studying the United States you should explain separation of powers between the President, Congress and the Supreme Court, and the role of federal and state governments. When studying China you should describe the leading role of the Communist Party, the National People’s Congress as a legislative body, and the relationship between party and state. Include participation and representation: how citizens vote, the voting system in use, turnout patterns and the representation of women and minority groups. A concise comparison between the formal rules and how politics works in reality is especially helpful; systems often differ between what the constitution says and how power operates day to day, and noting that difference is a strong analytical move.

## Influence on other countries: political, economic, military and soft power
World powers shape international affairs in many ways and your study must show the range of influence. Political influence comes through diplomacy, alliances and leadership in international organisations. Economic influence operates through trade relationships, investment, currency power and access to markets. Military influence can be visible through bases, deployments, arms sales and alliance commitments. Cultural influence, or soft power, is exercised by media, education, language and global brands. Use concrete examples to illustrate each type of power. The United States, for instance, exerts influence through NATO and bilateral alliances, the global reach of the dollar, its military bases and Hollywood culture. China influences other countries using trade, the Belt and Road Initiative, development financing and diplomatic outreach. When evaluating influence, show how actions create both cooperation and tension: trade links can bring prosperity but also dependency; military alliances can deter aggression but provoke rivalry. Assessing both short‑term effects and longer‑term trends will strengthen your answers.

## Socio‑economic issues within a world power
Your study must cover at least three internal issues, including at least one social and one economic issue, and explain causes, consequences and responses. Economic issues might include employment levels, wage inequality, regional disparities and economic policy. Social issues might include health services, education provision, internal migration, social inequality and crime. For each issue, explain the underlying causes—structural factors, policy choices, demographic trends or external shocks—and the consequences for individuals, families and society as a whole. For example, in the United States you could examine rising income inequality, the causes linked to labour market changes and tax policy, and consequences such as reduced social mobility and political polarisation. In China you could analyse internal migration from rural to urban areas, its causes in search of work, and consequences for housing, education and health services. Always link to specific evidence: statistics on unemployment, poverty rates, public expenditure on health or education, or documented increases in crime provide a factual backbone for your analysis.

## Evaluating effectiveness: government and other responses
A key part of the assessment is to judge how well governments, the private sector and voluntary organisations address problems. For each issue you study, identify the main responses and evaluate their success and limits. Consider the design of policies, their implementation, political constraints, budgetary trade‑offs and unintended effects. For example, when governments subsidise childcare to improve employment outcomes, weigh up evidence on access, cost, and whether the policy reaches the most disadvantaged. When analysing crime and punishment, compare the effectiveness of policing, courts and alternatives such as rehabilitation programmes. Internationally, consider how a world power’s foreign policy tools—trade sanctions, aid, diplomacy or military intervention—succeed or fail in achieving objectives. Use specific case studies and evidence to support judgements, and where possible contrast different viewpoints or data sources to show balanced evaluation.

## Preparing your assignment and using evidence effectively
The assignment is an opportunity to show research skills and critical judgement. Select a contemporary issue narrow enough to research within the time available and broad enough to allow reasoned conclusions. During the research stage collect at least two different types of source, for example an official report and independent academic commentary, and evaluate them explicitly in your assignment. Be precise about methods: if you carried out a survey or interview, explain how you sampled respondents and what limitations that introduces. The research sheet you submit must be your own work and is limited to two single‑sided A4 sheets; treat it as evidence of research rather than a script to copy from. In the production stage you will have one hour and only the research sheet, so organise your notes beforehand and practise writing a focused, analytical response within timed conditions. In the assignment you must explain the strengths and weaknesses of your sources, link research methods to findings, and reach a well‑supported conclusion that draws on more than one piece of evidence.

## Exam technique
To maximise marks in the question paper, read the rubric carefully and choose the option you know best. For knowledge and understanding questions always try to develop each point with a specific, contemporary example and show some analysis rather than mere description. When a question asks for “two ways” or “a maximum of three reasons” respond with the number requested and develop those points fully; extra material that goes beyond the required number will not earn additional marks. For source‑based questions compare and contrast evidence, and when drawing conclusions use material from at least two sources or two parts of a single source to support your judgement. For option or decision questions explicitly state which option you have chosen, clearly indicate whether you support or oppose the view, and explain why you rejected the other option. Time management is crucial: practise past paper questions under timed conditions, allocate time per question and leave a few minutes at the end to check your work. For the assignment, plan your research so that your evidence is varied and clearly referenced on your research sheet, use the sheet to present key dates, statistics and quotations you can then deploy in the timed production stage, and make sure your conclusions are specific, balanced and directly linked to the evidence you gathered. Remember that clear, well‑structured writing and accurate, contemporary examples are as important as factual knowledge in achieving higher grades.
