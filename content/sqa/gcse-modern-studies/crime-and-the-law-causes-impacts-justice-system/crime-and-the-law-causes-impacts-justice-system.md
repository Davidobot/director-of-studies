# Crime and the law: causes, impacts and the criminal justice system (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Understanding the nature and extent of crime
When studying crime it helps to begin by distinguishing different kinds of crime and by understanding how we measure them. Crime can be violent or non-violent, acquisitive (such as theft or burglary), public order related, drug-related or cyber-enabled, and it affects people and places in different ways. The two main sources used to estimate how much crime there is are police recorded crime and victim surveys. Police figures record incidents that come to the attention of law enforcement; they can rise or fall because of real changes in offending, changes in reporting behaviour or changes in recording practices. Victim surveys ask people directly about their experiences of crime and can reveal the “dark figure” of offences that were not reported to the police. For classroom examples, comparing a rise in recorded assault with a stable victim survey for the same period prompts questions about recording, policing priorities and public confidence.

## Causes and explanations of crime
Explaining why people commit crimes requires a multi‑factor approach. Social explanations point to poverty, unemployment, poor housing, low educational attainment and social exclusion as factors that increase the likelihood of offending for some people. Economic explanations focus on material need or the perceived rewards of crime, especially where legitimate opportunities are limited. Psychological and biological explanations explore individual factors such as personality, mental health, substance misuse and impulse control. Situational explanations consider opportunity: crimes of opportunity are more likely where targets are accessible and guardianship (for example, CCTV or secure locks) is weak. It is important to avoid simplistic cause-and-effect claims: not everyone who grows up in disadvantaged circumstances becomes an offender, and many offenders do so in response to a combination of immediate circumstances, longer-term influences and individual choices. Case studies such as youth offending linked to school exclusion or cycles of substance misuse in some communities help illustrate how different causes interact.

## Impacts of crime on individuals, families and communities
The effects of crime go far beyond legal statistics. Victims can suffer physical injury, trauma and long-lasting anxiety, and the emotional impact can include loss of trust, sleep disturbance and reduced participation in everyday life. Families of both victims and perpetrators may experience financial strain and stigma, and communities can be harmed through damaged local businesses, falling property values and a reduced sense of safety. Fear of crime can change people’s behaviour, limiting leisure activities and weakening community ties. At a wider level, crime carries direct and indirect economic costs for society: policing, court proceedings, victim support services and the running of prisons are significant public expenditures. Understanding impact therefore means looking at human stories as well as economic figures, and recognising unequal effects: some groups and neighbourhoods bear heavier burdens from certain types of crime.

## The criminal justice system in Scotland and the UK
The criminal justice system brings together police, prosecutors, courts and custodial and non-custodial sanctions. In Scotland, policing is delivered nationally by Police Scotland and children are often dealt with through the distinctive Children’s Hearing System, which focuses on welfare as well as accountability. The court structure in Scotland includes Justice of the Peace Courts, Sheriff Courts and the High Court of Justiciary, which is the supreme criminal court. In the rest of the UK magistrates’ courts and the Crown Court play the central roles in handling different types of offences. Courts have different powers depending on the level of offence, ranging from fines and community sentences to custodial sentences. Sentencing aims include punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation and public protection, and modern debates often centre on the balance between punishment and efforts to reduce reoffending.

## Policing, prosecution and rights
Policing involves prevention, detection and investigation. Police powers include stopping, searching, arresting and gathering evidence, but these powers are constrained by law and oversight mechanisms designed to protect rights. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in Scotland and Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales decide whether to prosecute based on evidence and public interest. An informed understanding of rights—such as the right to legal representation and the right to a fair trial—helps to explain safeguards built into the system. Public confidence in policing and prosecution is crucial: where communities are distrustful, reporting falls and cooperation with investigations weakens. Examples such as community policing initiatives, problem-oriented policing to deal with repeat locations of anti‑social behaviour, and restorative justice pilots illustrate attempts to improve relationships between the police and the communities they serve.

## Prisons, alternatives and effectiveness
Prisons aim to punish, protect the public and rehabilitate offenders, but their effectiveness is widely debated. High reoffending rates and problems such as overcrowding, poor mental health care and lack of education or work opportunities in custody are often highlighted. Alternatives to prison, used to different extents across Scotland and the UK, include community payback orders, electronic monitoring, fines, restorative justice and diversion programmes for young offenders. The Children’s Hearings System provides welfare-centred disposals for children and young people, emphasising care plans and support alongside accountability. Evaluating effectiveness means asking whether a response reduces reoffending, addresses the causes of offending and supports victim recovery. Many studies and policy debates point towards early intervention, education, drug and alcohol treatment and community-based support as more effective in the long term than short custodial sentences for low-level or non-violent offending.

## Crime and social groups: class, age, gender and minority communities
Crime does not affect all people equally, and the course requires you to be able to apply knowledge across at least two social groups such as social class, age, gender and minority communities. Young people are over-represented in certain offence types, particularly non-violent and status offences, which raises questions about underlying causes such as schooling, peer influence and employment prospects. Men are more likely to be both perpetrators and victims of violent crime, while women are disproportionately affected by certain crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual offences. People from lower socio-economic backgrounds often live in neighbourhoods with higher crime rates, and experiences of discrimination can affect both the likelihood of offending and the treatment people receive within the justice process. Minority ethnic communities can experience both higher victimisation in some contexts and concerns about discriminatory policing and over-representation in custody. Understanding these patterns is essential for evaluating policies aimed at fairness, inclusion and effectiveness.

## Using evidence: sources, interpretation and evaluation
Modern Studies asks you to evaluate information from a range of sources and to make reasoned judgements. Different sources have different strengths and limitations: official statistics are authoritative but may not capture unreported crime; academic research can offer careful analysis but often focuses on specific contexts; media reports are immediate and accessible but can be sensational or partial. Primary methods such as surveys, interviews and questionnaires can generate original evidence for assignments, but they must be designed and interpreted carefully to avoid bias. When comparing sources, look for corroboration, timeliness, methodology and purpose. A careful evaluation will identify whether data is representative, whether a study controls for other factors, and whether a source is trying to persuade as well as to inform. Being able to explain why one source is more reliable than another and to link evidence to clear conclusions is a key skill for both the question paper and the assignment.

## Exam technique
Answering Modern Studies questions well means combining knowledge with clear skills. For knowledge questions, focus on specific, contemporary examples and develop each point to earn higher marks rather than trying to write everything you know. For source‑based and skills questions, examine what the source shows and what it does not show; compare evidence across sources and draw balanced conclusions supported by more than one piece of evidence. In option and decision-making questions explicitly state which option you choose and give clear reasons, then explain why you rejected the alternative. For the assignment, choose a concise contemporary topic, use at least two different types of source, and make sure your Modern Studies Research Sheet records your methods and evidence rather than acting as a plan or containing verbatim copied material. Practice timing under exam conditions, label which part of the question you are answering, and structure longer responses with short paragraphs that make one clear point each, linked to evidence. Finally, show evaluative thinking by weighing strengths and weaknesses, considering unintended consequences, and, when appropriate, suggesting realistic alternatives. These habits will make your responses clearer, more persuasive and more likely to gain high marks.
