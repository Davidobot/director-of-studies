# Role and powers of the First Minister and Scottish Government (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What the Scottish Government is and where the First Minister fits
The Scottish Government is the devolved executive responsible for running public services and making policy in areas that have been transferred from the UK Parliament to the Scottish Parliament. The First Minister is the political leader of that executive. In practice the First Minister is the most visible face of Scottish politics: they set the overall direction of government policy, lead the Cabinet, represent Scotland in many domestic and international settings (within devolved responsibilities) and act as the principal link between the Scottish Parliament and the executive. It helps to think of the First Minister as Scotland’s chief minister — similar in role to the UK Prime Minister but working only on devolved areas such as health, education and justice.

## How the First Minister is chosen and the formal powers that come with the office
After a Scottish Parliament election (or if the office becomes vacant mid-term), Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) nominate a candidate for First Minister. The Parliament votes and the nominee who gains a majority is recommended to the Monarch for formal appointment. Once appointed, the First Minister has the authority to recommend people for ministerial posts, to organise the structure of the Scottish Government and to nominate Cabinet Secretaries and junior ministers. The First Minister chairs Cabinet meetings and decides the agenda, giving them formal power to coordinate policy and to propose the government's legislative priorities to Parliament.

## Executive powers: leadership, decisions and the Cabinet
The First Minister leads a collective executive known as the Scottish Cabinet. The Cabinet is the main decision-making forum and is responsible for agreeing major policies, often after discussion and negotiation among Cabinet Secretaries. The principle of collective responsibility means that once the Cabinet agrees a policy, all members are expected to support it publicly. The First Minister therefore has strong influence over what the Cabinet discusses and the priorities it sets, but in practice their power depends on their political position — holding a majority, leading a coalition, or running a minority government will affect how easily they can push through their agenda. The First Minister also oversees the civil service that implements government decisions and manages the Scottish Government’s departments and public bodies.

## Law-making, legislation and the Scottish Budget
If the Scottish Government wants to change policy, it can propose Bills to the Scottish Parliament. These government Bills are drafted by ministers and brought to Parliament for debate, amendment and vote. The Scottish Parliament has the power to pass laws in devolved areas; it also scrutinises and holds the government to account for how laws are implemented. Each year the Scottish Government prepares a Budget setting out planned spending on devolved services such as the NHS Scotland, schools, social services and transport. The Budget combines revenue raised in Scotland (for example, some devolved taxes) with the block grant received from the UK Government. The First Minister plays a central role in setting spending priorities and negotiating the Budget through Parliament.

## Devolved and reserved powers: where the Scottish Government can act — and where it cannot
Understanding the limits of the First Minister’s power means distinguishing devolved from reserved matters. Devolved areas under the control of the Scottish Government include health, education, most aspects of justice and policing, housing, environment and many transport issues. Reserved matters — those handled by the UK Parliament and UK Government — include defence, foreign affairs, immigration, macroeconomic policy and overall social security rules (although aspects of welfare have been progressively devolved). The Sewel convention is a political agreement that the UK Parliament will not normally legislate on devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament; it is a convention rather than a legal rule, but it shapes how the two governments interact. Where policy lines blur, the First Minister must negotiate with the UK Government, often through formal and informal channels, and through mechanisms such as intergovernmental committees.

## Relationships with the UK Government, international representation and emergency powers
The First Minister and Scottish Government frequently need to work with the UK Government, particularly where issues cross devolved and reserved boundaries or where UK-wide funding and regulation matter. Finance, migration and international agreements are examples where coordination is essential. While the Scottish Government cannot sign treaties in its own right, it can take part in international visits, promote Scotland’s interests abroad in devolved fields, and enter non-binding agreements with other governments or organisations. In times of crisis the Scottish Government has powers to act under devolved legislation and civil contingencies arrangements. However, large-scale or UK-wide emergencies may involve UK Government powers and shared responsibilities, which again require negotiation and cooperation.

## Accountability, scrutiny and limits on power
The First Minister and their ministers are accountable to the Scottish Parliament. Accountability takes place through oral questions (including weekly First Minister’s Questions), written questions, parliamentary debates and detailed work by parliamentary committees that scrutinise ministers’ actions, examine policy, call for evidence and publish reports. The Parliament can force a government change through votes of no confidence; a lost confidence motion normally leads to resignation or a new nomination for First Minister and may trigger an election. Courts also limit the Scottish Government: legislation or ministerial actions can be challenged if they go beyond the powers legally granted to the Scottish Parliament (a question of competence). Politically, the First Minister’s power is also constrained by public opinion, the media, relationships with local government, the fiscal position of the Scottish Budget and the need to maintain party unity or coalition agreements.

## Examples that show the First Minister and Scottish Government in action
Concrete policy examples help to turn abstract powers into real-world understanding. Health and education show distinctive Scottish approaches because these areas are devolved. Decisions such as prescription policies, school structures and the organisation of NHS Scotland are made by Scottish ministers and reflect Scottish priorities. On alcohol policy, the Scottish Government introduced minimum unit pricing for alcohol as a devolved public health measure to reduce harmful drinking; this illustrates how a devolved government can design specific policies to address social problems. During periods of shared challenges such as a pandemic, the Scottish Government made public health decisions for Scotland, sometimes taking different approaches from the UK Government; these differences underline how devolved powers produce distinct policies. Budget choices — deciding to prioritise social care or to invest in early years education — show how the First Minister’s leadership translates into spending and service delivery. In each example the government’s freedom to act was shaped by legal competence, parliamentary support and financial constraints.

## Exam technique
When answering questions about the First Minister and the Scottish Government, begin by making the focus of your answer clear: define the First Minister’s role and say whether you are discussing formal powers, practical influence or limits on power. Use specific, contemporary examples to illustrate points — for instance, refer to devolved policy areas such as health and education, or to a policy (like minimum unit pricing) that shows the Scottish Government in action. For description questions, give clear, factual explanations of processes such as how the First Minister is nominated and appointed, how the Scottish Cabinet operates and how the Budget is prepared and passed. For explanation questions, move beyond description to show cause and effect: explain how having devolved powers allows different policy choices, or how lacking fiscal autonomy can limit action. For evaluation and source-based questions, consider strengths and weaknesses: discuss the First Minister’s leadership and ability to set priorities, but also evaluate constraints such as reserved powers, funding limits or parliamentary opposition. Always structure longer answers with an introduction, two or three developed paragraphs each making a clear point supported by evidence or an example, and a short conclusion that brings your analysis together. In source questions, compare what the sources say and use your own knowledge to support or challenge the views given. Remember the demands of question rubrics: if asked for “two ways” or “maximum of three reasons” give precisely that number of developed points rather than listing many brief ideas. Use terminology correctly — devolved, reserved, collective responsibility, competence, Budget — and aim to link factual knowledge to analysis and evaluation to gain the higher marks.
