# Voting systems and representation (AMS for MSPs, FPTP for MPs) (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: two systems, two choices
Scotland uses the Additional Member System (AMS) to elect Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), while the United Kingdom uses First Past the Post (FPTP) to elect Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons. AMS was introduced to combine the traditional local link of a constituency representative with a second element intended to make outcomes more proportional to the votes cast. FPTP, by contrast, is a simple single-member plurality system: the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins. These different designs have predictable consequences for representation, party systems, government formation and voter behaviour. Understanding the mechanics of each system and their typical effects helps explain why Scottish politics at Holyrood looks different from UK politics in Westminster.

## How AMS works for MSPs
The Scottish Parliament has 129 seats, of which 73 are constituency seats and 56 are regional seats. Each voter has two votes: one for a constituency MSP, decided by FPTP, and a second for a party (or an individual) on a regional list. Scotland is divided into eight regions; each region elects seven regional MSPs. After constituency results are declared, regional seats are allocated using the d’Hondt method. This method divides a party’s regional vote by the number of constituency seats it has already won in that region plus one, and then awards the highest quotients a regional seat, repeating until all seats are filled. The regional top-ups are intended to correct, to some extent, the distortions created by constituency wins, so parties that do well in constituency contests receive fewer list seats while those under-represented by constituencies gain additional representation. The combined system preserves a local MSP for small geographic areas while producing a parliament that more closely reflects the overall pattern of party support than FPTP alone.

## How FPTP works for MPs
First Past the Post divides the UK into 650 single-member constituencies. In each constituency the candidate with the largest number of votes is elected, even if that candidate wins less than an absolute majority. The simplicity of FPTP makes it easy for voters to understand and for counting to be quick and decisive. The system tends to produce single-party governments because the translation of votes into seats usually benefits larger parties, granting them a “winner’s bonus” that amplifies their parliamentary representation relative to their national vote share. At the same time, FPTP frequently disadvantages smaller parties whose support is widely spread but thin, and it produces many “safe seats” where the same party wins repeatedly, reducing the competitiveness of many local contests.

## Strengths of AMS
AMS addresses two common democratic goals at once: a clear local representative and greater proportionality. The constituency element keeps an identifiable MSP who can take on local casework, attend surgeries and represent neighbourhood concerns. The regional list makes the overall result fairer for parties with significant but geographically dispersed support, helping them obtain seats commensurate with their vote share. This can increase the diversity of the legislature because parties often use lists to include candidates who improve gender balance or reflect minority groups, and because smaller parties have a realistic path to representation. AMS also encourages coalition or consensual politics more often than FPTP, which can lead to more negotiated policy-making and to governments that must compromise and justify their decisions across parties.

## Weaknesses of AMS
Despite its benefits, AMS is not perfectly proportional and can be complex in practice. The d’Hondt calculation only corrects some distortions, so a large landslide in constituency seats can still overwhelm list top-ups, producing a parliament that looks less proportional than voters might expect. The existence of two types of MSP — constituency and regional — sometimes leads to perceptions of unequal legitimacy, with list MSPs seen by some voters as “second-tier” because they are not tied to a small constituency. Parties can also try to game the system by concentrating efforts or manipulating candidate lists, and split-ticket voting by electors can produce unpredictable outcomes. Finally, coalition or minority governments, while more consensual, can be seen by voters as less decisive, and coalition negotiations may dilute clear policy mandates.

## Strengths of FPTP
FPTP is straightforward and delivers clear outcomes quickly. It provides a strong and direct link between a single named MP and a defined constituency, which supports accountability, casework and local representation. The system often produces single-party majority governments that can implement their policies without the delays of coalition bargaining, offering clarity of responsibility so voters know which party to reward or punish at the next general election. For voters, the simplicity of FPTP reduces administrative complexity and makes individual contests easy to follow, which can help engagement at a local level where a constituency campaign is visible and personal.

## Weaknesses of FPTP
The most frequently criticised feature of FPTP is its disproportionality. A party can win a large majority of seats without winning a majority of votes, and smaller parties with significant national support may gain few or no seats. This can create many wasted votes—those cast for losing candidates—and can encourage tactical voting, where electors choose the candidate most likely to defeat their least preferred option rather than the one they most support. The system tends to marginalise minority viewpoints and can under-represent women and ethnic minorities, although candidate selection and local dynamics also matter. FPTP can also entrench regional divides; for example, a party whose support is geographically concentrated can win many seats with a relatively small share of the national vote, while a party with evenly spread support may struggle to convert votes into seats.

## Representation: MSPs, MPs, committees and diversity
Both MSPs and MPs have duties to represent their constituents, but the focus of their work differs because of the division of powers. MSPs debate and legislate on devolved matters such as education, health and housing, and they work through the Scottish Parliament’s committee system to scrutinise the Scottish Government, test evidence and shape policy. Committees play a key role in detailed scrutiny, drawing in expert witnesses and producing reports that hold ministers to account. MPs focus on reserved matters at Westminster including defence, foreign policy and taxation, and they scrutinise the UK Government through Prime Minister’s Questions, debates and House of Commons select committees. Representation of women and minority groups has tended to improve under AMS because party list recruitment can correct imbalances more effectively; parties can place diverse candidates high on lists or use positive actions such as zipping to alternate genders. Under FPTP improvement in diversity depends more on local party selection processes, with variable outcomes across constituencies. Voters also use their two votes under AMS in strategic ways, often supporting a preferred local candidate from one party and using the regional vote to boost a different party overall, while in FPTP the lack of a second vote increases the incentive for tactical behaviour within single contests.

## Real-world effects and examples
The different incentives of AMS and FPTP shape party behaviour and electoral outcomes. In Scottish Parliament elections, AMS has led to more parties being represented than in Westminster, and has made coalition and minority administrations relatively common, encouraging negotiation and proportional policy-making. Nevertheless, strong constituency performance can still give a dominant party an advantage despite AMS top-ups. At Westminster, general elections have produced dramatic seat bonuses and landslides that did not always reflect national vote shares; parties with concentrated support have occasionally seen major gains in seats. These patterns matter beyond statistics: they affect voter perceptions of fairness, the legitimacy of governments and the kinds of policies that are possible. The interaction between systems also matters when the same voters face both types of elections, as Scottish voters do: they may experience more plural politics at Holyrood and more majoritarian politics at Westminster, which can influence voting strategies, party image and trust in institutions.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on voting systems and representation, begin by succinctly defining the system you are describing and explaining how it operates in practice. For AMS, state the two votes, the split between constituency and regional MSPs, the existence of 129 MSPs and the use of the d’Hondt method to allocate top-up seats. For FPTP, define single-member constituencies and the plurality rule. Use specific, contemporary examples to illustrate typical outcomes: for instance, how FPTP can produce a “winner’s bonus” and how AMS tends to increase the number of represented parties and improve proportionality. When asked to evaluate strengths and weaknesses, balance your answer: explain clear benefits such as local accountability under FPTP and proportional fairness under AMS, then discuss the trade-offs such as wasted votes and tactical voting in FPTP and perceived legitimacy issues for list MSPs under AMS. In higher-mark questions, structure your response with a short introduction, two to three developed analytical paragraphs comparing and contrasting the systems, and a clear conclusion that answers the question directly. Where source-based or data questions are set, integrate evidence from the sources to support and challenge the claim, make comparisons, and reach a judgement that uses both the sources and your own knowledge. Remember to address key terms in the question, to explain rather than simply describe, and to keep examples relevant and up to date.
