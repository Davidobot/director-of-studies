# Scottish Parliament: devolved and reserved powers (GCSE Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What devolution means for Scotland
Devolution is the transfer of certain political powers from the central UK Parliament in Westminster to a separate legislature in Scotland, known as the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood. Devolution was established with the Scotland Act and the first elections in 1999, and has been adjusted since then so that Holyrood now has authority over many day-to-day public services and policy areas affecting people’s lives in Scotland. The idea is that decisions on issues such as health, education and local justice are taken closer to the people who use those services, allowing policies to reflect Scottish priorities. At the same time, the UK Parliament remains sovereign and continues to hold powers over matters that affect the UK as a whole. Understanding which issues are devolved and which are reserved is central to understanding how decisions are made, who is accountable for them, and how citizens can participate.

## Devolved and reserved matters: clear examples and grey areas
Devolved matters are those policy areas that the Scottish Parliament can legislate on. These include health and the National Health Service in Scotland, education and school funding, justice and policing, transport, the environment and many aspects of social policy. The Scottish Parliament can pass its own laws in these fields and set policy priorities differently to the rest of the UK. Reserved matters are those kept by the UK Parliament and government. These typically include foreign affairs, defence and national security, immigration, monetary policy and the overall constitution of the United Kingdom. There are also partial devolutions and shared responsibilities in some areas: for example, certain taxation powers and some social security functions have been devolved to Scotland in stages, and the Scottish Government can set rates for some taxes while other taxes remain reserved. Because devolution has evolved over time, and because some issues cross boundaries, there are frequent discussions about competence — whether a particular proposed Scottish law falls within devolved powers — and occasional disputes about where responsibility lies.

## How the Scottish Parliament is organised and how it is elected
The Scottish Parliament is made up of 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). It uses the Additional Member System (AMS) for elections: voters have two votes, one to elect a constituency MSP by first-past-the-post and another for a regional party list that produces additional members to make the overall result more proportional. This mixed system combines local representation with correction for proportionality, so that parties that win many votes but few constituencies can still gain seats through the regional lists. The Parliament operates through debates, votes and committees. Committees are powerful tools for detailed scrutiny; they examine proposed laws, hold ministers to account, take evidence from experts and the public, and investigate issues of concern. MSPs represent different roles: constituency MSPs handle local casework and community concerns, while regional MSPs often focus on broader policy issues and scrutiny. The structure encourages both local accessibility and policy expertise, though the system also has strengths and weaknesses that are often debated in class and exam questions.

## Powers of the First Minister and the Scottish Government
The Scottish Government, led by the First Minister, is responsible for proposing and implementing policies within devolved areas. The First Minister is nominated by the Scottish Parliament and then appointed, and they select ministers to head the government departments that manage education, health, justice and other devolved services. The government develops a legislative programme, produces budgets for devolved spending, and represents Scotland in discussions with the UK government and international partners on matters within devolved competence. Ministers are accountable to Parliament through questions, debates and committee scrutiny. The power to set priorities, allocate public spending and introduce bills gives the government real influence over everyday life in Scotland, from hospital waiting times to school curricula, but this influence is balanced by parliamentary oversight and the need to work within the limits of devolved competence and UK-wide frameworks where they apply.

## Law-making, budgets and taxes in a devolved system
The Scottish Parliament passes Acts that apply in Scotland in devolved areas. Proposed laws begin as bills, which are examined by committees, debated in the chamber, and voted on in stages. Once passed, Acts are implemented by the Scottish Government. Budgets reflect the distribution of spending between reserved and devolved services. Scotland receives funding from the UK Government but also has some powers to raise revenue. Recent stages of devolution have given Holyrood greater control over a limited range of taxes, allowing the Scottish Parliament to set certain rates and bands to reflect national priorities. However, many major taxes remain reserved, meaning that the Scottish Government must manage priorities with a combination of its devolved resources and funds from Westminster. This mixed funding model influences political debates about fairness, efficiency and democratic accountability, and is a common focus of examination questions that test understanding of power, responsibility and outcomes.

## Participation, influence and representation in Scottish politics
People in Scotland can participate in politics in many ways: by voting in Scottish Parliament elections, contacting MSPs, joining political parties, backing a pressure group or trade union, taking part in demonstrations, and using the media or social media to express views. The Scottish Parliament has formal mechanisms to encourage participation, such as public consultations and committee hearings that take evidence from community groups and experts. Representation is a recurring theme: the Parliament has often achieved a higher proportion of women MSPs than the UK Parliament, and there are continuing efforts to improve representation for ethnic minorities and disadvantaged groups. Pressure groups, trade unions and the media play important roles in shaping public debate and influencing policy. Committees and public petitions provide channels for civic engagement and for holding the government to account. Understanding how influence is exercised and how different voices are heard is essential for evaluating the effectiveness and fairness of Scottish democracy.

## Devolution in practice: interaction with Westminster and contemporary debates
Devolution does not mean complete separation. The Scottish Parliament and UK Parliament must work together, and mechanisms such as the Sewel Convention (where Westminster will not normally legislate on devolved matters without consent) and intergovernmental forums are part of that relationship. Tensions can arise when policies in one part of the UK have knock-on effects elsewhere, or when UK-wide issues such as Brexit raise questions about the limits of devolved powers. Contemporary debates often focus on whether devolution should be extended or reformed, how resources are shared across the UK, and how differences in policy between Scotland and the rest of the UK should be managed. These debates provide rich material for Modern Studies students: they offer opportunities to discuss real examples, weigh arguments about effectiveness and democracy, and consider how institutional design shapes political outcomes.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on devolved and reserved powers, start by defining key terms clearly: explain what “devolved” and “reserved” mean and give one or two precise examples to set the context. For knowledge questions, use specific, contemporary examples (for instance, citing education or the NHS as devolved, and defence or foreign affairs as reserved) to show understanding. For explanation questions, follow each point with a clear reason and, where possible, link to an effect on citizens or policy outcomes. When asked to evaluate or compare, balance your answer by considering strengths and weaknesses and showing how they affect different groups; for example, explain how the Additional Member System increases proportionality but can make accountability more complex. For source-based or skills questions, refer directly to the evidence, draw comparisons, look for changes over time or differences between regions, and clearly justify your conclusions using more than one piece of evidence. In decision-making or options questions, explicitly state which option you choose and explain why you rejected the other option, giving reasons supported by facts and analysis. For assignment work, choose a focused, contemporary topic that fits the brief, use the research sheet to record sources and methods rather than copying content, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your research methods, and draw a clear, evidence-backed conclusion. Time management is crucial in the question paper: allocate time to plan, write and check your answers and ensure long-answer questions are structured with an introduction, developed points and a concise conclusion. Practising past-style questions, using up-to-date examples and learning to link institutions to real-life impacts will help you show the detailed understanding and evaluation skills the exam requires.
