# Morality, medicine and the human body: embryos, donation and end of life (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Key ideas and how to approach this topic
This topic brings together philosophical arguments, religious teachings and real-world medical practice. You will encounter technical terms (for example, embryo, therapeutic cloning, brain death, assisted dying) and ethical concepts (such as sanctity of life, personhood, autonomy and the principle of double effect). A good revision approach is to be clear about definitions, to show how different moral principles yield different conclusions, and to connect those conclusions to specific religious teachings or traditions. Where policy or law is relevant, explain how it affects choices in practice; where scientific detail matters, explain enough to show why the moral issue arises (for example, what embryonic stem cells are and why they offer medical hope). In exams you will be expected not only to describe positions but to analyse and evaluate them, so always follow description with reasoned analysis and end with a supported judgement.

## The use of embryos: reproductive, therapeutic and research contexts
Embryos appear in three broad medical contexts: reproductive medicine (in vitro fertilisation and related practices), therapeutic applications (embryonic stem cells for treatment) and research (studying early development to learn about disease). Reproductive use raises questions about embryo selection, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and the status of spare embryos that remain after IVF. Therapeutic use focuses on the potential of embryonic stem cells to repair damaged tissues, while research use considers whether manipulating or discarding embryos can be justified by future benefits. In the UK, legislation and regulation permit research on early embryos under strict conditions, and scientific practice has often been guided by a fourteen-day limit for embryo research, a boundary linked to early developmental milestones. Ethically, debates centre on whether embryos have moral status equivalent to persons, whether the potential of an embryo to become a person creates a duty of protection, and whether the likely benefits of research (new treatments, greater understanding) outweigh the moral cost of destroying embryos. Consequentialist arguments tend to support embryonic research when it promises significant medical gain, whereas deontological or sanctity-of-life arguments object because they treat the embryo as having an inviolable status from conception. Religious traditions vary: some teach that life begins at conception and should not be intentionally destroyed; others locate moral significance later in development, permitting carefully regulated research. When discussing embryos in an exam, balance biological detail with ethical reasoning and always show awareness of competing values.

## Organ donation: consent, types and ethical tensions
Organ donation raises questions of consent, bodily integrity, the definition of death and the ethics of allocation. Consent can be explicit (informed consent given by the donor) or presumed/deemed unless a person has opted out; the latter is the basis of modern opt-out systems. Donors may be living (most commonly kidneys or parts of a liver) or deceased; among deceased donors there are those declared dead by neurological criteria (brain death) whose organs are removed while the heart is still beating, sometimes called beating-heart donation, and those where donation follows circulatory death. Ethical issues include whether presumed consent risks overriding individual autonomy, how families should be involved in decision-making, and whether financial incentives or organ markets would be morally acceptable. Religious responses are often supportive because donation can save lives and is an act of charity, but some traditions place a strong emphasis on bodily respect after death or require particular procedures for burial; these concerns must be weighed against the moral urgency of saving another person. Non-religious ethics commonly supports donation on utilitarian grounds—maximising lives saved—and on principle-based grounds that respect autonomy and generosity, while also probing fairness in allocation and access.

## End of life: assisted dying, euthanasia and palliative care
End-of-life questions cover a spectrum from withdrawal of life-prolonging treatment to assisted dying and euthanasia. Assisted dying typically means providing a competent person with the means to end their own life, whereas euthanasia refers to someone else intentionally causing death, which can be voluntary (at the patient's request) or non-voluntary (without explicit consent because the patient lacks capacity). Palliative care seeks to relieve suffering without hastening death, although the principle of double effect recognises that pain relief may have the foreseeable but unintended consequence of shortening life; many ethicists accept this distinction when the primary intention is care, not killing. Legal frameworks vary: assisted dying is illegal in much of the UK, which shapes clinical practice and public debate. Ethical arguments in favour of assisted dying stress respect for autonomy, relief from intolerable suffering and compassion. Arguments against often appeal to the sanctity of life, the danger of abuses or pressure on vulnerable people, and the social implications of normalising assisted death. Many religious traditions oppose active measures to end life, emphasise the intrinsic value of life, and instead prioritise improved palliative care, while others focus on the moral importance of intention and the alleviation of suffering. In developing answers, make clear distinctions between types of end-of-life action and show how different moral principles and religious teachings lead to different practical conclusions.

## Religious and non-religious ethical perspectives
Different religious traditions supply distinctive principles that shape responses to embryos, donation and end of life, but there is also significant overlap. Christianity often emphasises the sanctity of life and the belief that human beings are made in the image of God, leading many Christians to be cautious about destroying embryos and to oppose active euthanasia, while also affirming organ donation as an act of love in many denominations. Judaism contains a range of views; classical texts give special weight to the preservation of life but also present nuanced ideas about the beginning of life and the permissibility of interventions, meaning some forms of research or withdrawal of burdensome treatment can be permitted. Islam commonly stresses the protection of life and dignity, and although views vary, many scholars allow organ donation and medical research under strict conditions and oppose active euthanasia while permitting withholding of disproportionate treatment. Eastern traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism place importance on intention and reducing suffering; this often leads to sympathetic attitudes toward research and donation when motives aim at compassion, while careful reflection is required about the taking of life. Sikhism and other faiths also typically encourage service and helping others, which can support donation. Non-religious moral theories play a central role in public debate: utilitarianism judges actions by consequences and is often in favour of practices that increase wellbeing, while deontological theories may insist on rights or duties that limit what can be done even for good outcomes. Virtue ethics asks what a compassionate, wise person would do. When answering exam questions, show how these frameworks produce different judgments and evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses in context.

## Teaching, case studies and classroom discussion
To teach this topic effectively use real-world cases and carefully constructed thought experiments to illuminate abstract principles. Case studies of families facing organ donation decisions, patients requesting assisted dying, or the ethical choices around surplus IVF embryos help students connect ethical theory to lived experience. Encourage students to role-play positions, to prepare short reasoned arguments for opposing views, and to practise writing concise definitions and structured essays. When planning lessons, integrate scientific background so students understand why certain ethical questions arise: for example, what embryonic stem cells can do, how brain death is diagnosed, or the clinical aims of palliative care. Provide comparison charts in class notes (but not in exam responses) that summarise how particular religions approach each issue, always emphasising internal diversity within traditions. Assessment preparation should emphasise the skills the course requires: clear knowledge and understanding, analysis that explains reasons and implications, and evaluation that reaches a reasoned conclusion. Encourage students to use contemporary policy examples—such as opt-out organ donation systems and public debates over assisted dying—to show awareness of how moral arguments function in public life.

## Exam technique
In exams start by defining key terms to establish clarity: explain what is meant by embryo, therapeutic use, presumed consent, assisted dying, euthanasia and palliative care. For descriptive parts, report accurately and succinctly the different religious or philosophical positions. When analysing, move beyond description to explain why a position follows from particular principles—for example, why sanctity of life leads to opposition to embryo destruction, or why utilitarianism supports donation and research. For evaluation, weigh strengths and weaknesses: examine practical consequences, the plausibility of underlying assumptions (such as the moral status of embryos), and issues of fairness or vulnerability. Use comparative evaluation by showing how one framework answers a challenge that another cannot, and finish with a clear, justified conclusion that reflects the evidence and arguments you have discussed. Throughout, reference specific examples or policies where appropriate, maintain clear paragraph structure, and demonstrate an awareness of the complexity and diversity of religious responses rather than presenting any tradition as monolithic.
