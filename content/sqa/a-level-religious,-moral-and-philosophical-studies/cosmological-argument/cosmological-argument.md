# Philosophy of religion: cosmological argument (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What the cosmological argument seeks to do
The cosmological argument is a family of a posteriori arguments that begin with the existence, contingency or order of the universe and attempt to show that there must be some ultimate explanation — commonly identified with God. Unlike the ontological argument, which tries to deduce God’s existence from the concept of God alone, cosmological reasoning appeals to experience: because things change, depend on causes, or come into being, we are invited to infer that there must be some sufficient, necessary or uncaused ground for everything. In an examination context it is useful to keep that basic structure in mind: starting point (what we observe about the world), inference (why that observation makes a further claim plausible), and conclusion (what kind of being, if any, is required by the inference). The cosmological tradition is not a single argument but a cluster of related moves developed by thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas, Gottfried Leibniz, medieval Islamic philosophers, and contemporary defenders of the Kalam form.

## Aquinas: motion, causation and contingency
Thomas Aquinas formulated three variants—often called his “ways”—that are classical expressions of cosmological reasoning. The argument from motion begins with the obvious fact that things move or undergo change. Aquinas accepted Aristotelian physics: things change because actualisers bring potentialities into actuality. To avoid an infinite regress of movers, Aquinas posits an Unmoved Mover that initiates or sustains motion without itself being moved. The argument from efficient cause focuses on causal chains: every caused thing has a cause, and since an infinite regress of causes is, for Aquinas, impossible, there must be a first uncaused cause. The argument from contingency observes that contingent beings — those that can either exist or not exist — make up the world. If everything were contingent, there would be a possible state in which nothing exists; but from nothing nothing comes, so there must be a necessary being whose existence is not explained by anything else. Teaching these arguments well means emphasising their shared logic: they all try to block an infinite regress by positing a terminus that is metaphysically different from ordinary beings. Using everyday analogies helps: a row of falling dominos suggests a mover behind the first domino, and the contingency argument can be likened to a library of books that requires an explanation other than the books themselves.

## Leibniz and the Principle of Sufficient Reason
Leibniz approached the question from the standpoint of explanation. His Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) asserts that for every truth or existential fact there is a reason why it is so rather than otherwise. Applied to the universe, the claim is that there must be an explanation for why there is a universe at all. Leibniz then argues that this explanation cannot be merely internal to the universe — it must reach to a necessary being whose essence explains its existence. The cosmological argument thus becomes a demand for intelligibility: the existence of the cosmos cries out for a why. Teaching Leibniz requires clarifying what “necessary” means: a necessary being exists in every possible world; its non-existence is impossible. Critics respond by asking why the PSR should be accepted unqualifiedly and by pressing Leibniz to explain why the ultimate reason must be a personal God rather than a metaphysical brute fact. Leibniz’s reply depends on showing that the best possible explanation of the totality of facts is a mind that chooses the best world, which introduces teleological considerations. For revision purposes, contrast Leibniz’s intellectual, explanatory style with Aquinas’s more empirical, Aristotelian approach.

## The Kalam cosmological argument and the beginning of the universe
The Kalam cosmological argument has its roots in medieval Islamic thought but finds a modern champion in philosophers who stress the impossibility of an actual infinite past. The basic form asserts: everything that begins to exist has a cause; the universe began to exist; therefore the universe has a cause. Advocates use both philosophical arguments about the impossibility of actual infinities (for example, paradoxes that arise if past events are infinite) and empirical evidence from cosmology to support the claim that the universe had a beginning. Defenders characterise the cause as personal in order to explain why a timeless or purely impersonal cause could bring temporal reality into being. Teaching Kalam demands careful attention to the premises: students should be able to explain what “begins to exist” means, why the denial of an actual infinite is contested, and how contemporary physics bears on the claim. Important classroom examples include thought experiments about infinite sets and the status of singularities in cosmological models. A sound revision strategy is to prepare both scientific and philosophical objections: cosmology may suggest a quantum origin or bouncing models that complicate the claim that the universe “began to exist,” and philosophers retort that even if the universe has an earlier physical history, metaphysical dependence may still require explanation.

## Main philosophical criticisms and theists’ replies
Philosophers have developed sharp criticisms of cosmological moves. David Hume questioned whether causal principles derived from our experience within the world can be extrapolated to the world as a whole. He used analogies — a son has a mother, but the human race does not need a single human parent — to deny that the existence of a cause for every particular implies a cause for the total. Bertrand Russell famously suggested that “the universe is just there,” rejecting the demand for an external explanation. Another persistent attack is the fallacy of composition: what is true of parts need not be true of the whole. Critics also highlight special pleading: if everything needs a cause, why exempt God? Defenders reply in various ways. Thomists argue that God is not another contingent member of the causal chain but the sustaining cause whose mode of existence differs fundamentally; to ask for God’s cause is to confuse kinds of explanation. Leibnizians lean on the PSR and insist that the universe requires a sufficient reason, and they seek to show that only a necessary being can fulfil this role. Many contemporary defenders also refine the argument’s logic, distinguishing between causal series that are ordered temporally and those ordered per se, and arguing that an infinite regress does not solve explanatory demands. For revision it is useful to rehearse these exchanges as paired lines of argument: state the criticism fully, then give the best theistic rejoinder and a critical rejoinder to that rejoinder, showing awareness of the dialectic.

## Scientific responses: cosmology, quantum physics and the multiverse
Modern science contributes both support and challenge. The discovery that the universe has a temporal origin — often labelled the Big Bang — was taken by some as affirmative to cosmological claims: if the universe began, then it needs a cause. Yet scientific cosmology does not itself identify a personal cause, nor does it settle metaphysical questions about necessity. Quantum mechanics introduces complications: certain interpretations of quantum events suggest occurrences without classical causes, which supports Humean scepticism about universal causal principles. However, “cause” in cosmology can be understood more broadly as metaphysical grounding rather than strict temporal causation, so quantum indeterminacy does not automatically refute every cosmological move. The multiverse hypothesis provides an alternative to the PSR by suggesting naturalistic explanations for fine-tuning: if many universes exist, then we observe one compatible with life without special design. Defenders of the cosmological argument reply that the multiverse merely shifts the need for explanation to the multiverse itself, and that explanations must account for why there is something rather than nothing. In teaching, emphasise that science and metaphysics operate with different questions: empirical models explain how the cosmos evolves, whereas cosmological arguments ask for the ultimate reason for existence. Students should be prepared to show how scientific claims affect the premises of cosmological arguments but also to note the limits of empirical evidence for metaphysical conclusions.

## Strengths, weaknesses and philosophical significance
The cosmological argument’s strength lies in its appeal to common-sense intuitions: things come to be, and explanations are sought. It pushes students to confront the foundational philosophical issue of why anything exists at all and to explore distinctions between contingent and necessary, cause and ground, temporal and atemporal. Its weaknesses include heavy reliance on contested metaphysical principles (such as the PSR and universal causation) and the difficulty of bridging from a first cause or necessary being to the lived, personal God of particular theologies. Another persistent problem is the “leap” from demonstrating a necessary explanatory ground to attributing to that ground classic divine attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience and moral perfection. Good classroom treatment presents the argument’s internal coherence and its external challenges: show how different forms aim at different explanatory needs, and make clear where objections have force and where replies are plausible but not decisive.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the cosmological argument, begin by setting out the form of the argument you are discussing with clarity and precision. If the question names a particular thinker—Aquinas, Leibniz or the Kalam tradition—explain that thinker’s specific premises and the philosophical vocabulary they use (for example, contingency, necessary being, principle of sufficient reason, or “begins to exist”). Avoid vague generalities: short, accurate definitions and a clear statement of the conclusion earn marks in knowledge and understanding sections. In analysis questions, link premises to consequences and show how one step follows from another; use simple examples or analogies (dominos, causal chains) to show comprehension. For evaluation, balance strengths and weaknesses: give the best version of the cosmological argument, then the strongest objections (Hume, Russell, fallacy of composition, special pleading, scientific challenges), and finally your considered judgement. Always answer the question asked rather than providing a general essay. In source-based questions, read the extract carefully and place it in the broader debate, showing whether it supports, questions or reframes a cosmological claim. Time management matters: allocate roughly equal time to description, analysis and evaluation for longer essay questions, and remember to signpost your structure so examiners can see your line of thought. Demonstrating awareness of both historical context (how thinkers differ) and modern developments (quantum physics, cosmology, multiverse debates) will show depth; but keep technical asides brief and always tie them back to their relevance for the argument.
