# Atheism and critiques of classical theism (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview
Atheism is a position that, in its simplest form, denies the existence of God or gods. In philosophical debate—particularly where the object of criticism is classical theism—atheism does not only take the form of a straightforward denial, but also of a set of arguments intended to show that the God described by classical theism is unlikely, incoherent, or that the burden of proof lies with the theist. Classical theism characterises God as an ultimate, transcendent being who is omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and immutable. This section summarises the main atheist critiques of that conception, and clarifies typical theist responses so that students can evaluate the debate in exam answers and essays.

## What classical theism claims
Classical theism builds on a particular package of divine attributes. God is described as a necessary being who exists outside space and time, sustaining the universe, and possessing maximal power, knowledge and goodness. These claims underpin traditional philosophical arguments for God, such as cosmological and teleological arguments, and shape the kinds of objections atheists raise. Understanding the precise content of these attributes is essential when assessing critiques: for example, “omnipotence” can be understood in different ways (power to do the logically possible, or absolute power without limit), and “omniscience” raises questions about knowledge of future free actions. Many of the philosophical disputes turn on these fine-grained definitions.

## The improbability of God
One strand of atheistic argument argues that the existence of a classical theist God is highly improbable. This moves away from a simple denial towards an evidential or probabilistic claim: given the available evidence about the world—its natural history, the prevalence of suffering, the success of naturalistic explanations—God as classically conceived is an unlikely hypothesis. Contemporary popular expositions frame this as a challenge to the explanatory power of God-talk: if natural science explains so much, the hypothesis of a divine being becomes redundant or unnecessary. Critics often appeal to parsimony, arguing that positing God is an additional hypothesis that lacks independent evidence and therefore should be rejected unless strong reasons favour it.

When teaching this idea, it helps to distinguish between two ways the improbability charge might be presented. One is cumulative: the sum of natural explanations (evolution, cosmology, neuroscience) reduces the need to invoke God. The other is probabilistic and formal: some philosophers attempt to show that, given certain background facts, the probability that a maximally great being exists is low. Students should be able to explain both the intuitive version (science makes God unnecessary) and the more formal probabilistic line, and to consider how theists reply that God can provide the best coherent explanation for features such as the fine-tuning of physical constants or the existence of moral norms.

## Incoherence of the God of classical theism
A second major critique challenges whether the attributes of classical theism form a coherent set. Critics point to apparent contradictions or tensions between divine attributes and observed reality. The classic philosophical puzzles include the problem of evil, which questions how an all-powerful, all-knowing, and wholly good God could allow gratuitous suffering; the omnipotence paradox (for example, can God create a stone so heavy that even God cannot lift it?); and tensions between divine immutability or timelessness and the idea that God acts in history or responds to prayer.

These problems are often presented as logical or conceptual objections: if the defined properties logically entail impossibilities or counterintuitive consequences, then classical theism may be internally incoherent. It is useful for students to see concrete versions of these challenges. The problem of evil can be framed with vivid examples of apparently pointless suffering to make clear why it presses the notion of divine benevolence. The omniscience-free will tension can be illustrated by asking how God could know future free choices without making them necessary, thereby undermining genuine freedom.

When explaining incoherence criticisms, emphasise that they aim not simply to show that God is morally or metaphysically problematic, but that the classical package of attributes might not hang together as a coherent description.

## The presumption of atheism and burden of proof
A related but distinct line of atheist argument concerns the burden of proof. Some atheists argue that the default position should be non-belief: unless someone offers positive evidence for God’s existence, the rational stance is to withhold belief. This idea is sometimes expressed as the “presumption of atheism”: because theism involves a substantive existential claim, the theist bears the responsibility to provide adequate proof, whereas atheism is the neutral stance when evidence is absent.

This argument is pedagogically valuable because it opens discussion about epistemic standards. Students should consider how one defines the neutral starting point, and whether agnosticism or weak atheism (lack of belief) is more accurate than a strong atheistic claim. The debate also raises questions about what counts as evidence in religious contexts: empirical evidence, philosophical argument, experiential testimony, or different standards of warrant. Thought experiments such as Russell’s teapot—an imaginary object posited to show that an unfalsifiable claim does not shift the burden of proof—are useful classroom tools to make the principle concrete.

## Responses to atheistic arguments (philosophical, scientific and theological)
Theists and sympathetic philosophers have developed a variety of responses to the main atheist critiques. Philosophical responses often challenge the premises or logical form of atheistic arguments. For the improbability thesis, some theists argue that God is not just another hypothesis but a necessary being whose existence explains why anything exists at all. Philosophers invoke versions of the cosmological argument or the principle of sufficient reason to claim that the existence of the universe requires a necessary explanation that God uniquely supplies. Others deploy the fine-tuning argument, arguing that the precise constants that allow life are best explained by an intelligent designer rather than chance or multiverse hypotheses. There are also epistemological responses which argue that belief in God can be “properly basic” on the basis of religious experience, shifting the debate away from purely probabilistic grounds.

Against incoherence charges, theists may refine the meaning of divine attributes. For instance, omnipotence is commonly redefined as the power to do all that is logically possible, avoiding paradoxical formulations. Theists have defended the compatibility of divine foreknowledge and human freedom by appealing to alternative models of God’s relation to time—God might be timeless yet know temporal facts, or God might be eternal but within time in a way that preserves freedom. Addressing the problem of evil, theists have offered a range of theodicies and defenses: the free will defense argues that moral evil is a necessary consequence of genuine free agents; soul-making theodicies suggest that suffering can contribute to moral and spiritual development; and greater-good theodicies attempt to show that apparent evils can be outweighed by goods that would not otherwise be possible.

Scientific responses vary in how supportive they are. Some point to cosmology—the Big Bang and the apparent origin of the universe—as compatible with cosmological arguments for a transcendent cause. Conversely, biological evolution is often presented as a naturalistic alternative to teleological explanations of complexity. The debate is therefore partly empirical: different interpretations of scientific data can be marshalled to support either side. Theists often argue that science and theism are not mutually exclusive and that scientific findings may point toward a deeper metaphysical explanation.

Finally, some theological traditions respond by modifying classical theism itself. Process theology and open theism, for example, relax or reinterpret attributes like immutability and exhaustive foreknowledge so that God is understood as a being who changes in relationship to the world or who does not deterministically know future free acts. Such moves aim to avoid incoherence while preserving a central divine role.

## Assessing the debate — strengths and weaknesses
When weighing the arguments, it helps to separate argumentative force from rhetorical power. Atheistic critiques often score high on intuitive appeal: pointing to suffering, to scientific explanations, or to apparent contradictions can be rhetorically persuasive. They also push the theist to clarify definitions and provide robust explanations. On the other hand, many atheistic arguments require philosophical assumptions—for example, about what counts as a satisfactory explanation or what probability assignments are appropriate—that can be contested. Theists reply that some deep features of reality, such as moral values, consciousness, or the very existence of a lawful universe, resist purely naturalistic accounts and are better explained by a divine reality.

Students should be cautious of overstating the success of either side. The problem of evil raises serious questions but does not logically rule out God unless one claims a strict logical inconsistency between attributes and evil. Similarly, scientific explanations may undercut particular theistic arguments without addressing broader metaphysical claims. A mature assessment recognises that both sides advance significant insights: atheism sharpens epistemic standards and demands evidence; theism presses for ultimate explanations and offers a coherent metaphysical picture for many believers. Strong exam answers will identify strengths and weaknesses, show awareness of definitional subtleties, and avoid sweeping claims about conclusive refutation.

## Exam technique
In exam answers, begin by defining key terms with precision: explain what you mean by “classical theism,” “improbability,” or “presumption of atheism.” Use short, focused introductions to set out the structure of your answer—state the arguments you will explain and the responses you will assess. When analysing an argument, separate its premises and conclusion and comment on whether the premises are plausible and the reasoning valid. In evaluation, balance sympathetic representation of the opposing view with critical scrutiny: acknowledge what an argument explains well before pointing out problems or counterexamples. Use relevant examples and thought experiments to illustrate points, such as examples of apparently pointless suffering for the problem of evil, or Russell’s teapot for burden of proof. For source-based questions, link the source to course concepts, explain the source’s implications, and then evaluate its strengths and limitations in light of wider arguments. Aim for clarity and structure in each paragraph—make a point, explain it, and then show why it matters to the overall question. Finally, conclude with a concise but supported judgment that summarises your evaluation and explains what follows from it about the rationality of atheism or the viability of classical theism.
