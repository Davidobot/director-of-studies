# Religious and philosophical questions: origins, God, suffering and miracles (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: what this topic covers and how to approach it
This topic brings together four central philosophical and religious questions that feature across traditions and in secular thought: how the universe and life began, whether God exists, why suffering and evil exist, and whether miracles occur. Each question asks you to combine factual knowledge (for example, key beliefs, doctrines and scientific theories) with skills of analysis and evaluation. In exams you will be expected to explain religious and non‑religious positions, analyse the evidence and arguments offered, and reach a reasoned conclusion. To do this well you need clear descriptions of views from one religious tradition you have studied, an awareness of major philosophical arguments and thinkers, and the ability to compare and weigh different kinds of evidence — scriptural, experiential and scientific.

## Origins: religious and scientific explanations and whether they can meet
Religious traditions have offered a variety of accounts of origins. In the Abrahamic tradition the opening chapters of Genesis present a purposeful creation by God across a sequence of days; Hindu cosmologies often describe cyclical universes with creation and dissolution mediated by divine persons or principles; many strands of Buddhism do not posit a creator deity and focus instead on cycles of conditioned existence (samsara) and the processes that keep rebirth going. These narratives are more than origin stories: they locate humans in relation to the divine, explain moral responsibilities and give meaning to the world.

Modern science offers different explanations. Cosmology points to a hot, dense beginning of the observable universe — the Big Bang — and biology gives a naturalistic account of the diversity of life through evolution by natural selection. Each scientific model rests on empirical evidence and a framework of testable hypotheses. When analysing strengths and weaknesses, note that religious accounts often supply purpose and teleology, answering why there is something rather than nothing, while scientific explanations provide mechanisms, predictive power and empirical support. Weaknesses of religious explanations can include their reliance on metaphor or authority rather than empirical testing; weaknesses of scientific explanations can include limits to what science can currently explain about ultimate origins, and the philosophical question of whether a mechanistic account can address meaning and value.

Compatibility is a live classroom issue. Some people see conflict, especially when literal readings of sacred texts contradict scientific findings. Others adopt complementary models: for example, theological positions that accept evolution as a means by which a creator brings about life (theistic evolution), or readings of scripture that see creation stories as theological rather than scientific. When evaluating compatibility, distinguish different levels of claim — literal historical statements, theological truths about purpose, and scientific accounts of mechanisms — and consider whether they are addressing the same questions.

## Does God exist? Classical arguments and contemporary challenges
Arguments for God’s existence have been central to philosophy of religion. Cosmological arguments begin from the existence of the universe and argue to a necessary cause or first mover; variants include Aquinas’s reliance on motion and causation and the modern Kalam cosmological argument which emphasises a beginning in time. Teleological arguments point to apparent order, fine‑tuning or purpose in nature and infer a designer; William Paley’s watchmaker analogy is a classic example. Moral arguments suggest that objective moral values are best grounded in a divine lawgiver. Ontological arguments reason from the very concept of a maximally great being to its existence, though these are more abstract.

These arguments have strengths: they appeal to intuitive features of reality (contingency, order, moral experience) and can be developed with philosophical rigor. Their weaknesses are significant and important to discuss. Cosmological arguments face questions about the nature of causation at the beginning of the universe and whether a “first cause” must be the theistic God. Teleological arguments are challenged by evolutionary explanations of apparent design, and by the problem of poor design or suboptimal features. Moral arguments must answer whether moral objectivity requires a divine foundation. The ontological argument is criticised as relying on contentious definitions and modal logic.

Non‑religious criticisms include empiricist and sceptical challenges that demand empirical evidence for extraordinary claims; Humean scepticism about inductive inference and design; and naturalistic alternatives that explain the world without invoking the supernatural. The upshot for exam answers is to show balanced understanding: explain the persuasive force of each argument and then analyse the philosophical objections. Conclude by reflecting on whether any single argument provides conclusive proof; in most standard assessments the careful position is that arguments can support belief or make it rational but rarely close the case decisively for everyone.

## The problem of suffering and evil: whose responsibility?
Suffering and evil present a powerful challenge to the idea of an all‑powerful, all‑good God. Philosophically, the problem is often split into the logical problem — the claim that the existence of suffering is incompatible with an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God — and the evidential problem — the claim that the amount and kinds of suffering make God’s existence unlikely. Religions and philosophers respond in different ways.

The Augustinian theodicy explains evil as the privation of good: God created a good world, but evil entered through free will and moral choice, and natural evils are consequences of a now‑fallen creation. This approach emphasises human responsibility and freedom. The Irenaean theodicy treats suffering as soul‑making: humans are created immature and moral growth requires challenges and the possibility of suffering; a world with hardships is a necessary environment for moral development. Process theology takes a different route by proposing that God is not omnipotent in the classical sense and works persuasively rather than coercively within a changing world; here God shares in suffering rather than being its ultimate author.

Each response has strengths and weaknesses. Free‑will theodicies explain moral evil well but struggle with natural disasters and apparently pointless suffering, and with questions about why an omniscient God would create beings whose choices would lead to horrendous evils. Soul‑making provides a meaningful framework but can seem to justify extreme suffering. Process theodicy avoids making God responsible but raises questions about divine power and the traditional attributes of God.

An alternative emphasis is to assign responsibility to human agency: many evils arise from human choices, structural injustice and greed. Analysing human responsibility requires connecting ethical theory to social and historical realities. Good exam answers evaluate both divine and human responsibility and consider whether responsibility can be shared, acknowledging the complexity of the lived world and the variety of religious responses that seek to make sense of suffering without denying the reality of pain.

## Miracles: definitions, explanations and how they function as evidence
Miracles are typically understood as events that are extraordinary, rare, and significant, often interpreted as interventions by a deity that suspend or transcend usual natural processes. Religious traditions present miracles as signs confirming divine action: healings, resurrections and prophetic fulfilments serve theological and pastoral functions within communities. Philosophers and historians examine miracle claims by assessing testimony, context and alternative explanations.

Non‑religious explanations vary. Naturalistic accounts interpret miracle reports as misperception, exaggeration, coincidence, psychological phenomena or as events not yet understood scientifically. Hume famously argued that we should proportion our belief to the evidence and that, since natural laws are confirmed by uniform experience, the probability that a miracle occurred is generally lower than the chance of error in testimony. Other thinkers have offered more nuanced probabilistic treatments, considering the reliability of witnesses, the context of the claim, and the presence of corroborating evidence.

Contemporary philosophers of religion like Richard Swinburne have developed criteria for assessing miracle claims, arguing that a single well‑attested, unexplained event can be rationally accepted as evidence for theism if alternative natural explanations are implausible. When analysing miracles, consider both methodological issues (what kinds of evidence count, how to evaluate testimony) and theological purposes (why believers might accept miracles as meaningful even when natural explanations are possible).

The question of compatibility between religious and non‑religious views about miracles partly mirrors the origins debate: some accept that what appears miraculous may eventually be explainable by science, while others hold that miracles are, by definition, events that break the natural order and point to a transcendent cause. In assessment, distinguish between evidential considerations and the role miracles play within religious life.

## Connecting the themes: evidence, authority and the role of worldview
Across origins, the existence of God, suffering and miracles, a few recurring themes help structure strong revision answers. First, the nature of evidence is central: scriptural testimony, religious experience, philosophical argument and scientific data are different kinds of evidence with distinct standards and limitations. Second, authority and interpretation matter: literal, metaphorical and theological readings of sacred texts produce different conclusions about origins and miracles. Third, worldview shapes how evidence is evaluated: a theistic framework will assess data with different presuppositions than a naturalistic one.

Examples from particular religions help make answers concrete. A Christian student might discuss the Genesis creation narratives alongside mainstream Christian responses that accept evolutionary science; a Hindu perspective might show how cyclical cosmologies reframe questions about beginnings; a Buddhist approach might shift the focus from a creator to the conditions that perpetuate suffering, influencing how one treats the problem of evil. Use such examples to show command of the world religion element of the course and to illustrate variety rather than treating religious tradition as monolithic.

## Teaching and learning priorities
When preparing for this topic in the classroom, prioritise developing students’ abilities to explain positions accurately before critiquing them. Encourage practice in distinguishing analysis (explaining why a view holds and how it works) from evaluation (assessing strengths, weaknesses and implications). Use source materials — scriptural extracts, summaries of scientific theories and philosophical passages — to practise interpretation and contextualisation. Case studies and contemporary examples (such as debates over stem‑cell research when discussing beginnings of life, or media reports of alleged miracles) make abstract arguments concrete and test students’ ability to apply theory to real situations. Finally, scaffold extended writing by modelling paragraph structures that move from knowledge to analysis to evaluation and a short concluding judgement.

## Exam technique
Plan each answer so it has a clear introduction, a sustained middle and a concise conclusion. Begin by defining key terms and stating which perspective or tradition you are using; this immediately situates your response and shows command of the question. In the body, explain religious and non‑religious positions with specific content from the world religion you have studied and from relevant philosophical arguments. When analysing, move beyond description: explain reasons, consequences and internal logic. When evaluating, weigh strengths and weaknesses, challenge assumptions and consider counterarguments. Use named thinkers and clearly labelled theodicies, arguments or scientific ideas to show precision, but do so sparingly and only where it clarifies your point. For 20‑mark questions allocate time roughly in thirds: one third for explanation and analysis, one third for evaluation, and the final third to produce a structured conclusion that answers the question directly. For shorter 10‑mark questions focus tightly on explanation and one clear evaluative point. In assignments, choose questions that let you deploy familiar material in depth and gather a range of sources; keep the resource sheet concise and clearly state your question. Throughout, aim to balance fairness to both sides of an argument, support judgments with reasons or evidence, and finish with a reasoned conclusion that shows the examiner you can synthesise the material rather than merely listing viewpoints.
