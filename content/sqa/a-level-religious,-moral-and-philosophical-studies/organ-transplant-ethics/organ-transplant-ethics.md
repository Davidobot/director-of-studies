# Medical ethics: organ transplant ethics (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction and ethical landscape
Organ transplantation is one of the most striking achievements of modern medicine, saving and transforming lives. At the same time it raises sharply contested ethical, legal and religious questions. Students studying organ transplant ethics should be able to explain how organs are sourced and allocated, to analyse competing moral principles such as respect for persons, beneficence, justice and non-maleficence, and to evaluate religious and non-religious responses. The key ethical tensions arise from scarcity, consent, the definition of death, the status of the body, and social inequalities that shape who gives and who receives. These tensions produce practical dilemmas: should families be able to override a deceased person’s prior decision to donate, can organs be bought and sold, how should a life-saving transplant be allocated between two candidates, and what are the implications of new technologies such as xenotransplantation and synthetic organs? A careful revision approach draws together factual knowledge about law and practice, philosophical argument, and case-based moral reasoning.

## Organ procurement: consent systems and practical practice
How organs are obtained determines much of the ethical debate. Two broad categories of consent systems exist: explicit consent, often called opt-in, where individuals record a decision to donate, and presumed consent, or opt-out, where donation is the default unless an individual has registered an objection. Many jurisdictions use a “soft opt-out” model: the law presumes consent but medical teams still consult families and may not proceed against family wishes. In the UK context Wales introduced an opt-out system in the 2010s and similar reforms were later adopted in other nations of the UK; however, practice still involves family consultation. Legal frameworks also differ: England, Wales and Northern Ireland are governed by the Human Tissue Act 2004, while Scotland has its own Human Tissue legislation. Beyond legal forms of consent, practical concerns include how well the public is informed about the system, how registries are maintained, and how vulnerable groups are treated. Genuine consent requires clear, voluntary knowledge; presumed consent shifts the moral burden onto citizens to register dissent and raises questions about public awareness and the adequacy of safeguards.

## Sources of organs: living donors, deceased donors and new technologies
Organs for transplantation come from living donors and deceased donors. Living donation most commonly supplies kidneys and segments of the liver; it raises issues about risk to a healthy person, the ethics of altruistic donation, and the permissibility of donation between relatives or strangers. Paired kidney exchanges permit two incompatible donor-recipient pairs to swap to achieve matches, presenting a creative solution that is ethically well regarded when it respects voluntary informed consent. Deceased donation typically follows either brainstem (brain) death or circulatory death criteria, with distinctions between heart-beating and non-heart-beating donors. New technological developments expand possibilities and ethical complexities. Xenotransplantation, especially using genetically modified pig organs, has moved from the laboratory to high-profile clinical cases in recent years, provoking questions about zoonotic risk, animal welfare, and long-term outcomes. Advances in tissue engineering and synthetic organs promise to reduce scarcity but also raise questions about access, cost and whether artificially created organs change moral status debates. Each source of organs requires careful balancing of benefits, harms and respect for persons.

## Determining death and the dead donor rule
A central ethical and clinical requirement in transplantation is the “dead donor rule”: organs may not be taken from a living person if the act of removal causes death. This principle relies on a clear, ethically defensible definition of death. Modern practice generally recognises two accepted criteria: brainstem (or whole brain) death and circulatory death. Brainstem death is diagnosed when irreversible loss of brainstem function is established and the patient can no longer breathe or sustain consciousness; in such cases life-sustaining technologies may keep the heart beating, enabling organ perfusion for transplantation. Donation after circulatory death is used where circulatory function has irreversibly ceased. Philosophical controversies persist. Some critics dispute the coherence of brain death as equivalent to death of the organism, pointing to biological continuity, while others defend brain death as the relevant standard because it marks irreversible loss of the integrated functioning that makes a human organism a person. These debates matter because they touch on respect for the donor’s bodily integrity and the public trust that donation procedures do not cause death.

## Allocation of organs: justice, utility and competing principles
Because organs are scarce, allocation requires ethically defensible rules. Different principles pull in different directions. A utilitarian approach favours allocation that maximises overall benefit: organs go where they will produce the greatest net years of life saved or best quality-adjusted outcomes. A need- or urgency-based approach prioritises the sickest patients who will die soon without a transplant. Egalitarian theories stress equal access and fair chances, sometimes operationalised via waiting-time or lottery mechanisms. Other considerations include likelihood of success, age, lifestyle factors that contribute to disease, and social worth, the latter of which is highly controversial. Real-world allocation systems are mixed: many transplant units balance urgency and prognosis, often guided by national bodies that publish ethical principles to ensure transparency. Ethical questions arise when socioeconomic status, geography, or ability to pay influence access; international organ markets and transplant tourism amplify concerns about exploitation and injustice. Good answers will show awareness that allocation systems embody moral trade-offs and require public justification to maintain legitimacy.

## Religious and philosophical responses
Religious responses to organ transplantation are diverse but often supportive in principle. Many Christian denominations, including the Roman Catholic Church, describe organ donation as an act of charity and solidarity, while cautioning against the commodification of the body and insisting on consent. Jewish thought broadly supports donation under the principle of saving life (pikuach nefesh), though there is debate about the definition of death. Islamic scholars have reached varying conclusions but many permit organ donation when it saves life and honor the dignity of the donor, again with conditions about consent and dignity. Non-religious philosophical positions also offer robust engagement. Utilitarian arguments emphasise saving lives and relieving suffering, thus often supporting donation and wide allocation aimed at maximizing benefit. Deontological perspectives highlight respect for persons and informed consent; Kantian critics might object to any practice that treats the body as a mere means to another’s ends, while ways to reconcile deontology with donation stress autonomous consent as morally decisive. Virtue ethics reframes questions in terms of character: donation is praiseworthy if motivated by generosity and solidarity, while selling organs may be vices of exploitation. Students should be prepared to contrast religious and secular reasoning and to show how each frames the moral priorities differently.

## Ethical objections: commercialization, coercion and inequality
Arguments against commodifying human organs form a persistent strand of criticism. Critics argue that permitting the sale of organs treats bodies, or body parts, as commodities and risks exploiting impoverished sellers who may accept dangerous procedures out of economic desperation. Empirical evidence of black markets and organ trafficking supports these concerns. Defenders of regulated markets reply that a safe, tightly regulated system could reduce harm and increase supply, but significant moral and practical objections remain concerning coercion, consent quality, and fairness. Other ethical problems include family pressure to donate, insufficient information for truly informed consent, and the influence of structural inequalities where those in wealthier regions access transplants more readily than those in poorer areas. Public trust is fragile: scandals or perceptions of unjust allocation can reduce donation rates. Ethical policy-making therefore must consider both principle and consequences; it must protect autonomy and vulnerable people while striving to reduce preventable deaths from organ shortages.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on organ transplant ethics, begin by carefully identifying the task: whether it asks you to describe, analyse or evaluate. For knowledge questions, give a clear definition or explanation and exemplify it briefly with a real-world case, such as living kidney donation or the adoption of opt-out consent in parts of the UK. For analysis, break down the position into its claims and assumptions and explore implications; for example, analysing presumed consent requires examining assumptions about public awareness and the moral weight of silence. For evaluation, always present both supporting and critical arguments and consider strengths and weaknesses; use ethical theories explicitly—utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics—to structure your reasoning, and show how religious perspectives either support or challenge secular ones. Make use of case studies and current examples to demonstrate relevance, but avoid overreliance on anecdote. Plan your essay briefly before writing so your argument flows: introduce the issue with precise terminology, set out the relevant principles, analyse contrasting positions with illustrative examples, and conclude with a reasoned judgement that recognises residual uncertainties. In shorter source-based questions, match the mark command: five-mark knowledge answers should be concise and factual, five-mark analysis answers should make connections and explain implications, and five-mark evaluation answers should make a supported judgement with at least one counterpoint. Throughout, cite relevant legal or institutional features where helpful (for example, the distinction between organ consent regimes), explain technical terms such as “brainstem death” and “dead donor rule”, and keep language clear and tightly focused to demonstrate both subject knowledge and critical thinking.
