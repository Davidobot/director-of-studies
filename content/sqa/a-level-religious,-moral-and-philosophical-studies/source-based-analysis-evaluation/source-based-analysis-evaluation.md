# Source-based skills: analysing and evaluating unseen sources (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What are unseen source questions?
Unseen source questions are short, previously unseen extracts or quotations that appear in the question paper and invite you to apply the knowledge and skills you have developed across the course. In Advanced Higher RMPS each section of the question paper includes a source and three linked questions: one testing knowledge and understanding, one testing analysis, and one testing evaluation. Each of these source questions is worth five marks, so responses must be concise, focused and closely tied to the extract. The sources are usually brief and typically link to material that is not the focus of the essay options, so they test your ability to recognise relevant concepts, make connections, and judge the strength of an argument quickly and accurately.

## Reading the source: first steps
Begin by reading the source slowly and then read it a second time with a pencil or mental marker. Identify the central claim or assertion and notice key words that point to particular topics or concepts from the course—terms such as contingent, necessary, design, numinous, sanctity, conversion, causation, or assisted dying will immediately suggest the area of study. Ask yourself what standpoint the writer has: is it philosophical, scientific, religious, or descriptive? Consider what is being assumed rather than stated. Many sources will rely on an implicit premise (for example, that every event must have a cause) that you can challenge or support. Quickly note any obvious links to thinkers you know—Aquinas, Paley, Hume, James, Otto, Swinburne, or modern writers such as William Lane Craig—because naming relevant figures and ideas often earns marks for knowledge and shows clarity of thought.

## The three question types: what examiners expect
Knowledge and understanding questions require a brief, accurate description in your own words of the issue or perspective presented by the source. Your aim is to show that you can identify and explain the idea concisely. For example, if the source paraphrases David Hume’s criticism of the cosmological argument, a strong five-mark answer would define the cosmological argument as an a posteriori case for a necessary first cause and then summarise Hume’s challenge that the move from individual causes to a cause of the universe is not automatically justified.

Analysis questions ask you to break the source down and make connections with the wider area of study. Rather than simply repeating the source, you should explain implications, underlying assumptions and likely consequences of the position. Using the Hume example, an analytical response would point out that Hume is contesting the move from contingent parts to a necessary whole, noting parallels with Russell’s “human race has no mother” counter-analogy, and explaining how such a criticism undermines the need for a first cause.

Evaluation questions demand a short, reasoned judgement about the strength or weakness of the source’s position. You should weigh supporting and opposing reasons, consider alternative accounts, and reach a balanced conclusion. With the same Hume source, evaluation could acknowledge the force of modern quantum indeterminacy as support for Hume’s scepticism while also arguing that the intelligibility of the universe still invites explanations such as Copleston’s defence of a necessary explanation. The strongest evaluations do not simply assert agreement or disagreement; they explain why and show awareness of limits to the critique.

## Applying course knowledge to unseen material
Sources are short, but your responses should draw on the range of course knowledge you have so that your answers sit firmly within the appropriate intellectual context. For philosophy of religion sources you should be prepared to use technical vocabulary such as a posteriori, contingent/necessary being, teleological analogy, fine-tuning, inference to the best explanation, or the attributes of classical theism. For medical ethics sources, precise terms like sanctity of life, proportionality, voluntary/non-voluntary euthanasia, organ procurement, and beginning-of-life interventions will be useful. For religious experience, concepts such as the numinous, conversion types, mystical versus meditative experience, and psychological or neuroscientific explanations will allow you to place the source within debates. Naming relevant thinkers or positions and briefly showing how the source fits among their views gives weight to your answers. For instance, if the source mentions apparent order in nature, linking it to Paley’s watch analogy and then noting Darwinian responses or the modern fine-tuning debate demonstrates both knowledge and the ability to situate the extract within competing explanations.

## Developing strong analysis and evaluation
Good analysis teases out assumptions and consequences. When a source asserts something, ask what would follow if that claim were true and whether there are unstated presuppositions that must also hold. In evaluating, use criteria: coherence, evidential support, explanatory power, consistency with other accepted facts, and practical implications. Consider alternative accounts and their relative strengths. For example, when confronted with a source that treats religious experience as direct evidence of the divine, you can analyse the epistemic claim—does a reported experience provide prima facie justification for belief?—and evaluate by comparing the theistic account with psychological, neurological, and sociological explanations. When weighing positions, avoid simplistic refutation; instead, balance the merits of each side and show why one line of response might be more plausible in the given context. Clarify when a criticism is conclusive and when it merely raises doubt. Use short illustrative examples where helpful, such as a modern neurology study that complicates claims of unmediated divine perception or a legal distinction in assisted dying that changes moral evaluation.

## Writing and structuring answers under exam conditions
Because each source question is worth only five marks, plan responses that are focused and economical. Start knowledge answers with a clear defining sentence, follow with one or two clarifying sentences, and finish with a brief linking phrase showing relevance. For analysis questions open by stating what the source is doing, then explain two connected implications or assumptions, using a named idea or thinker where possible. For evaluation questions briefly state your judgement, outline a supporting reason, then present a significant objection and conclude by weighing both to reach a qualified verdict. Use terms such as “this implies”, “this assumes”, “however”, and “therefore” to signpost your reasoning. Avoid long quotations from the source; instead paraphrase concisely and show you can interpret. Accurate terminology and naming thinkers or positions will score well, but never sacrifice clarity for jargon. Keep sentences precise and polished: examiners reward coherent, compact arguments that show command of the material.

## Preparing in the course: practice and wider reading
The best preparation is deliberate practice with unseen sources and active engagement with primary and secondary materials. Regularly practise with short extracts and time yourself to compose 90–120 second responses for five-mark questions. Read a range of thinkers from different perspectives so that you can quickly recognise which debates a source relates to and recall arguments and counter-arguments. Practice tasks that require you to move from description to analysis to evaluation quickly, and ask teachers or peers to give feedback on clarity and balance. In your wider reading pay attention to how philosophers, theologians and scientists frame evidence and to the kinds of assumptions their arguments rest on. Keep a notebook of succinct summaries of central arguments, typical counter-arguments, and key vocabulary so that you can revise quickly and deploy these elements under timed conditions.

## Exam technique
Time management and precision are central to success in unseen source questions. Read the source carefully twice and note the central claim and its key terms. For a knowledge question, strive for two to three clear sentences that define the idea and place it in context. For analysis, write three to four concise sentences that identify assumptions and explain implications, ideally linking to a named thinker or related argument. For evaluation, give a short verdict, support it with a clear reason, introduce a credible counterpoint, and finish with a balanced conclusion; aim for four to six tight sentences. Use subject-specific vocabulary accurately, but prioritise clarity. Signpost your argument so the examiner can follow your reasoning quickly. Avoid repeating the source verbatim; paraphrase and show interpretation. If you are unsure which area a source belongs to, choose the most plausible link and proceed confidently, making explicit any interpretative choices you make. Finally, practise under timed conditions, review model answers to learn strong phrasing, and treat every unseen-source practice as an opportunity to sharpen the skill of moving from textual understanding to careful judgement.
