# Morality and justice: causes of crime and punishment (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: framing morality, justice and responses to crime
Understanding crime, its causes and the ways societies respond to it sits at the heart of moral and political thought. For students of Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies it is important to move beyond common-sense ideas and to analyse both why people offend and what justice should demand in response. This topic asks you to combine careful factual knowledge about causes of crime with ethical analysis of punishment: what are its purposes, how should it be carried out, and which religious and non-religious arguments support or challenge different approaches. Throughout your revision keep in mind the distinction between description (what happens), analysis (why it happens, how a theory explains it) and evaluation (how convincing or desirable those explanations and responses are).

## Causes of crime — environmental influences
Environmental explanations focus on the social, economic and cultural contexts that shape behaviour. Poverty, unemployment and social exclusion can create pressures that increase the likelihood of criminal activity, either through desperation or through the normalisation of illegal means to meet basic needs. Family background matters too: children raised in unstable homes, exposed to violence, neglect or inconsistent discipline are statistically at greater risk of offending. Education and school experience are crucial; poor attainment, truancy and school exclusion disrupt socialisation and limit legitimate opportunities. The neighbourhood and peer group are also powerful influences. Areas with weak community cohesion, high drug markets or gang activity offer both the opportunity and social reinforcement for crime. Cultural factors, such as attitudes that glorify violence or dishonourability, further shape choices. When assessing environmental explanations, consider how structural forces interact with individual agency: they help explain patterns and concentrations of crime but do not mean every person in a poor area will offend. This leads to questions about responsibility and appropriate social responses, such as investment in education, poverty alleviation and community policing.

## Causes of crime — psychological factors
Psychological approaches look inside the individual to explain offending. Developmental psychology highlights how early childhood experiences shape personality and impulse control. Attachment problems, exposure to trauma and inadequate parental supervision can impair moral development. Cognitive explanations point to distortions in thinking: offenders may justify harmful acts, minimise harm to victims, or possess impaired moral reasoning that fails to see long-term consequences. Personality traits such as impulsivity, low empathy and aggressiveness are correlated with certain types of crime. Mental illness is another factor; untreated psychiatric conditions can contribute to offending, especially where support services are lacking. Psychological theories include learning models too: social learning theory argues that behaviour is learned by imitation and reinforcement, so if criminal behaviour is rewarded in an individual's social environment it becomes more likely. When evaluating psychological explanations ask how they account for social context, how far they imply diminished moral responsibility, and what they suggest about punishment — whether the emphasis should be on treatment and rehabilitation rather than retribution.

## Purposes of punishment: retribution, deterrence, protection and reformation
Philosophical and religious traditions vary in what they consider the proper purpose of punishment. Retribution treats punishment as morally required because a wrongdoer deserves to suffer proportionally for the harm caused. It appeals to notions of moral balance and respect for persons as moral agents: because the offender chose to do wrong, they must receive their just deserts. Deterrence aims to reduce crime by making the costs of offending outweigh any perceived benefits, either through specific deterrence (preventing an individual from reoffending) or general deterrence (discouraging the wider public). Protection focuses on public safety and incapacitation: removing dangerous individuals from society to prevent further harm. Reformation (or rehabilitation) looks forward rather than backward, aiming to change offenders’ behaviour and attitudes so they can return to society as law-abiding citizens. Each purpose has strengths and weaknesses. Retribution can satisfy a sense of moral justice but risks cruelty if taken too far. Deterrence depends on the rational calculation of offenders and may be less effective where offending is impulsive or driven by addiction. Protection can be necessary for public safety but raises ethical questions about indefinite detention. Reformation fits well with restorative aims and many religious teachings but requires resources and long-term commitment.

## Responses to crime: custodial and non-custodial sentences, and capital punishment
Societies use a range of sanctions to achieve the purposes above. Custodial sentences, such as imprisonment, aim primarily at protection and, to varying degrees, deterrence and retribution. Prisons can incapacitate offenders and serve as a visible punishment, but they are costly and, without effective rehabilitation, may increase the risk of reoffending. Non-custodial sentences include fines, community service, probation and restorative justice practices. These options can better promote rehabilitation, keep offenders integrated in family and work life, and reduce the social harms of imprisonment, especially for low-level and first-time offenders. Restorative justice deserves emphasis as a distinct approach: it seeks to repair harm by bringing victims and offenders into dialogue, encouraging accountability, apology and concrete reparation. Capital punishment — the state-sanctioned taking of life — remains a contentious response. Although abolished in the UK, it is still practised in some countries and therefore must be addressed philosophically. Advocates argue it serves retribution and deterrence for the most serious crimes; opponents raise moral objections about the sanctity of life, the risk of wrongful execution, the lack of conclusive evidence for deterrence, and the irreversibility of the penalty. When evaluating responses, consider effectiveness, proportionality, human rights, the potential for discrimination, and opportunities for restorative practices.

## Religious and non-religious perspectives on crime and punishment
Religious traditions offer distinctive resources for thinking about crime and punishment, often mixing concern for justice with calls for mercy and transformation. Within Christianity, themes of sin, repentance and forgiveness coexist with calls for justice and protection of the innocent; many Christian thinkers support rehabilitation and restorative practices that mirror the Gospel’s emphasis on reconciliation, though some readings of scripture can be invoked to support retributive measures. In Islam, the objectives of Sharia include protection of life, property and community; punishments are framed within strict evidential requirements, and there is space for mercy and repentance. Buddhism interprets wrongdoing through the lens of kamma (karma) and moral causation, which tends to emphasise rehabilitation and moral education rather than vindictive punishment. Judaism stresses teshuva (repentance), communal responsibility and repair of harm; certain biblical texts show retributive responses historically, but rabbinic tradition places strong emphasis on proportionality and restoration. Hindu ideas of dharma and karma shape understandings of moral consequence, yet social and legal traditions within Hindu societies have also supported a range of sanctions. Sikhism values justice and equality, urging both the protection of the community and the transformation of the individual. Non-religious ethical frameworks add further perspectives. Utilitarianism judges punishment by consequences: the best punishment is that which maximises overall wellbeing, so rehabilitation and deterrence may be favoured if they reduce harm. Kantian deontology defends retribution as an expression of respect for persons: to punish a wrongdoer is to treat them as morally responsible agents who must face the consequences of their choices. Contemporary human rights frameworks influence many modern debates, stressing dignity, proportionality and the abolition of cruel or inhuman punishment. Teaching these views well means showing how each tradition balances competing aims and how particular doctrines translate into policy positions on issues such as juvenile justice, treatment of mentally ill offenders and the death penalty.

## Evaluation and contemporary issues: effectiveness, fairness and reform
A strong revision response needs to weigh theory against evidence and contemporary realities. For instance, does imprisonment actually deter crime, or does it exacerbate recidivism by damaging employment prospects and social bonds? Do harsh sentences reduce offending, or do social investments in housing, education and mental health produce better long-term outcomes? Consider equality and discrimination: criminal justice systems can reflect and reproduce social biases, so ethical assessment must ask whether punishments are administered fairly across class, race and gender. Juvenile offenders raise special ethical problems because their moral agency and maturity are still developing; many argue that reformation and diversion are ethically preferable in these cases. Mental illness and addiction complicate notions of moral responsibility and suggest a stronger role for treatment-focused responses. Restorative justice and community-based programmes show promising results in some contexts by centring victims’ needs and encouraging offender accountability without the harms of incarceration. International debates about capital punishment, life imprisonment without parole and indeterminate detention touch on human rights conventions and shifting public attitudes. Good evaluation in exam answers links philosophical aims to empirical outcomes and draws careful, nuanced conclusions: a persuasive position will normally combine principled arguments with attention to practical effects and moral constraints.

## Teaching and revision approaches
When preparing to teach or revise this topic, combine conceptual clarity with case studies and contemporary examples. Begin by ensuring students can define key terms — crime, culpability, punishment, deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation — and distinguish aims of punishment. Use real-world examples such as restorative justice programmes, well-documented reform initiatives, or high-profile debates about capital punishment to bring abstract ideas to life. Encourage students to apply religious teachings to practical cases: how would a Christian, Muslim or Buddhist response shape sentencing or rehabilitation for an offender who stole to feed a family? Ask students to compare utilitarian and deontological responses to the same scenario. Practice past paper questions under timed conditions and emphasise the skills of analysis (explaining causes and mechanisms), evaluation (weighing strengths and weaknesses), and synthesis (drawing a balanced conclusion that integrates religious and non-religious perspectives). Use role-play or structured debates to develop empathy and moral imagination, and set research tasks that require students to find evidence about recidivism rates, the impacts of community sentences, or results from restorative justice schemes so that their evaluations are empirically informed.

## Exam technique
To earn top marks, structure answers clearly and show both detailed knowledge and critical thinking. Begin by defining key terms briefly and stating the issue you will address. For a 10-mark question focus on clear exposition and analysis: give a concise explanation of causes or purposes, support your points with examples or reference to religious and secular views, and include one or two evaluative comments. For a 20-mark question plan a short introduction, two or three development paragraphs that analyse different aspects (for example, environmental causes, psychological causes, and religious responses), and a concluding paragraph that weighs the arguments and reaches a reasoned judgement. Use religious teachings and non-religious theories as evidence: explain how they support different aims of punishment and how they apply to real cases. When evaluating, do more than list pros and cons; explain why each point matters and link it back to the central question of justice. Balance principles (for example, dignity or deservedness) with practical considerations (effectiveness, costs, fairness). Manage time by allocating roughly a third of your time to planning and the rest to writing and final checking. Finally, practise writing within exam conditions so your explanations are clear, your evaluation is supported, and your conclusion shows a thoughtful synthesis rather than an unsupported assertion.
