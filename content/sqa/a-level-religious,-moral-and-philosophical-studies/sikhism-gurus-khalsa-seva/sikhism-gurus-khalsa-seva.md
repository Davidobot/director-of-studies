# Sikhism: Gurus, Khalsa and seva (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: scope and significance
Sikhism is a monotheistic, reforming religion founded in the late 15th century in the Punjab by Guru Nanak and developed by a succession of ten human Gurus. Central to Sikh thought and practice are the teachings of the Gurus, the institutional and ethical role of the Khalsa created at the end of the Guru period, and the ethic of seva — selfless service — which expresses Sikh commitments in the community. For Higher RMPS it is important to understand the historical development of these ideas, how beliefs and practices relate to one another, and how they shape Sikh identity and moral responses in both past and contemporary contexts.

## The Gurus and the authority of the Guru
The line of ten human Gurus begins with Guru Nanak (1469–1539) and ends with Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708). The Gurus were not only spiritual teachers; they created institutions, composed scripture, and shaped communal life. Guru Arjan (the fifth Guru) compiled much of the scripture that became the Guru Granth Sahib and established the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar. In 1708 Guru Gobind Singh formally ended the line of human Gurus by declaring the Guru Granth Sahib — the sacred scripture — as the eternal, living Guru. This transfer of Guruship is distinctive: authority rests both in the teachings preserved in scripture and in the communal practices authorised by the Gurus. When answering questions on the Gurus, make clear the dual nature of authority — historical personhood and the continuing spiritual authority of the Guru Granth Sahib — and give examples such as the installation of the Guru Granth Sahib as the perpetual guide for Sikhs.

## The Khalsa: history, identity and purpose
The Khalsa was created by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 during a ceremony at Anandpur Sahib. It established a collective of initiated Sikhs committed to discipline, martial readiness and moral living. The initiation (Amrit Sanskar) involves taking Amrit (sugared water stirred with a double-edged sword) and vows to follow the Khalsa code. The Khalsa is commonly associated with the five K’s — kes (uncut hair), kanga (comb), kara (steel bracelet), kachera (specific undergarment), and kirpan (short sword) — which function as visible marks of identity and as reminders of moral duties. The Khalsa embodied the idea of sant-sipahi, the saint-soldier, combining spiritual devotion with readiness to protect justice and oppose oppression. In exam answers, connect the formation of the Khalsa to historical pressures such as Mughal persecution and to theological themes like the defence of righteousness, and note diversity within Sikhism between Amritdhari (initiated) Sikhs and Sahajdhari or non-initiated communities.

## Key theological concepts linked to Gurus and Khalsa
Sikh theology contains a number of concepts that explain human condition and the goal of life, and these directly inform practices associated with the Gurus and the Khalsa. Sikhs affirm one formless God (Ik Onkar) who is both transcendent and immanent. The human self (atma) possesses free will, and actions have moral consequences (karma). Maya denotes the illusory nature of worldly attachments, while haumai — often translated as ego or self-centeredness — is the root of moral error. The Five Evils (kam, krodh, lobh, moh, ahankar — lust, anger, greed, attachment, pride) are tendencies to be overcome. A Gurmukh is someone who turns towards the Guru’s teaching and lives in harmony with God; a manmukh is self-willed and led by ego. The ideal of Jivan Mukti — liberation while alive — means that through inner transformation and right living a Sikh can experience spiritual freedom in this life. When writing about these beliefs, show how they lead naturally to community practices: overcoming haumai by serving others, and pursuing simran and kirt to cultivate God-consciousness.

## Seva, simran and kirt: practice and worship
Seva (selfless service), simran (remembrance of God, often through repetition of God’s name), and kirt (devotional singing of scripture) are core practices. Seva takes many forms: physical work in the gurdwara such as preparing and serving langar (the free communal meal), cleaning, or providing logistical support; material donations; and social action such as relief work. These acts are not simply charitable in a secular sense but are religious disciplines that reduce pride, break down caste and status distinctions, and help the practitioner overcome haumai. Simran and kirt provide the spiritual means by which attachment and ego are transformed: reciting the name of God or singing verses from the Guru Granth Sahib builds concentration and devotion that lead toward Gurmukh consciousness. Explain in answers that worship in Sikhism is both devotional and practical: kirt and simran sustain the inner life, while seva enacts the outer ethics of equality and compassion. Concrete classroom examples include the operation of langar at every gurdwara and the worldwide Sikh tradition of volunteering in disaster relief.

## Social and ethical implications: equality, langar and contemporary applications
Sikh teachings on equality and community have immediate social implications. From the start Guru Nanak rejected caste hierarchy and asserted the equal worth of all human beings, including women. These principles are practised in the langar where everyone sits together regardless of background, and in the historic abolition of practices that discriminated by birth. The Khalsa’s insistence on moral courage and defence of the oppressed has ethical consequences when considering issues such as just resistance versus violence; the sanctity of life and the duty to protect the vulnerable are themes for evaluation. Modern examples of Sikh communal ethic include mass volunteerism, food distribution during crises and interfaith outreach; these show how traditional ideals of seva and vand chakkana — sharing one’s earnings — operate in contemporary society. When tackling evaluative questions, consider both strengths (clear, action-oriented ethical commitments; strong sense of community) and criticisms or tensions (how martial identity is interpreted, diversity of observance, and challenges of maintaining distinct religious identity in modern secular contexts such as employment or education).

## Diversity of practice and sources of authority
While the Gurus and Guru Granth Sahib provide coherent direction, Sikhism is not monolithic. There is variation between traditions and levels of observance: Amritdhari Sikhs follow the full Khalsa discipline, while Sahajdhari Sikhs may follow teachings without full initiation. Historical schisms and local practices have produced differing emphases in ritual and social life. The primary source remains the Guru Granth Sahib, which includes hymns of Sikh Gurus and selected bhakti and Sufi poets; other sources include hukamnamas (edict letters) and the Rehat Maryada (code of conduct), which is a contemporary attempt to standardise practice. In exam answers, show awareness of intra-religious diversity and avoid over-generalisation; when using sources, reference the Guru Granth Sahib and historical acts such as Guru Gobind Singh’s founding of the Khalsa and the installation of scripture as Guru.

## Exam technique
When answering Higher RMPS questions on Sikhism, structure is as important as content. For short questions, begin with a clear definition of terms such as Khalsa, seva, simran, haumai or Jivan Mukti. For 10-mark application/analysis questions, present focused knowledge linked to explanation: outline the belief or practice, explain its religious meaning, and give an example (for instance, explain how langar expresses equality and provide a brief example of a modern langar during a crisis). For 20-mark questions, adopt a two-part approach: first develop detailed knowledge and analysis (AO1/AO2), then present balanced evaluation that weighs strengths and weaknesses and reaches a reasoned conclusion. Use the “claim, explain, exemplify, evaluate” rhythm: make a claim about a belief or practice, explain its basis in the Gurus’ teaching or in the Guru Granth Sahib, give an illustrative example or historical context, and evaluate alternatives or tensions. Always answer the specific question asked; if it requests religious and non-religious perspectives, include both and compare them. To score highly, demonstrate understanding of links between belief and practice (for example, show how overcoming haumai through simran and seva leads to the ideal of Jivan Mukti), refer to authoritative sources or historical events where relevant, and show awareness of diversity within Sikhism. Conclude with a clear, justified judgement that synthesises the material. Time management is crucial: for a two-hour paper allocate time proportionally, leave time to plan and proofread longer answers, and use short quotations or named sources sparingly to support points rather than substitute for argument.
