# Religious experience: key theories (James, Otto, Swinburne) (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: what we mean by religious experience
Religious experience is the name given to episodes in which individuals claim contact with, awareness of, or transformation by a divine, transcendent or numinous reality. These episodes vary dramatically in form and intensity: some are dramatic conversions, others are quiet moments of mystical union, while still others are sensory events claimed as miracles. In the study of religious experience three thinkers stand out for providing systematic ways to understand what these episodes are and what they mean for religious belief. William James approached religious experience as a psychological and pragmatic phenomenon whose value should be judged by its effects. Rudolf Otto focused on the distinctive non-rational quality of encounters with the “wholly other,” introducing the idea of the numinous. Richard Swinburne later developed an analytic and evidential account, treating experiences as prima facie evidence for the existence of God unless good defeaters are produced. Understanding their theories helps students explore whether religious experiences are evidence for God, how they should be interpreted, and how to weigh alternative explanations.

## William James: varieties, marks, and pragmatism
William James, writing at the turn of the twentieth century, collected and analysed many accounts of religious experience and set out two linked contributions: a typology of experiences and a set of characteristics common to mystical states. His typology includes conversion experiences, which may be sudden and life-changing as in Paul’s Damascus road or gradual as in intellectual and moral conversions; mystical experiences, which he subdivided into passive and active, involuntary and voluntary; and the states associated with saintliness and “healthy-minded” or “sick-souled” religious temperaments. James is best known for four marks he considered typical of mysticism: ineffability (the experience cannot be adequately expressed in ordinary language), noetic quality (the experience conveys a form of insight or knowledge), transiency (the state tends to be short-lived), and passivity (the experiencer feels controlled by something outside themselves). Crucially, James was interested in the practical consequences of such experiences. He argued that their psychological fruits—changes in behaviour, increased moral strength, reconciling of doubts—count in favour of their genuineness. His method is empirical and psychological rather than metaphysical: religious experience is studied from the inside and judged, at least in part, by what it produces in a person’s life. For teaching, it helps to contrast James’s sympathetic but cautious stance with more sceptical and more metaphysically assertive positions, and to use case studies (for example, St. Augustine’s gradual conversion or modern testimonies of recovery after conversion) to show how James links experience with behavioural change.

## Rudolf Otto: the numinous and the “wholly other”
Rudolf Otto sought to capture what he took to be the uniquely religious element of experience: an encounter with the numinous. For Otto the numinous is a sui generis, non-rational feeling, neither ethical nor aesthetic, which he describes with the Latin phrase mysterium tremendum et fascinans. This expression combines two sides: the tremendum, an overwhelming sense of awe, terror and smallness before the divine; and the fascinans, an attraction that draws the person toward the divine despite the fear. Otto insisted that this reaction is not reducible to ordinary feelings or to reasoned proof; it has its own quality and demands a different kind of attention. In teaching Otto, it is helpful to emphasise that he is trying to account for the emotive core of many religious traditions: the profound awe people report at sacred places, at rites, or in moments of encounter. Otto’s approach supports the claim that religious experience points beyond human categories to something “wholly other.” Critics often press Otto on whether his description inadvertently reinterprets natural phenomena as divine feelings or whether cultural conditioning accounts for the form of the numinous. Nonetheless, Otto remains useful for explaining why some religious experiences resist purely psychological or sociological explanations: they are characterised by a depth of feeling that many practitioners treat as convincing evidence of the divine presence.

## Richard Swinburne: testimony, credulity, and epistemic justification
Richard Swinburne brings analytic philosophy to the debate, arguing that religious experiences can be treated much like sense experiences and so can provide prima facie justification for belief in God. Swinburne distinguishes between public experiences, which others can witness, and private experiences, known only to the individual. His two central epistemic principles are the principle of credulity and the principle of testimony. The principle of credulity says that, if it seems to someone that X is present, then, barring counter-evidence, they are prima facie justified in believing that X is present. The principle of testimony says that we should generally trust others’ testimony about their experiences unless we have reason to doubt their reliability. Applying these principles, Swinburne argues that a sincere report of experiencing God is, at first instance, evidence for God’s presence unless there are defeaters such as evidence of hysteria, drugs, mental disorder, or strong competing explanations. Swinburne’s method makes religious experience part of a cumulative case for theism: individual experiences add probabilistically to the overall justification for belief in God. Teaching Swinburne is an opportunity to explore how analytic tools treat religious claims as evidence and to introduce students to debates about defeaters, probability, and testimony. It also opens up discussion about cross-cultural conflicts of testimony—how rival religious claims from different traditions affect the epistemic force of any single testimony.

## Types and examples of religious experience in practice
Religious experiences appear in many forms, and understanding these helps make abstract theories concrete. Mystical experiences may be sudden and ineffable, as in some accounts of union with God reported by Teresa of Avila, or gradual and cultivated through meditation in Buddhist traditions. Conversion experiences are often illustrated by Paul’s sudden transformation on the road to Damascus, but many conversions are slower moral re-orientations. Miracles and sensory experiences—such as claims of visions, healings at Lourdes, or the events reported during the Toronto Blessing—are presented by some as communal or public evidence of the divine, while near-death experiences produce accounts of light, peace and encounters with deceased relatives that many interpret religiously. Meditative experiences and the sense of a personal relationship with God occur across traditions, whether in Christian prayer, Sufi ecstasy, or Hindu samadhi. When teaching these examples, it is important to distinguish private experiences, accessible only to the subject, from public phenomena that multiple witnesses can attest. Case studies make the theories of James, Otto and Swinburne come alive: James’s emphasis on the moral fruit of a conversion, Otto’s description of awe before the wholly other, and Swinburne’s appeal to testimony all find direct application to concrete testimonies.

## Alternative accounts and critical responses
A range of non-religious explanations competes with the straightforward theistic reading of religious experience. Psychological accounts beginning with Freud explain religious feeling as wish-fulfilment or as projections of infantile longings, while Jung interprets certain experiences through archetypes and the collective unconscious. Neuroscience offers another line of critique: studies that link religious experiences to brain states or that simulate aspects of mystical states (for example, experiments with transcranial stimulation) suggest that such experiences may have natural correlates. Sociological approaches, from Marx’s view of religion as the “opiate of the masses” to Durkheim’s account of the role of collective rituals in creating sacred meaning, argue that social and cultural contexts shape how people experience and interpret events. These alternatives present serious challenges to James’s and Otto’s claims: if a religious experience can be shown to arise from a perceptual anomaly, a brain event, or a social function, then its evidential force for a transcendent reality is undercut. Teaching these criticisms is useful in showing students that the debate is not simply about whether experiences occur—everyone agrees they occur—but about how they are best explained and whether they justify metaphysical conclusions.

## Comparing the three approaches and their implications for religious belief
James, Otto and Swinburne offer complementary but distinct resources for understanding religious experience. James provides a wide descriptive canvas and a pragmatic criterion: the worth of an experience is partly judged by its fruits. Otto zeroes in on the irreducibly emotional and non-rational character of the encounter, insisting that the numinous resists reduction to ordinary categories. Swinburne supplies an analytical framework for treating experiences as evidence, offering rules for when testimonies and personal experiences should be trusted. For students this comparative picture helps in structuring evaluations: James is strong on psychology and pluralism but weak on delivering metaphysical proof; Otto captures the depth of feeling but makes it hard to adjudicate between divine and natural interpretations; Swinburne gives a clear epistemic route to justification but faces powerful defeaters in the form of competing testimonies and natural explanations. Each theory has pedagogic value. James is excellent for exploring varieties and consequences of experience; Otto encourages attention to the qualitative intensity of religious feeling; Swinburne helps develop skills in weighing testimony and defeaters. Together they show that the question “Do religious experiences prove God?” cannot be answered simply; rather, it requires careful attention to what kinds of experience are reported, how reliable they are, what alternative explanations exist, and what standards of evidence one accepts.

## Exam technique
In SQA-style assessments you will be asked to show knowledge, analysis and evaluation. For theory questions begin by defining terms and outlining the thinker’s central claims in clear, accurate prose. Use named examples—Paul’s conversion, Teresa of Avila, near-death accounts, the Toronto Blessing—to illustrate abstract points. For James, include his typology and the four marks of mysticism and explain his pragmatic test; for Otto, explain the numinous and mysterium tremendum et fascinans; for Swinburne, set out the principle of credulity and the principle of testimony and explain what counts as a defeater. In analysis questions explicitly connect features of the theory to examples and consequences: show how James’s focus on fruits affects the evidential value of an experience, or how Otto’s emphasis on non-rationality resists reductionist accounts. In evaluation weigh strengths against objections: test James with neuroscientific findings, challenge Otto with cultural conditioning, and press Swinburne with conflicting testimonies and psychological explanations. Always anticipate counterarguments and respond; a short paragraph acknowledging and rebutting an important objection gains marks. When answering source-based questions read the source carefully and make sure your response fits the task—description for knowledge, links and implications for analysis, and balanced judgement for evaluation. Structure essays with a clear introduction that states your position, body paragraphs that develop one main idea each with evidence and argument, and a concise conclusion that summarises and gives a supported judgement. Manage time so you leave ten to fifteen minutes to proofread and polish your final paragraph. Above all, show that you can move between description, critical analysis and evaluation: examiners reward clear understanding of the theorists, well-chosen examples, and thoughtful engagement with objections.
