# Hinduism: karma, dharma and paths to moksha (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: how these ideas fit together
Karma, dharma and moksha form a coherent framework in Hindu thought that explains human experience, moral responsibility and the ultimate goal of life. Samsara, the cycle of birth, death and rebirth, provides the background: souls (jiva) are trapped in repeated lives because of ignorance and the moral consequences of actions. Karma is the moral law of cause and effect that shapes future lives; dharma describes duty, moral order and the way each person should live; moksha is liberation from samsara, the release that ends suffering. These ideas are not abstract dogma but are used in scripture, stories and practice to guide behaviour, justify rites and motivate spiritual disciplines. Different Hindu traditions interpret and emphasise them in diverse ways, so students should be ready to show both a core, shared understanding and awareness of variation when answering questions.

## Key concepts: atman, jiva, Isvara, avidya and samsara
Central to understanding moksha is the concept of the self. Atman refers to the true Self, often described as eternal and unchanging. Jiva is the individual soul considered as a living being subject to samsara. Isvara (God) appears in many Hindu traditions as a personal deity who may assist in liberation, while Brahman names the impersonal ultimate reality in non-dual schools. Avidya, ignorance or spiritual delusion, is the root problem: because the true nature of atman (and its relation to Brahman) is not understood, beings remain bound by attachment, desire and limited identity. Samsara is the ongoing cycle of births in which the jiva experiences pleasure and suffering. Understanding these basic terms helps explain why moksha is desirable: it ends dukkha (suffering) by removing the conditions—ignorance and attachment—that produce rebirth.

## Karma: types, mechanism and moral implications
Karma literally means action, but in Hindu thought it functions as a moral law in which intentional actions produce future consequences. The system is often broken down into types: sanchita karma is the accumulated stock of past actions; prarabdha karma is the portion of karma that has begun to bear fruit in the present life and explains current circumstances; and kriyamana (or agami) karma is the karma being produced now that will affect future lives. Karma is not merely punishment and reward: it is explanatory, showing how talents, misfortunes, relationships and social position can be the result of prior actions. Many traditions emphasise the intent behind actions: selfless action produces different results from actions motivated by ego or attachment. Moral implications are profound; ethical behaviour, generosity and self-discipline are ways to generate punya (merit) and reduce harmful karma. It is important to recognise that contemporary Hindus interpret karma in many ways—some stress moral responsibility and reform, others use the doctrine to explain inequality, and critics point out how a rigid reading can justify social injustice.

## Dharma: individual duty, social order and moral law
Dharma is a versatile concept that covers duty, moral order, law and the right way to live. At a personal level, svadharma refers to an individual's own duty, often linked to one’s stage of life (ashrama) and social role (varna). Classical texts present varnashrama dharma as a framework in which duties are aligned with one’s caste and age—student, householder, forest dweller, and renouncer. Yet dharma is also understood more broadly as sanatana dharma, the eternal moral order that sustains the cosmos and ethics. Living according to dharma means fulfilling responsibilities to family and society, acting virtuously and maintaining cosmic harmony. The Bhagavad Gita provides a crucial teaching about dharma: Arjuna’s crisis on the battlefield is resolved when Krishna urges him to perform his warrior duty without attachment to results, illustrating the tension between personal conscience and social role. Modern Hindus and reformers have critiqued and reinterpreted varnashrama ideas, emphasising universal duties, equality and conscience over fixed social hierarchies.

## Paths to moksha: the main margas and philosophical nuances
Hinduism recognises multiple legitimate paths (margas or yogas) to moksha, reflecting different temperaments and philosophical positions. Karma marga (the path of action) teaches that selfless service and performing one’s duty without attachment (nishkama karma) purify the mind and reduce karmic bondage. Jnana marga (the path of knowledge) involves study, discrimination (viveka) and meditation to realise the identity of atman and Brahman; it is central in Advaita Vedanta, where moksha is the direct insight that the individual self is not separate from ultimate reality. Bhakti marga (the path of devotion) focuses on loving surrender to a personal deity such as Vishnu, Shiva or Devi; here, grace and emotional devotion can lead to liberation, sometimes conceived as eternal service or union with God. Additionally, Raja Yoga, often associated with Patanjali’s eightfold system, emphasises meditative practice and ethical discipline as a route to samadhi and liberation. Different schools offer different final pictures of moksha: non-dualists describe an impersonal absorption into Brahman, qualified non-dualists (such as Ramanuja’s Vishishtadvaita) describe union yet retained individuality, and dualists maintain an eternal relationship with a personal God. When studying paths to moksha, it is essential to link practice to philosophical aims: actions and devotion are not mere ethics but instruments for transforming consciousness.

## Practices supporting liberation: puja, meditation, mantra and renunciation
Practices in Hinduism connect everyday life with the goal of liberation. Puja, ritual worship performed at home or in temples, cultivates devotion, discipline and a sense of relationship with the divine; mantras and chanting focus the mind and can be vehicles of jnana or bhakti. Meditation, in its many forms, trains attention and detachment, providing direct experience of altered states that point beyond ordinary identification. Pilgrimage, yajna (sacrificial rites) and ethical observances sustain communal and personal dharma, reinforcing habits that reduce ignorance and harmful attachments. At the extreme of practice stands sannyasa, formal renunciation in which a person abandons social ties to pursue intensified spiritual discipline; historically, the renouncer has been presented as a model for moksha-seekers. Contemporary practice shows a wide spectrum: many seek liberation through inner transformation within everyday life, combining ethical action, devotional practices and contemplative techniques rather than strict withdrawal.

## Social and moral debates: caste, reform and modern reinterpretations
The intersection of karma and dharma with social structures has generated debate and reform. Classical readings of varnashrama dharma have been used to justify social stratification and caste-based duties, and critics both within and outside Hinduism have argued that such readings conflict with ideals of equality and human rights. Reform movements, modern Hindu thinkers and many living practitioners reinterpret dharma to emphasise universal duties, moral conscience and social justice. Karma has also been contested: read in a deterministic way, it can appear to excuse social inequality, but many traditions emphasise responsibility and the possibility of change through ethical action and spiritual practice. In contemporary contexts Hindus draw on scriptures, lived tradition and moral reasoning to reconcile ancient concepts with modern values, arguing either for metaphorical readings of ritual and caste rules or for reforming practices that deny dignity. Understanding these debates helps students situate doctrinal ideas in real communities and explains why Hindu teachings continue to be dynamic.

## Exam technique
To succeed in exam answers on karma, dharma and paths to moksha, begin by precisely defining key terms and locating them within a clear framework: explain how samsara, karma and dharma interact and how different margas aim at moksha. For short knowledge questions, give accurate definitions and brief exemplification—mention sanchita, prarabdha and kriyamana when explaining karma, or svadharma and varnashrama when explaining dharma. For analysis, explore cause-and-effect relationships: show how ignorance (avidya) leads to attachment and karmic consequences, or how performing svadharma without attachment contributes to purification. Use specific textual or narrative examples, such as the Bhagavad Gita’s presentation of karmayoga and Arjuna’s duty, to link doctrine to practice and to demonstrate religious significance. For evaluation questions, balance perspectives: compare Advaita and Bhakti understandings of moksha, consider strengths and weaknesses of interpreting karma as moral teaching versus deterministic explanation, and discuss the impact of varnashrama dharma in both classical and modern contexts. Always situate answers within a particular tradition or denomination when asked to, and make the variations clear rather than treating Hinduism as monolithic. Structure longer answers with an introduction that defines terms and outlines your approach, middle paragraphs that develop knowledge, analysis and evaluation, and a concise conclusion that gives a reasoned judgement. In the assignment or extended responses, choose a focused question, use a range of sources to support claims, and make sure your argument is coherent: show what you are arguing, why it matters, and how evidence supports your conclusion. Finally, practice linking belief, practice and ethical implications in every answer: examiners look for depth of understanding, clarity of analysis and the ability to evaluate thoughtfully.
