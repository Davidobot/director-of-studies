# Medical ethics: beginning of life (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: what "beginning of life" covers and why it matters
The topic of the beginning of life asks basic ethical and philosophical questions about when human life begins, what moral status should be given to embryos and foetuses, and how society should regulate medical practices that affect early human life. In the SQA Advanced Higher context this section invites you to combine careful factual knowledge (for example, how IVF works or what UK law says about abortion) with philosophical analysis (what does "personhood" mean?) and an evaluation of religious and non-religious responses. The material is highly applied: students are expected to engage with concrete cases such as embryo research, “saviour siblings”, frozen embryos, and abortion law, and to assess competing moral principles such as sanctity of life, quality of life, autonomy and justice.

To do well you should be comfortable explaining technical terms (zygote, blastocyst, embryo, viability), summarising the relevant legal framework and regulatory arrangements in the UK context, and using ethical arguments and case studies as vehicles for analysis and evaluation.

## Key ethical concepts and frameworks for analysing beginning-of-life issues
There are several philosophical tools that recur across questions on the beginning of life. The principle of the sanctity of life holds that human life has intrinsic value and must be protected. It underpins many religious objections to abortion and embryo destruction. In contrast, appeals to quality of life argue that the value of a life depends on features like consciousness, capacity for pleasure and suffering, and foreseeable wellbeing. A rights-based account focuses on who holds rights and when: does the embryo or foetus possess a right to life, and how does that right conflict with the pregnant person’s rights over their own body?

Medical ethics often uses a four-principle approach—autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice—to structure reasoning. Autonomy emphasises the pregnant person’s control over decisions affecting their body; beneficence and non-maleficence require doctors to promote wellbeing and avoid harm; justice draws attention to fair access to services and fair treatment of those affected by decisions. Utilitarian reasoning evaluates actions by their consequences—for example, whether permitting embryo research will lead to greater overall health benefits—while virtue ethics asks what a virtuous person or medical professional would do in difficult situations. Understanding these frameworks allows you to compare different responses and to evaluate strengths, weaknesses and implications.

## Sanctity of life, personhood and moral status of embryos and foetuses
Perhaps the most contested question in this topic is “When does personhood begin?” Different criteria are used in philosophical discussion. Genetic definitions point to conception, arguing that a unique human genome marks the start of life. Biological definitions consider stages such as implantation or the formation of a primitive streak. Consciousness-based accounts locate personhood where sentience or self-awareness first emerge. Viability-based accounts use the point at which a foetus can survive outside the womb (which moves earlier as medical technology advances) as ethically significant. Potentiality arguments stress that even if an embryo lacks current personhood, its potential to become a person gives it moral weight.

Religious traditions also provide varied accounts. Some hold that moral status begins at conception on theological grounds, leading to strong pro-life positions. Others allow for gradations of moral worth or appeal to concepts such as “ensoulment” to mark a later point of full moral status. In secular debate, philosophers like Mary Anne Warren set out criteria for personhood (consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated activity, capacity to communicate, presence of self-concepts), and argue that early embryos do not meet these criteria. These debates shape how we judge practices such as destructive embryo research or late-term abortion.

## Treatment and use of embryos: IVF, stem-cell research and saviour siblings
Assisted reproductive technologies create many ethical questions in practice. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) typically produces several embryos; some are implanted, some frozen for future use and some surplus embryos may be destroyed. Whether destroying embryos is permissible depends on one’s view of embryo moral status. Embryonic stem-cell research offers potential cures for diseases because embryonic stem cells can develop into many cell types, but it involves destruction of embryos; supporters argue the potential medical benefits justify the research, opponents claim it is a form of killing.

“Saviour sibling” cases, where a child is conceived to provide tissue (such as cord blood) to treat an existing sick sibling, raise distinctive ethical dilemmas. Supporters point to parental responsibility to protect an ill child and the life-saving benefits that can be achieved. Critics worry about instrumentalising the new child, treating them primarily as a means to an end rather than an end in themselves. Questions also arise about consent, welfare of the child created, and the slippery slope toward genetic selection for non-medical traits.

Teaching these topics effectively means linking abstract principles to real-world regulation and case outcomes. Students should be able to discuss how regulatory bodies balance scientific progress against moral concerns, and how ethical reasoning influences policy choices about permissible uses of embryos and acceptable safeguards.

## Abortion: ethical arguments, legal framework and difficult cases
Abortion brings together nearly every moral principle in tension: the right to life of the embryo or foetus, the pregnant person’s bodily autonomy, the welfare of existing family members, and social justice concerns. Ethical arguments for allowing abortion emphasise the pregnant person’s autonomy and the harms of forcing someone to continue an unwanted pregnancy, particularly where health, socioeconomic circumstances or risk are factors. Some utilitarians argue that permitting abortion reduces suffering and can produce better overall outcomes. Arguments against abortion often invoke the sanctity of life or the moral status of the unborn, treating abortion as the unjustified killing of an innocent.

In many legal systems the morality of abortion is reflected in specific time limits and exceptions. Practical issues such as ectopic pregnancy and risks to the mother’s life complicate simplistic positions: the principle of double effect is sometimes invoked in medical ethics when a procedure intended to save the mother’s life also results in the unintended death of the foetus. The status of foetal abnormality, where severe congenital conditions are diagnosed, raises hard questions about late-term abortion and quality-of-life considerations. Effective essays will weigh particular cases—such as pregnancies resulting from rape, or where the life of the mother is at serious risk—against general principles, showing how moral rules may be applied or limited in practice.

## Religious and non-religious responses: diversity and common themes
Religious responses are not monolithic. The Roman Catholic tradition is often associated with an absolute protection of life from conception and a strong prohibition on abortion and embryo destruction, appealing to the sanctity and inviolability of human life. Other Christian denominations, and different strands within those traditions, may adopt more permissive positions in particular circumstances, balancing the rights and wellbeing of the pregnant person against concerns for the unborn. Islamic ethical thought places great emphasis on the sanctity of life but also includes debates about ensoulment and the permissibility of abortion within certain timeframes and conditions, often allowing more room for exceptions to protect the mother. Jewish ethics typically gives priority to the life and wellbeing of the mother in many cases, treating the embryo as having moral worth but not equal status to a born person.

Secular responses range from humanist approaches that prioritise autonomy, scientific progress and reducing suffering, to philosophical opponents of abortion grounded in secular accounts of the wrongness of killing persons. Utilitarian thinkers focus on consequences and may support embryo research and lawful abortion as means to maximize wellbeing. Rights-based secular thinkers emphasise bodily autonomy and legal protections for reproductive choice. In the classroom it is useful to contrast these positions, show internal diversity within traditions, and relate abstract commitments to how adherents actually respond to cases.

## Applying theory to case studies: practical examples for essays and assessments
To show depth, students should use specific cases and hypothetical scenarios to test arguments. The “saviour sibling” case allows exploration of parental duty, instrumentalisation, and medical benefit. The example of frozen embryos raises questions about consent for future use, ownership, and the ethicality of discarding embryos. The diagnosis of a severe foetal abnormality in late pregnancy tests commitments to sanctity of life against compassion and quality-of-life considerations. Ectopic pregnancy illustrates the medical necessity that can morally justify interventions which result in the loss of embryonic life as an unintended side-effect. When using cases, explain the facts clearly, identify the competing principles, map how different ethical frameworks would resolve the case, and then offer a reasoned judgement that recognises complexity.

A strong response will not only state what should be done but explain why, consider likely objections, and refer to relevant legal or regulatory context in the UK where appropriate. Using comparative examples—showing how different religious traditions or philosophical theories would respond—helps demonstrate breadth of understanding.

## Exam technique
Approach essays and source-based questions with a clear structure and disciplined time management. For essay questions begin with a concise introduction that defines key terms (for example, “sanctity of life”, “personhood”, or “autonomy”) and outlines the question’s scope. Develop your argument in well-signposted paragraphs: state a point, support it with reasoned argument and, where appropriate, an example or legal/regulatory fact, then consider a counter-argument and respond to it. Aim to balance description, analysis and evaluation: SQA rewards not only accurate knowledge but critical engagement and reasoned judgement.

When answering unseen sources, follow the three-tier approach demanded in assessments: for knowledge questions describe the idea succinctly in your own words; for analysis questions unpack implications, relationships and consequences; for evaluation questions give a clear value judgement supported by reasons and counterpoints. Use relevant case studies to show application, and whenever you make a claim ask “what would someone who disagrees say?” then address that objection briefly to show critical breadth.

Timing matters. In a three-hour paper allocate time so that you can plan each essay, write clearly, and leave a few minutes to check for clarity and to ensure you have engaged with the question directly. In the dissertation or coursework, pick a question that allows you to deploy a variety of sources and perspectives, keep to the required word limit, and structure the work with an explicit research question, literature overview, analysis and a supported conclusion.

Finally, clarity and precision in language are essential. Avoid vague moralising; instead make explicit which ethical principle you are using, explain how it applies to the facts, and draw a provisional conclusion that recognises limits and alternative views. This approach demonstrates the analytical and evaluative skills that SQA expects for Advanced Higher Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies.
