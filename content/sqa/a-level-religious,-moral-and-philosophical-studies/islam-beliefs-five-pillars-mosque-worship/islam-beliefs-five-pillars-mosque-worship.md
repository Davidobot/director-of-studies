# Islam: beliefs, Five Pillars and mosque worship (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction and overview
Islam is one of the world’s major religions and, for the purposes of Higher RMPS, is studied as a coherent system of beliefs and practices that shape the lives of its adherents. At the centre of Islamic thought is a unity of belief and action: doctrinal ideas about God, humanity and the afterlife inform ritual obligations, ethics and community life. This revision guide concentrates on core theological concepts (beliefs about God, human nature, prophethood and eschatology), the central practices known as the Five Pillars, and the role of mosque worship. Throughout the material, attention is given to how beliefs and practices interrelate, how variations within Islam (for example between Sunni and Shia traditions) can affect understanding and practice, and how these features contribute to the identity and social life of Muslim communities.

## Tawhid: beliefs about God
Tawhid — the oneness and uniqueness of God — is the foundational belief in Islam. God (Allah) is understood as absolute, transcendent, indivisible and the sole object of worship. Key attributes typically emphasised include omnipotence, omniscience, mercy and justice, and Muslims express these attributes in daily devotion and theological reflection. Tawhid shapes how Muslims read scripture, understand creation and relate ethically to the world: if God is uniquely sovereign, then moral obligation and submission flow directly from that reality. The Qur’an and the prophetic tradition provide both theological language and practical exemplars for understanding God’s attributes; students should be able to explain how attributes like mercy and justice can be held together in Islamic theology and how competing questions (for example about suffering) are approached within that framework.

## Human nature, prophethood and Muhammad
Islamic anthropology sees human beings as created with free will but also as entrusted with responsibility. The concept of khalifa (steward or vice-regent) captures the idea that humans are placed in the world to care for it and to live in accordance with God’s guidance. Freedom is real but bounded by divine command and moral accountability. Prophethood is the mechanism by which God communicates guidance; Muhammad is regarded as the Seal of the Prophets and the exemplar whose life (the Sunnah) and sayings (hadith) are used alongside the Qur’an to interpret belief and practice. Understanding Muhammad’s role requires students to distinguish between the Qur’an as revelation and the Sunnah as the model for living out that revelation. There is also scope to discuss the different emphases in Sunni and Shia outlooks: both recognise Muhammad’s centrality, but Shia thought places particular theological importance on the authority of the ahl al-bayt (the Prophet’s family) and the concept of Imamate, which affects how leadership and religious authority are understood.

## Akhira: Day of Judgement, Heaven and Hell
Belief in Akhira, the afterlife, and the Day of Judgement is a core pillar of Islamic creed. Muslims hold that life on earth is a testing ground and that human actions have eternal consequences. The Day of Judgement is depicted in vivid eschatological language in the Qur’an and hadith: individuals will be resurrected, judged according to their deeds and faith, and sent to reward (al-Jannah) or punishment (Jahannam). These teachings function theologically and ethically: they provide ultimate meaning for moral decision-making and a framework for justice beyond the limitations of worldly courts. Students should be able to explain how eschatological beliefs motivate practices such as charity, repentance and community responsibility, and to analyse how different interpretations of judgement and divine mercy have been articulated within Islamic theology, including responses to the problem of suffering and evil.

## The Five Pillars: meaning and practice
The Five Pillars are the primary set of religious duties that structure Muslim life and provide practical expression of core beliefs. The Shahada, the declaration of faith, is the verbal affirmation that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is God’s messenger; this statement functions as the entry point into the Muslim community and as a constant reminder of tawhid. Salah, the five daily prayers, organises time and consciousness around worship; prayer combines ritual actions, Qur’anic recitation and specific postures, and it is practised both individually and congregationally. Zakah, the obligatory almsgiving, institutionalises social justice by mandating a proportion of wealth be redistributed to support those in need, reflecting an ethic that links personal piety with social responsibility; in some contexts additional forms of obligatory giving, such as khums in Shia practice, complement or modify this duty. Sawm, fasting in the month of Ramadan, cultivates self-discipline, empathy for the poor and spiritual reflection, while Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, is a once-in-a-lifetime requirement for those who are able and encapsulates ritual reenactment of foundational moments in Islamic history. Throughout teaching, it is useful to show how each pillar embodies central theological themes — for example, how prayer reinforces tawhid, how zakah embodies communal stewardship, and how pilgrimage symbolises unity and submission.

## Mosque worship and the communal dimension
The mosque (masjid) is more than a place for ritual prayer: it is a social, educational and judicial hub in many Muslim communities. Architecturally, mosques are oriented toward the qibla (direction of Mecca) and often include features such as a mihrab (niche indicating qibla), a minbar (pulpit for sermons) and spaces for ablution. Congregational prayer, especially the Friday midday service (Jumu’ah), is central to communal worship and provides an occasion for collective identity, moral teaching and community announcements. Mosques host Qur’anic study circles, charity drives and rites of passage, tying doctrine to lived practice. When studying mosque worship, students should consider both the spiritual mechanics of prayer — ritual purity, recitation, prostration — and the sociological functions of the mosque. It is also important to note variations in practice: differences in call to prayer, roles of imams, and gendered spaces are shaped by local custom, legal schools and denominational positions, all of which affect the lived experience of worship.

## Submission, law and everyday religious life
The word Islam literally means “submission” or “surrender” to God, and this concept permeates ethical reasoning, community norms and legal frameworks. Sharia is the term commonly used for divine law as interpreted by jurists; in practice it includes rituals, personal status rules and ethical norms but is applied differently across historical periods and cultures. Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) offers tools for deriving rulings from scripture, and different legal schools (madhahib) provide interpretative diversity. Living according to Islam therefore involves both personal devotion and engagement with a moral-legal tradition, encompassing matters as varied as eating and dress, business conduct, family law and political authority. For students it is helpful to trace how principle becomes practice: for example, how the Qur’anic emphasis on caring for the vulnerable is operationalised through zakah and charity, or how prophetic exemplars shape ethical decision-making in complex cases. Awareness of diversity — how local custom, historical context and denominational affiliation influence interpretation — is essential for balanced explanation and evaluation.

## Exam technique
When answering Higher RMPS questions on Islam, aim first to demonstrate secure knowledge before moving into analysis and evaluation. Begin by defining key terms succinctly and situating your answer in a specific tradition where appropriate; stating whether you are referring to Sunni or Shia perspectives can strengthen the answer. For the knowledge component, describe beliefs and practices clearly and use brief examples to show how doctrine connects with lived religion, for instance explaining how tawhid informs the Five Pillars or how mosque worship fosters community cohesion. For analysis, unpack reasons and implications: explain why a belief leads to a particular practice, how different interpretations arise, and what social or ethical effects follow. For evaluation, offer balanced judgement by weighing strengths and weaknesses, comparing religious and non-religious responses where relevant, and considering internal diversity within Islam. Use the skills SQA highlights: relevance, significance and impact in world religion questions; evaluation of religious and non-religious stances in morality questions; and structured argument in philosophical questions. Structure longer answers into clear paragraphs that develop a point, provide evidence or example, analyse implications and then evaluate. Finally, conclude with a reasoned summary that answers the question directly. Practice by planning timed answers to past-style prompts, ensuring you can explain, analyse and evaluate within the constraints of the exam.
