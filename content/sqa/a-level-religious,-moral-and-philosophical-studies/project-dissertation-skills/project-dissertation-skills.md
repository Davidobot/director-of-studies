# Project–dissertation skills (research, argumentation, referencing) (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview and purpose of the dissertation
The project–dissertation in Advanced Higher RMPS is an extended piece of independent research worth a substantial part of the course assessment, and it is designed to show your ability to carry out sustained inquiry into a religious, moral or philosophical question. You will normally produce between 3,000 and 4,000 words of focused, analytical writing that demonstrates in-depth factual knowledge, coherent organisation of material, balanced analysis of arguments and evidence, and a supported conclusion. The dissertation is not simply an exercise in description: it is an opportunity to set a clear research question, engage critically with a range of sources, develop a reasoned argument, and reflect on the implications of your findings. Because the dissertation contributes significantly to your overall grade, choosing an appropriate topic and managing the project with discipline are essential steps in achieving a high standard of work.

## Choosing and refining a research question
A strong dissertation starts with a well-chosen question. The best questions are complex enough to invite sustained investigation, clear enough to be manageable within the word limit, and open to multiple perspectives so that you can show critical engagement. When you begin, think in terms of an interrogative sentence rather than a topic title: “To what extent does Swinburne’s account of religious experience provide a reliable basis for belief in God?” is sharper and more useful than “Religious experience.” Narrowing helps: instead of attempting to cover all responses to euthanasia, you might examine the philosophical justifications for physician-assisted dying in relation to concepts of autonomy and sanctity of life. Familiarity with the course content helps. Pick a question linked to philosophy of religion, medical ethics or religious experience—areas you have studied—so you can draw on course concepts (for example cosmological and teleological arguments, sanctity of life, or James and Otto on religious experience). Early refinement is crucial: test your question against the availability of sources, and be ready to adjust scope if you find either too little trustworthy material, or an unmanageably large field of literature.

## Research strategy and selecting sources
A successful dissertation depends on the quality and variety of the sources you use. Aim to combine primary materials—philosophical texts, scriptural passages, legal documents, case studies or recorded testimonies—with a broad range of secondary scholarship such as academic books, peer-reviewed articles, reputable commentaries and thoughtful, reliable online material. When using internet sources, check the author’s credentials, the publisher, and whether the work is peer-reviewed or affiliated with a recognised institution. Primary sources are essential where argument depends on close reading: if discussing Paley, quote his design analogy and show how later thinkers responded; if the topic is organ allocation, consult policy documents and ethical guidelines. Keep careful, organised notes that record full bibliographic details at the moment you consult a source—this avoids later panic when preparing your reference list. Use systematic searching techniques with library catalogues and journal databases, and consider structured searches for specific terms, dates and authors. A good balance is to use at least three substantial secondary sources plus a handful of targeted primary texts or case materials; more sources are acceptable, but each should add something distinct to your argument rather than simply increasing quantity.

## Structuring the dissertation and developing argumentation
A clear structure helps readers follow your reasoning and allows examiners to see how well you can build and defend an argument. Start with a short, focused introduction that states the research question, explains its significance, and outlines the structure of the dissertation. A typical body might include a brief literature review or context-setting section, a methodology paragraph outlining how you approached the question (for example, comparative textual analysis, evaluation of case studies, or critical discussion of philosophical arguments), followed by several substantive chapters or sections that each develop one strand of your argument. Each section should start with a topic sentence linking to the main thesis, present evidence or reasoned claims, analyse that evidence, and conclude by showing how the material advances your overall case. Balance description with critical engagement: description sets the scene and explains positions, but evaluation—critiquing assumptions, weighing counter-arguments, and assessing implications—is where you earn higher marks. Make sure to include engagement with opposing views and to address weaknesses in your preferred position; demonstrating that you can fairly present an opponent’s case and then rebut or qualify it is central to advanced-level work. Close with a succinct conclusion that answers the research question directly, summarises the key lines of argument, indicates limitations of your study, and suggests possible directions for further research.

## Analysis and evaluation: the difference and how to show both
At Advanced Higher you are expected to move beyond accurate explanation to sustained analysis and evaluation. Analysis involves breaking down complex material into its component parts, explaining background, identifying implications, making connections between ideas, and predicting consequences. For example, when analysing the cosmological argument you might examine different formulations—Aquinas’ contingency, Leibniz’s sufficient reason, or the Kalam argument—showing how each proceeds from its premises to its conclusion and noting where assumptions differ. Evaluation then appraises the strength of those moves: are the premises plausible, do the inferences hold, how persuasive are the counter-arguments, and what are the broader philosophical or practical implications? Good evaluation is evidence-based, acknowledges complexity, and avoids dogmatic assertions. Practically, aim in each substantive paragraph to offer both an explanation and an evaluative sentence or two that assesses the claim’s merits relative to your thesis. Use signposting language to guide the reader: make explicit when you are analysing, when you are weighing rival claims, and when you are drawing a conclusion.

## Referencing, quotations and academic integrity
Consistent and accurate referencing shows academic rigour and protects you from unintentional plagiarism. Choose an appropriate referencing system early—common options used in RMPS teaching include author–date styles (such as Harvard) and footnote styles—and use it consistently throughout. For each work you consult record author, title, edition, publisher, date and page numbers for printed texts; for online materials record the URL and the date you accessed it. Use quotations sparingly and always integrate them into your own prose; long block quotes should be rare. Paraphrase when possible, but when you paraphrase you still need to reference the original. Keep a single, alphabetised reference list at the end of your dissertation that includes every work cited in the text. If you use software to manage references, learn it early and check the output carefully—automatic systems can introduce formatting errors. Be mindful of assessment rules about collaboration and assistance: your dissertation must be your own work, produced independently under the supervision arrangements specified by your centre. Familiarise yourself with your centre’s and SQA’s guidance on reasonable assistance and on academic misconduct so you know what support is permitted and where boundaries lie.

## Supervision, authenticity, word count and presentation
Your centre will provide some supervision and control while you complete the dissertation, and you should use supervision meetings as structured checkpoints. Treat these meetings as formal milestones: bring a short progress log, questions about sources or argument, and a plan for the next stage. Centres often use spot-check interviews or checklists to authenticate work; be prepared to discuss and explain your research choices and drafts. Respect the word limit: you must submit 3,000–4,000 words and penalties apply for exceeding the maximum by more than 10 per cent. Front matter such as the title, abstract and contents page is expected, and appendices may be used sparingly for supplementary material such as interview transcripts or raw data, but remember that examiners assess the main text. Ensure your presentation is professional: use clear headings, numbered pages, consistent formatting, and a complete bibliography. Before submission proofread thoroughly for clarity, grammar and argument coherence. A final step should be a referee-style self-check: does each paragraph contribute to answering the research question, are counter-views addressed fairly, and is the evidence cited accurately?

## Exam technique
Although the dissertation is submitted over time rather than written under timed exam conditions, exam technique matters for both the three-hour question paper and the project. For the question paper, practise answering the three types of source-based questions you will meet: knowledge and understanding, analysis and evaluation. A knowledge question requires a concise, accurate description of the issue; an analysis question asks you to break the source down and link it to wider course ideas; an evaluation question asks for a judgement supported by evidence. Time management in the three-hour paper is essential: allocate time in advance to essay planning, writing and review, and practise writing complete essays under timed conditions so you can produce well-structured arguments within the time limit. For the dissertation, treat assessment conditions as an ongoing timed project. Plan backward from the submission date, allocate time for research, drafting and redrafting, and book regular supervisory meetings to authenticate progress. In the final week before submission, prioritise tightening the argument, checking references and removing any non-essential material that does not contribute to your answer; examiners reward clarity and focused analysis over breadth for its own sake. Finally, learn to present a balanced conclusion that answers your research question directly, acknowledges limitations, and indicates why your argument matters—this is the most convincing way to show that you have met the demands of Advanced Higher RMPS.
