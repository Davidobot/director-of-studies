# Alternative accounts of religious experience (psychological, scientific, sociological) (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: what counts as an alternative account and why it matters
Religious experiences—mystical states, conversions, visions, miraculous healings and a felt sense of God—are central topics in Advanced Higher RMPS. Alternative accounts do not accept a supernatural cause for these events; instead they explain them in terms of human psychology, brain processes and social conditions. Studying these accounts is important because they challenge the claim that religious experiences provide straightforward evidence for the divine, while also helping us understand how such experiences function in people’s lives and communities. For students this means learning to describe specific accounts, analyse how they explain particular experiences, and evaluate their strengths and limits in relation to faith perspectives and philosophical arguments about experience.

## Psychological accounts: Freud, Jung and personality, crisis and conditioning
Psychological explanations interpret religious experience as originating within the mind rather than in an external supernatural agent. Sigmund Freud argued that religious feelings are projections of human wishes and anxieties; religion, in his account, can be an expression of infantile longings for a protective father figure or a displacement of unresolved inner conflicts. From a clinical perspective, conversion and mystical states may occur during periods of intense emotional crisis when the psyche reorganises itself, producing sudden insights or experiences felt as transformative. Carl Jung offered a different psychological model, suggesting that religious symbols and archetypal experiences emerge from a collective unconscious and can be psychologically meaningful without being reducible to pathology. Jung would treat mystical content as an encounter with deep archetypal material that can lead to individuation and personal growth.

Beyond these founders, contemporary psychologists point to factors such as personality traits, mood states, and prior expectations. Highly suggestible individuals, those with strong imaginations or certain personality profiles, are more likely to report vivid experiences. Cognitive processes such as dissociation, sleep–wake boundary events, and heightened emotional arousal can all contribute to experiences that participants interpret religiously. Clinical conditions also intersect with religious experience: temporal lobe epilepsy, certain psychoses, and extreme exhaustion can produce visions, intense religious feelings or a sense of presence. Psychological accounts are pedagogically useful because they explain the variability of experiences between individuals and the way personal history and mental states shape meaning. Their main limitations are that they can be reductionist—dismissing every experience as mere pathology or projection—and that they sometimes struggle to account for cases where experiences have long-term, positive moral and intellectual effects.

## Scientific and neuroscientific accounts: brain states, neurochemistry and evolutionary explanations
Scientific accounts probe the neural and evolutionary bases of religious experience. Neuroimaging research has shown that particular brain regions are commonly involved when people report mystical unity, intense religious emotion or altered states of consciousness. Studies point to decreased activity in regions responsible for self–world distinction, such as parts of the parietal lobe, and increased activation in limbic regions associated with emotion. Researchers working in the field of “neurotheology” propose that these patterns could explain the sensations of boundlessness, timelessness and profound meaning that many report. Experiments that manipulate brain activity, including controversial attempts to induce religious-type experiences by applying weak electromagnetic fields to the skull, have sometimes produced unusual subjective effects; such work is often invoked to argue that religious experiences are brain states rather than encounters with the supernatural.

Evolutionary approaches offer a different scientific angle. They account for religious tendencies as by-products or adaptations. One proposal is that hyperactive agency detection—an evolved tendency to assume an intentional agent behind ambiguous events—makes humans prone to perceive spirits or gods. Other accounts suggest that religious beliefs and experiences support group cohesion and cooperative behaviour, giving social advantages to communities that shared ritual and belief. These evolutionary explanations illuminate why religious feeling is widespread and closely tied to rituals and moral systems.

Scientific accounts contribute important empirical data, but they also have limits. Correlations between brain activity and reported experiences do not by themselves settle questions about ultimate causes; critics point out that finding a neural correlate of an experience is compatible both with a purely natural explanation and with the idea that a divine event is mediated by the brain. Methodological issues—small sample sizes, difficulties replicating provocative experiments, and interpretive leaps from activation patterns to subjective meaning—mean that neuroscientific results must be read with caution. Nevertheless, science provides persuasive tools for understanding mechanism, predisposition and function.

## Sociological accounts: Durkheim, Marx, Weber and the social shaping of experience
Sociological analyses shift the focus from individual minds and brains to collective life. Émile Durkheim famously argued that religious experience is rooted in social realities: the intensity of communal ritual produces “collective effervescence,” a shared emotional energy that participants may interpret as contact with the sacred. From this perspective, the content and force of religious experiences are products of group practices, symbols and shared meanings. Karl Marx offered a different sociological critique, seeing religion as an ideological response to material and social conditions. Religious experiences and beliefs, in Marx’s view, can reflect and reinforce existing class structures by offering consolation or deflection from social injustice. Max Weber concentrated on the role of charismatic leaders and the social processes by which extraordinary experiences are institutionalised and routinised; Weber’s account helps explain how personal conversions or prophetic experiences become the basis for long-term religious movements.

Sociology is particularly helpful in explaining why certain types of experience cluster in specific contexts—why revivals produce mass conversions, why pilgrimage often produces intense religious feeling, and why charismatic movements encourage expressive, ecstatic states. It also explains the social work that religious narratives perform: legitimising authority, shaping identity and sustaining moral orders. The main critique of sociological accounts is that they can underplay individual authenticity and the subjective conviction of experiencers; to reduce all experiences to social function risks missing the phenomenological aspect that makes them compelling to those who have them.

## Integrating accounts and responding to faith perspectives
A careful classroom approach recognises that psychological, scientific and sociological accounts are not always mutually exclusive. Many experiences admit of multi-level explanations in which brain processes, personality predispositions and social setting interact to produce phenomena that the subject interprets in religious terms. For instance, a meditator with a predisposition for absorption may, after extended practice in a culturally framed setting, report a non-dual experience that has a distinct neural signature, social validation and profound personal consequences. Such an integrated view allows students to see how naturalistic explanations can coexist with, challenge, or supplement religious interpretations.

Faith perspectives respond in various ways. Some theists accept that God may work through natural mechanisms; for them, neural correlates do not disprove divine agency but show the means by which the divine is experienced. Other believers argue that natural explanations fully account for the phenomenon and therefore remove the experiential evidence for the divine. Philosophers of religion add further nuance: defenders of the credibility of religious experience argue for epistemic reliability in certain conditions, while critics insist that the availability of natural explanations reduces the evidential weight of such experiences. Teaching this topic well involves encouraging students to weigh explanatory power, scope, parsimony and respect for first-person testimony, and to consider whether naturalistic accounts threaten, explain, or simply re-describe religious claims.

## Case studies and classroom approaches
Using concrete cases helps bring abstract accounts to life. The conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus can be used to compare psychological crisis models, possible temporal lobe explanations, and sociological dynamics of early Christian communities. Contemporary examples such as charismatic revival meetings, the Toronto Blessing, or well-documented near-death accounts provide material for comparing interpretive frames: participants often describe similar phenomenology, yet psychologists, neuroscientists and sociologists explain those events in different terms. Mystical reports from figures like Teresa of Ávila can be read alongside Jungian analyses of archetypal imagery and neurophysiological studies of prolonged meditation. In teaching, it is effective to work through one case from each disciplinary perspective, asking students to reconstruct the argument each account makes, identify what evidence supports it, and evaluate its persuasive reach. Role-plays, structured debates and short research projects can help students practise moving between description, analysis and evaluation, and prepare for exam-style source questions and essay writing.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on alternative accounts of religious experience, aim for clear structure, precise knowledge, balanced analysis and a reasoned judgement. For essay questions, start with a concise introduction that defines the type of account you will discuss and signals your argument. In the main body develop two or three well-explained points: describe the account (for example Freud’s interpretation, Persinger’s experimental approach, or Durkheim’s collective effervescence), show how it explains particular experiences by using a case study, and then analyse the strengths and weaknesses of that explanation. Bring in alternative perspectives to evaluate the claim—if discussing a neuroscientific account, consider philosophical objections about correlation versus causation and the limits of reductionism; if discussing sociological accounts, question whether social explanations can fully account for private conviction.

For source-based questions, match the task to the expected skill. For knowledge and understanding prompts, paraphrase the source and situate it in the course framework. For analysis tasks, tease out implications and connections: what follows if the source is true, and how does it relate to a named thinker or theory? For evaluation tasks, weigh the source’s merits against counter-evidence or counter-arguments and reach a supported conclusion. Always use specific examples—classical cases, named theorists and brief empirical details—to show depth of knowledge. Time management is vital in a three-hour paper: allocate time to plan, write and proofread, and ensure you leave time to answer every required question. In all answers aim for clarity, academic tone and a conclusion that answers the question directly, summarising reasons and indicating any limitations in your judgement.
