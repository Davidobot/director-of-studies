# Morality, environment and global issues: poverty, climate and trade (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: why poverty, climate and trade matter morally
Poverty, climate change and global trade are not separate problems; they form a tightly woven tapestry of moral questions about fairness, responsibility and human flourishing. Poverty raises immediate ethical demands about meeting basic needs, dignity and opportunity. Climate change presents time-spanning duties to current and future people, as well as responsibilities towards other species and ecosystems. Global trade sits between them, shaping wealth distribution, environmental exploitation and the capacity of communities to respond to change. A good revision approach treats these issues as interconnected: trade policies influence resource extraction and emissions; environmental harms can drive poverty and migration; and ethical traditions provide different resources for judging actions and formulating responses.

## Poverty and justice: causes, responses and religious resources
Poverty can be caused by a mix of structural factors—unequal access to land and capital, exploitative trade rules, historical imperialism and debt burdens—and by immediate causes such as natural disasters, conflict or failings in governance. Morally, this raises the question of whether we owe positive help to the poor and what form that help should take. Secular moral philosophers offer differing accounts: utilitarians might emphasise maximising overall welfare and therefore favour aid that has the greatest measurable impact; Kantian approaches stress duties of respect for persons and the imperative not to treat people as mere means; Rawlsian theory, with its difference principle, supports arrangements that benefit the least advantaged. Contemporary sharp critiques, such as Peter Singer’s argument, press for strong obligations of distant aid on the grounds of preventing serious harm at little cost.

Religious traditions also speak powerfully to poverty. Christian social teaching emphasises the preferential option for the poor, charity, stewardship and structural justice, while Catholic doctrine includes detailed principles about solidarity and subsidiarity. In Islam, zakat and sadaqah are institutionalised forms of redistribution and care. Judaism’s concept of tzedakah frames giving as justice rather than mere charity. Hindu and Buddhist teachings encourage compassion, non-harm and duty towards community, which can underpin social action and reform. Sikhism stresses seva (selfless service) and vand chhakna (sharing). These resources support both immediate relief and longer-term structural change. In practice, the moral debate often centres on charity versus justice: direct giving alleviates suffering now, but structural reform and fairer trade may prevent suffering in the long run.

## Climate change and environmental ethics: responsibilities and justice
Climate change is a moral problem as much as a scientific one. Greenhouse gas emissions from industrialised nations have driven warming that disproportionately affects poorer countries and future generations, who contributed least to the problem. Climate justice therefore asks who should bear the costs of mitigation and adaptation. Concepts such as common but differentiated responsibilities recognise historical emissions and argue that wealthier nations should take greater action and support vulnerable states.

Religious perspectives often provide foundations for environmental stewardship. Christianity offers stewardship and care for creation as themes in many denominations, with recent papal teaching emphasising ecological conversion and the interconnectedness of life. Indigenous and many Eastern spiritualities, along with strands in Hinduism and Buddhism, promote respect for the natural world and the avoidance of harm. These approaches sometimes align with environmental ethical theories: anthropocentric ethics centre human wellbeing and may justify environmental protection for human ends, while ecocentric or biocentric positions attribute intrinsic value to species and ecosystems and argue for preservation regardless of immediate human benefit.

Concrete moral tensions emerge in policy choices: mitigation (reducing emissions) often requires systemic economic change and sacrifice from current consumers, while adaptation focuses on protecting the vulnerable in a warming world. Questions of intergenerational justice ask how much current generations may justly consume at the expense of future ones. Examples help make these issues concrete: small island states facing rising seas demand stronger global mitigation and financial support; communities dependent on fisheries suffer as stocks collapse due to warming and acidification. These cases test both secular and religious claims about responsibility and the scope of moral concern.

## Trade, resources and global economic structures
Global trade has lifted millions out of poverty, yet it can also entrench inequality, degrade environments and undermine local economies. The structure of international trade—tariffs, subsidies, intellectual property rules and corporate practices—shapes who benefits and who loses. Agreements negotiated through institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the terms imposed by international lenders have been criticised for privileging multinational corporations and richer states, sometimes at the expense of food security, labour rights and environmental protection in poorer countries.

Ethically, trade raises questions about fairness, exploitation and solidarity. Free-market arguments often claim that liberalised trade promotes growth and efficiency, benefiting many. Critics insist that growth alone is insufficient if it concentrates wealth and externalises environmental costs. Concepts such as fair trade and ethical certification attempt to address these problems by ensuring producers receive a living wage, by promoting safe working conditions and by encouraging sustainable production methods. Religious organisations have been active in campaigning for fair trade, debt relief and ethical investment, drawing on teachings about justice, human dignity and the moral limits of profit.

Resource management is a central link between trade and environment. Non-renewable resource extraction—oil, minerals, timber—can generate short-term profit but long-term social and ecological harm: the resource curse, land dispossession and biodiversity loss. Sustainable management and circular economy approaches propose reducing waste, designing for reuse and ensuring that resource benefits are shared. Morally, these approaches connect to ideas of stewardship, fairness between rich and poor regions, and intergenerational obligations.

## Biodiversity, depletion and sustainable development
Biodiversity underpins the ecosystems that provide food, clean water, pollination and climate regulation. Its loss has direct moral consequences for human wellbeing and for the intrinsic worth of non-human life. Depletion of fisheries, deforestation of the Amazon and the global decline of pollinators are not only ecological emergencies but ethical problems that implicate consumption patterns, corporate behaviour and governance failures.

The sustainable development agenda attempts to reconcile economic growth with environmental protection and social inclusion. Sustainability is often articulated as meeting present needs without compromising future generations’ ability to meet theirs. From a moral perspective, sustainable development requires balancing competing goods: economic opportunity, environmental preservation and social justice. Different ethical frameworks will weigh these goods differently. Deep ecology and eco-centric positions might insist on radical limits to growth to protect ecosystems; more anthropocentric or pragmatic viewpoints may seek technological solutions and market mechanisms to decouple growth from environmental harm.

Practical classroom examples bring these debates alive: the consequences of palm oil expansion for rainforest biodiversity and indigenous communities; how overfishing in West Africa affects food security and local livelihoods; or how plastic waste from richer countries accumulates in poorer coastal states. Each example invites discussion of rights, responsibilities, and possible responses at personal, national and international levels.

## Responses in practice: charity, policy and activism
Moral responses to poverty, climate and trade include individual action, community initiatives, policy change and international agreements. Charity and relief organisations perform crucial short-term work, providing food, medicine and shelter. Development agencies and faith-based NGOs often combine direct aid with projects aimed at education, health and sustainable livelihoods. However, many moral thinkers and activists argue that charity must be complemented by advocacy for structural change: fairer trade rules, progressive taxation, debt relief and climate finance.

Policy responses range from carbon pricing and emissions trading schemes to legally binding conservation measures and social protection programs. International agreements, such as the Paris Agreement on climate, create frameworks for cooperative action and finance, while trade agreements can be negotiated to include labour and environmental standards. Civil society and religious groups influence policy by lobbying, grassroots organising and public education. Ethical consumerism also plays a role: consumers choosing fair trade, low-carbon products and companies with strong supply-chain transparency can shift demand and corporate behaviour, though critics warn that market-based solutions cannot substitute for robust regulation.

Teaching these responses involves assessing effectiveness and fairness. Ask whether aid programs empower communities or create dependency, whether carbon markets actually reduce emissions or allow polluters to buy exemptions, and whether fair trade reaches the poorest producers or benefits larger cooperatives. These are the kinds of evaluative judgements that will feature in exam answers.

## Moral tensions and common pitfalls
Studying morality in the context of environment and global issues requires attention to tensions: short-term relief versus long-term justice, national interest versus global solidarity, economic growth versus ecological limits, and individual responsibility versus systemic change. Students should be wary of simplistic solutions. For example, calling for immediate unrestricted help to all suffering people without considering resources and effective distribution ignores questions of prioritisation and implementation. Similarly, denouncing global trade wholesale misses its potential for development when regulated fairly.

Another common pitfall is treating religions or theories as monolithic. Within any tradition there are disagreements: some Christians prioritise stewardship and conservation, others interpret dominion as a licence for exploitation. Secular ethical theories also yield different policy recommendations. Strong answers demonstrate nuance: acknowledging legitimate concerns across perspectives, weighing evidence, and presenting a reasoned conclusion that recognises practical constraints as well as moral ideals.

## Exam technique
When answering SQA-style questions on morality, environment and global issues, begin by quickly identifying the command word and the focus. For a 10-mark question expect to explain beliefs or apply knowledge with some analysis; a clear structure that defines key terms, presents relevant beliefs or theories, and offers explanatory analysis is appropriate. For a 20-mark question you must include evaluation: present arguments for and against, weigh their strengths and weaknesses, use concrete examples or case studies, and conclude with a supported judgement. Always anchor religious responses to specific teachings or practices where possible—citations of concepts like stewardship, zakat, tzedakah or seva strengthen answers—while also bringing in non-religious theories such as utilitarianism, Kantian duty or Rawlsian justice to show breadth.

Use examples to illustrate abstract points: a brief paragraph on Bangladesh as an example of climate-induced migration, or on fair trade coffee as a response to trading inequalities, will make your analysis concrete. When evaluating, consider practicalities and counterarguments: ask whether proposed solutions are feasible, who pays the costs, and whether they address root causes. Avoid unsupported generalisations; instead, link claims to evidence or plausible reasoning. Time management is crucial: allocate about one hour for the longer question paper section and practice writing well-structured paragraphs under timed conditions. For the assignment, choose a clear, focused question you can research well, use a variety of sources, and remember the RMPS resource sheet limit. Above all, aim for clarity, balance and a reasoned conclusion that shows you can analyse, evaluate and apply ethical thinking to real-world problems.
