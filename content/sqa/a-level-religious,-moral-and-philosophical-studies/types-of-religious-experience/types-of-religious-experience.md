# Religious experience: types (mysticism, conversion, miracles) (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: what counts as a religious experience
Religious experience is an umbrella term for episodes in which individuals report encounters, perceptions or transformations that they and others interpret as involving the divine, the numinous, or a profound spiritual reality. In Advanced Higher RMPS this topic is studied both descriptively — to understand different kinds of experience and the classical accounts of them — and critically, to assess whether and how such experiences might count as evidence for religious beliefs. Relevant material ranges from first-person testimony (saints, mystics, converts) to philosophical treatments (James, Otto, Swinburne), through to scientific and sociological accounts that offer natural explanations. When revising, aim to separate careful description of experiences from analytical evaluation: describe what a mystic, a convert or someone who claims a miracle reports, then consider competing explanations and their strengths and limits.

## Key theorists: James, Otto and Swinburne
William James, Rudolf Otto and Richard Swinburne provide different but complementary tools for analysing religious experience. James approached religious experience psychologicaly and pragmatically; in The Varieties of Religious Experience he emphasised that such experiences can be meaningful for the subject and classified them (for example, conversion and mysticism). He also identified characteristic features of mystical states — famously described as ineffable, noetic, transient and passive — which help explain why mysticism resists ordinary description yet seems to carry cognitive content for those who undergo it. Rudolf Otto focused on the qualitative character of the encounter: the numinous, an experience of the wholly other, described as mysterium tremendum et fascinans — a presence that is at once awe-inspiring and attractive. His account highlights the felt, affective dimension of religious experiences. Richard Swinburne takes a philosophical and epistemological approach: he argues that religious experiences can prima facie justify belief in God under his principles of credulity and testimony, unless there are good reasons to distrust the experience or its report. Swinburne’s framework is particularly useful in exam answers when you need to move from description to an argument about justificatory force.

## Mystical experiences: varieties, features and examples
Mystical experiences are typically described as encounters in which the individual reports union with, absorption into, or direct awareness of an ultimate reality. Scholars distinguish between gradual, discipline-based mysticism — produced by meditation, prayer or ascetic practice and often articulated within a religious tradition — and sudden, involuntary mysticism, which can happen unexpectedly and transform a life. The features James set out (ineffability, noetic quality, transiency and passivity) are a helpful checklist when analysing case studies: St Teresa of Ávila and St John of the Cross write of union with God in language that stresses ineffability and intimacy, while Sufi poets such as Rumi speak of annihilation of the self (fana) and a sense of oneness. Modern accounts from contemplative Christianity, Islamic Sufism, Buddhist samadhi and Hindu experiences of samadhi or moksha show overlaps in the core phenomenology, though interpretations differ between traditions. When using examples, note how cultural frameworks shape the way the experience is reported and understood: the same psychological event may be described as an encounter with God, an insight into emptiness, or a merging with Brahman, depending on the religious language available to the experiencer.

## Conversion experiences: types, process and illustrative cases
Conversion refers to a lasting change in an individual’s religious identity, beliefs, values or practices. Classic typologies separate intellectual conversions (a change of belief after reflection or argument), moral conversions (a reorientation of will and behaviour), and social conversions (joining a religious community and taking on a new social identity). William James emphasised the transformative power of conversion, particularly the moral and affective aspects that are not reducible to mere intellectual assent. Two canonical historical examples help show the range: the conversion of the Apostle Paul on the Damascus road is presented as a dramatic, sudden event that reoriented his life and mission, while Augustine’s conversion combines intellectual struggle with an emotional release and moral transformation. Contemporary conversions may be gradual, produced by life events, relationships, or cognitive reflection, or sudden, described as a decisive encounter or revelation. In analysis, it is important to distinguish between the phenomenology (what it felt like, how rapid the change) and the evaluation of causes and truth-claims: conversion is powerful evidence of change but does not automatically validate metaphysical claims about the supernatural.

## Miracles as religious experience: definitions, debates and case studies
Miracles are typically defined as events that are taken to be caused by a divine agent and that go beyond ordinary natural explanations. Hume’s influential sceptical account defines a miracle as a violation of natural law and argues that the improbability of such a violation makes testimony for miracles weak unless the evidence is extraordinary. Aquinas allows for miracles as events beyond the normal order that nevertheless serve divine purposes. C. S. Lewis and later apologists develop the idea that certain events (healing cures, resurrections, providential coincidences) are best explained by appeal to a supernatural cause. Examples cited in study include scriptural miracles, reported healings at Lourdes, and more recent medically investigated cures that remain unexplained. When evaluating miracles, examine the nature and quality of the evidence: are there reliable witnesses, documentation, alternative natural explanations, or methodological controls? Consider also the philosophical challenge from the regularity of natural laws and whether the term ‘miracle’ is being used as a theistic explanation, a symbolic meaning, or a literal intervention. Distinguishing types of miracle claims — private personal occurences, public prodigies, or medically verified healings — helps structure analysis and allows clearer engagement with Humean and theistic responses.

## Alternative explanations and critical perspectives
Religious experiences have been explained in a range of non-theistic ways which are important for critical assessment. Psychological accounts stretch from Freud, who treated religious experience as wish-fulfilment or neurosis, to Jung, who regarded religious phenomena as engagement with archetypes and part of the individuation process. Neuroscientific investigations point to correlations between particular brain states and reported spiritual experiences: studies of temporal lobe epilepsy and stimulation experiments such as the ‘God helmet’ suggest neurological mechanisms can generate intense spiritual feelings. Sociological explanations, drawing on Durkheim, Weber and Marx, argue that religious experiences often reflect social structures: Durkheim sees collective rituals producing ‘collective effervescence’, Weber examines charisma and social change activated by visionary leaders, and Marx treats religion as a socio-economic response. These accounts do not necessarily deny the personal significance or authenticity of experiences, but they offer rival hypotheses about causation. Philosophical critique also matters: Hume’s argument about the improbability of miracles and the problem of unreliable testimony, and debates about the under-determination of metaphysical claims by experience, raise methodological questions about when to accept religious explanations. In exam answers, use these alternative accounts to test the evidential weight of religious experience: they strengthen evaluative sections and show critical engagement with primary theorists.

## Putting it together: assessing evidential weight and religious meaning
A balanced approach recognises two separate but related questions: first, what the experience is like and what it means to the subject; second, whether the experience provides good reason to believe in supernatural realities. Descriptive work — using James, Otto and case studies — establishes the phenomenology and the profound personal significance experiences can have. Analytic work — drawing on Swinburne’s epistemology and sceptical responses from Hume, Freud, modern neuroscience and sociological accounts — tests whether that personal significance should be treated as evidence for truth-claims about the divine. It is helpful to distinguish between justificatory force and existential meaning: an experience can be psychologically transformative and socially consequential without thereby establishing metaphysical claims beyond reasonable doubt. Conversely, cumulative arguments appeal to the variety, number and consistency of experiences across cultures and history, and to the reliability of testimony, to argue for at least prima facie credibility. When preparing essays, make sure to present both sides, explain why certain objections might undermine specific kinds of claims (for example, how naturalistic explanations challenge private perceptual experiences), and identify what would count as decisive evidence either way.

## Exam technique
In the Advanced Higher question paper you will be asked both essay questions and source-based questions. For essays, begin with a concise definition of the key term(s) and state the approach you will take. Use theorists (James, Otto, Swinburne) early to frame your explanations and then illustrate with well-chosen examples: a mystic (Teresa or a Sufi poet), a conversion (Paul, Augustine or a contemporary case) and a miracle case (Lourdes, a medically documented claim) work well. Move from description to analysis by explaining characteristic features and their implications, and then evaluate by introducing alternative accounts and weighing strengths and weaknesses. Structure paragraphs so that each has a clear point, an explanation using theory and example, and an evaluative comment. For source questions, remember the three types commonly asked: knowledge (describe), analysis (explain implications and connections) and evaluation (make a judgement). Read sources carefully and anchor answers to the wording of the passage. For evaluation, avoid simply asserting doubt or belief; instead, explain why a source is persuasive or problematic and use secondary arguments (psychology, neuroscience, Hume) to support your judgement. Time management is crucial: allocate time so you can plan, write and proof-read, and ensure your conclusion does more than repeat the introduction — it should weigh the evidence and state a supported position. Finally, use subject-specific vocabulary accurately, link claims to wider themes in philosophy of religion, and always balance empathy for subjective reports with critical scrutiny of their evidential status.
