# Medical ethics: end-of-life and assisted dying (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: scope and key definitions
End-of-life ethics covers the clinical, moral and legal questions that arise when people approach the end of their lives. Central to this topic are a small number of precise distinctions that students must understand. ‘Assisted dying’ or ‘assisted suicide’ normally refers to a competent person being given help to end their own life, typically by being provided with the means to take a lethal dose. ‘Euthanasia’ usually means another person (often a doctor) actively administering a lethal intervention; euthanasia may be voluntary, non‑voluntary or involuntary, and it may be classified as active (doing something to cause death) or passive (withholding or withdrawing treatment that would prolong life). Palliative care refers to medical and social care designed to relieve suffering and maintain dignity, and it can include measures — such as increasing morphine — that may unintentionally shorten life. Clear definitions help frame ethical analysis and avoid conflating legally and morally different practices.

## Clinical realities and legal context in the UK and beyond
In Britain, assisted suicide and active euthanasia remain illegal. In England and Wales the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide; in Scotland, while there is no equivalent statutory provision, assisting another to die can be prosecuted under common law. These laws sit alongside established and lawful practices that permit refusal of treatment, withdrawal of life‑prolonging interventions and the use of palliative sedation when death is a foreseen, though unintended, consequence. Across the world, legal approaches vary markedly: some jurisdictions permit physician‑administered euthanasia or physician‑assisted dying under strict safeguards (for example, the Netherlands, Belgium and several Canadian provinces), while others allow assisted suicide through organisations that operate in countries such as Switzerland. Comparing different legal frameworks is useful when assessing claims about safeguards, slippery slopes and the effects of legalisation on vulnerable populations.

## Ethical frameworks: autonomy, sanctity, quality, and double effect
Philosophical responses to assisted dying typically invoke a small set of ethical principles. The principle of autonomy underlines many modern arguments in favour: competent adults, it is argued, should have sovereignty over their own bodies and the right to choose death to avoid intolerable suffering. Consequentialist or utilitarian arguments focus on outcomes — reducing suffering, respecting wishes, and sometimes the fair allocation of limited resources. By contrast, the sanctity of life principle, often grounded in religious moral reasoning and in some strains of natural law, insists that life has intrinsic value and must not be intentionally ended, making active euthanasia morally wrong regardless of circumstances. The ‘quality of life’ approach evaluates the worth of continued existence in terms of suffering, dignity, and the capacity for meaningful relationships, and can support permissive policies when continued life is judged to be unbearable.

A commonly used ethical tool in clinical decision‑making is the doctrine of double effect. This holds that an action with both a good effect (relief of pain) and a bad effect (foreseeable hastening of death) can be morally permissible if the intention is the good effect, the bad effect is not the means to the good, and there is proportionality between means and ends. Double effect is often invoked to justify high‑dose analgesia in palliative care, distinguishing it from an act intended to cause death.

## Religious perspectives and moral reasoning
Major religious traditions typically show strong resistance to active measures intended to end life, though there is variation in nuance and emphasis. Roman Catholic teaching, for instance, emphasises the sanctity of life and opposes both euthanasia and assisted suicide, while accepting proportionate palliative care and the withdrawal of overly burdensome treatment. Many Protestant churches also oppose active ending of life but may emphasise pastoral sensitivity, the complexity of suffering, and the moral importance of individual conscience. Judaism and Islam generally prioritise preservation of life, whereas each tradition allows discussion about the permissibility of foregoing extraordinary or futile treatment. Religious reasoning often appeals to metaphysical claims about human dignity, the inviolability of life, and obligations that transcend individual choice; at the same time, pastoral concerns about compassion and the alleviation of suffering lead religious communities to support improved palliative services and to resist overly punitive responses to requests for death.

Non‑religious ethical voices are diverse. Utilitarians and many liberal thinkers prioritise autonomy and argue for legal options that allow individuals to avoid unbearable suffering. Deontological or Kantian arguments, emphasising duties and respect for persons as ends in themselves, may be used to oppose assisted dying on the grounds that intentionally ending life treats persons as a means or violates universal moral law. Virtue ethics asks what a good person or good society would do, inviting reflection on compassion, courage, and the kind of social character that legal changes might encourage or erode.

## Practical issues in healthcare and social care
Several practical questions arise in clinical settings. First, capacity: competent decision‑making is essential for any permissive assisted dying scheme; robust assessment of understanding, voluntariness and consistency of request is therefore crucial. Advance directives or advance care plans allow people to record their wishes about future treatment, including refusal of life‑sustaining therapy, and these play an important role in end‑of‑life decision making. Second, the difference between withdrawing treatment and active ending of life must be explained: withdrawing an unwanted treatment at the patient’s request is widely accepted ethically and legally, whereas administering a lethal injection crosses a different moral boundary for many clinicians and religious groups.

Conscientious objection is another practical matter: many healthcare professionals will refuse to participate in assisted dying on moral grounds, and any legal framework must balance patient access with protection for clinicians’ moral integrity. Finally, the adequacy of palliative care is a central practical concern: arguments against assisted dying often emphasise investment in high quality hospice and community care, while proponents argue that even the best palliative care cannot relieve all forms of suffering and that options for assisted dying are a humane complement to palliation.

## International experience and case examples
International experience supplies case studies for ethical evaluation. In the Netherlands and Belgium, where euthanasia and assisted dying have been legalised under strict criteria, debates continue about scope, safeguards and reported expansions of eligibility. In Canada, Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) was legalised in 2016 and has since been the subject of legislative and judicial review as the courts and legislature consider extensions and criteria. In Switzerland, assisted suicide is permitted under narrow conditions and has led to the development of organisations that provide assistance to non‑residents. Evidence from these jurisdictions is used by both advocates and opponents: supporters point to choice, transparency and regulated practice; critics point to worries about pressure on vulnerable people, diagnostic ambiguity in psychiatric cases, and the cultural message about the value of lives lived with disability or chronic illness. Using comparative evidence requires careful scrutiny of empirical claims and attention to differences in healthcare systems, social safety nets and legal culture.

## Ethical evaluation and classroom discussion
When evaluating claims in essays or class debate, students should combine ethical theory, legal detail and empirical evidence. A strong response begins by defining terms clearly and distinguishing between types of end‑of‑life practice. It then sets out competing principles — for example, autonomy and relief of suffering versus sanctity of life and non‑maleficence — and applies them to a concrete case. Balanced evaluation acknowledges legitimate concerns on both sides: respect for choice and compassion for suffering can coexist with worries about abuse, social pressure, or unaddressed inequalities in healthcare. Students should be prepared to explain how safeguards might work in practice (age and residency requirements, repeated requests, independent assessment, waiting periods) and to critique whether those safeguards are likely to be effective. Where appropriate, bring in the principle of double effect to explain why many clinicians accept some end‑of‑life practices that hasten death while rejecting others.

## Exam technique
Answering exam questions on end‑of‑life and assisted dying requires clarity, structure and evidence of critical thinking. Start by defining key terms and clarifying the scope of the question. For a describe/knowledge question, give clear, concise definitions and include brief examples (for instance, distinguish physician‑assisted suicide from active euthanasia and passive withdrawal of treatment). For analysis, break an argument into premises and conclusions and explain implications; show connections between ethical principles and real‑world practice. For evaluation, weigh strengths and weaknesses of each position, respond to likely objections, and reach a supported judgement — avoid simply listing arguments for and against. Use contemporary examples or comparative case studies to support points, and demonstrate awareness of legal context in the UK as well as contrasting international approaches. In source‑based questions, interpret the excerpt, relate it to course concepts (sanctity versus autonomy, double effect, palliative care), and assess its persuasive force. Throughout, write clearly, signpost your argument so markers can follow the structure, and finish with a concise conclusion that answers the question directly and reflects the complexity of the topic.
