# Christianity: beliefs, practices and worship (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why these topics matter
Christian beliefs and practices sit at the centre of the religion’s identity and shape how millions of people understand God, humanity and the world. For A-level RMPS you need to show both factual knowledge and the ability to analyse and evaluate how beliefs connect to practice. This means understanding core doctrines such as the Trinity and Incarnation, the way Christians explain sin and salvation, and the variety of worship styles and communal obligations that follow from those beliefs. Knowledge should be rooted in examples from particular traditions (for example Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal) because SQA questions frequently ask for answers “in the context of” a denomination or tradition. Throughout your revision aim to link theology to lived religion: how belief makes a difference to prayer, sacraments, community life and moral action.

## Core beliefs: God, the Trinity and revelation
Central Christian belief is monotheistic: there is one God who is the creator and sustainer of all things. Uniquely Christian is the doctrine of the Trinity, which expresses that God is one being in three persons — Father, Son and Holy Spirit — a theological way of holding both the unity and multiplicity of God. Christians understand God as personal, loving, just and holy, and this shapes how they relate to God in worship and prayer. Revelation, especially in the person of Jesus and in the Bible, is the primary means by which Christians claim to know God. The Bible, read differently across traditions, provides narrative, law, prophecy and teaching that form the basis for doctrine and practice. Historical statements of faith such as the Nicene and Apostles’ Creeds summarise the basics of belief about God and were developed in response to early theological controversies; they continue to structure orthodox Christian identity.

## Jesus, the Incarnation and salvation
The person and work of Jesus Christ are central to Christian belief. Christians affirm that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine (the Incarnation). His life, teaching, death and resurrection are read as events that reveal God and bring about human salvation. Theories of atonement explain how Jesus’ death and resurrection restore the broken relationship between God and humanity: classical explanations include Christus Victor (Christ’s triumph over evil and death), penal substitution (Christ bears the penalty for sin), and the moral influence view (Christ’s life and death inspire moral change in humans). Different traditions emphasise different atonement ideas and these emphases influence worship and preaching. The resurrection is crucial because it grounds Christian hope in new life; it is celebrated in the liturgical year and underpins beliefs about judgement and eternal destiny. The notion of salvation is therefore both personal — forgiveness, new life — and communal — membership in the Church and participation in God’s restorative purposes for the world.

## Human nature, sin, judgement and the afterlife
Christian anthropology deals with what it means to be human in relation to God. Traditions speak of human beings made in the image of God (imago Dei), endowed with free will and moral responsibility. The doctrine of sin explains moral disorder and estrangement from God. Some traditions, drawing on Augustine, emphasise original sin and humanity’s inherited brokenness; others stress personal wrongdoing and the capacity for moral choice. The ethical consequences of these views are significant: if human nature is fallen, then moral guidance, grace and redemption become central concerns. Christians also affirm that there will be a final judgement, and traditions differ in how they articulate Heaven, Hell and concepts like purgatory or the Messianic Age. Beliefs about the afterlife shape pastoral practice, liturgy around death and mourning, and Christian hopes for justice and restoration. In answering exam questions, be prepared to explain competing theodicies that address the problem of suffering and evil and to weigh arguments about God’s responsibility and human freedom.

## Worship and sacraments: prayer, Eucharist and baptism
Worship is where beliefs are enacted. Prayer, communal worship, and sacraments are primary practices through which Christians express and receive grace. Prayer takes many forms — liturgical prayer using set texts, spontaneous prayer in charismatic contexts, private devotional prayer, and contemplative silence. The Eucharist (also called Holy Communion or the Mass) is central for many Christians because it commemorates Jesus’ Last Supper and is understood variously as a sacrificial re-presentation, a real presence of Christ, or a memorial. Roman Catholics hold to transubstantiation, Anglicans and Lutherans speak of a real presence in different ways, while many Protestant churches view the bread and wine as symbolic. Baptism marks initiation into the Christian community and raises debates about infant versus believer’s baptism and the meaning of regeneration. Liturgical calendars, rites such as confirmation and marriage, and pilgrimage or devotional practices also reflect theological commitments. The style of worship — formal liturgy, less formal ‘free’ worship, or charismatic services — often signals theological priorities and denominational identity.

## Christian ethics, community and social action
Beliefs about God and humanity inform Christian moral teaching. The Gospels, especially the Sermon on the Mount, set out ethical ideals such as love of neighbour, forgiveness, care for the poor and a commitment to justice. “Living according to the Gospels” means putting these teachings into practice through charity, campaigning, and communal care. Christian organisations like CAFOD, Christian Aid or local church food banks exemplify how doctrine motivates social action. The doctrine of stewardship interprets creation care as a responsibility to manage resources wisely; this has contemporary relevance for environmental ethics. Views about marriage, sexuality and gender arise from scriptural interpretation and tradition, so different denominations reach different conclusions about same-sex marriage, divorce and gender roles. Ethical reasoning in Christianity draws on scripture, tradition, reason and experience, and robust answers in exams will show how these sources interact in forming responses to moral issues.

## Diversity, authority and interpretation within Christianity
Christianity is not monolithic. Historical schisms (for example, the Great Schism of 1054 and the Reformation in the 16th century) produced Orthodox, Roman Catholic and multiple Protestant traditions, each with distinctive theology, worship and structures of authority. Roman Catholicism emphasises the teaching authority of the Pope and Magisterium, the sacraments and a sacramental worldview. Eastern Orthodoxy foregrounds liturgy, mysticism and conciliar authority. Protestantism stresses the authority of scripture (sola scriptura) and the priesthood of all believers, but even within Protestantism there is great variety from high-church Anglicanism to evangelical and Pentecostal movements. Interpretation of scripture varies: literalist readings are common in some evangelical contexts, historical-critical methods in academic and liberal churches, and a canonical-traditional approach in Catholic and Orthodox settings. When answering questions you should state the tradition you are working within or compare traditions to demonstrate awareness of diversity. Understanding denominational differences will strengthen your analysis and allow clear evaluation of claims.

## Exam technique
Answering Christianity questions well requires clear structure, doctrinal accuracy and critical engagement. Begin each answer by briefly stating the focus and, where the question asks for a denomination, specify the tradition you will use. For knowledge and explanation marks, present definitions and summaries of doctrines such as the Trinity, Incarnation, atonement theories, sacraments and key practices; use biblical references, creeds and named theological viewpoints to anchor your points. For analysis, show how beliefs lead to particular practices and consider internal relationships — for example, how belief in the real presence affects Eucharistic liturgy. For evaluation, weigh strengths and weaknesses: compare alternative theological interpretations, assess the impact of beliefs on ethical decisions, and consider challenges such as secular critiques or scientific perspectives. Use examples from worship (a Catholic Mass, an Anglican parish eucharist, Pentecostal services), from social action (a church-run homelessness project) and from official teachings or texts (the Nicene Creed, papal statements) to support arguments. Structure longer answers with clear paragraphs that each make a point, develop it with evidence, and include evaluative comment. Conclude with a reasoned judgement that answers the question directly.

In timed papers, allocate time so that longer, higher-mark questions receive proportionately more attention and always leave a few minutes to proofread and ensure you have answered every part. For the assignment, choose a familiar issue within the syllabus, frame a clear question, use a range of sources, and plan your write-up to show knowledge, analysis and evaluation. Remember that the exam rewards precise theological language, attention to denominational context and thoughtful engagement with controversies.
