# Judaism: covenant, commandments and festivals (A-level Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: covenantal identity in Judaism
Judaism is a covenantal religion: its central theological claim is that God chose a people and entered into an ongoing relationship with them that carries both privileges and obligations. That relationship — the covenant — provides the framework for Jewish belief and practice. The covenant explains why law (halakhah) matters: commandments are not simply ethical suggestions but expressions of the bond between God and Israel. Festivals and ritual cycles then renew, teach and embody the covenant, shaping memory, community and moral character. Understanding how covenant, commandments and festivals interrelate gives a coherent picture of how Judaism functions as a religious system and a lived tradition.

## The covenant: biblical foundations and evolving interpretations
The idea of covenant appears repeatedly in the Hebrew Bible and in later Jewish interpretation. The covenant with Abraham presents the beginnings: God promises land, descendants and blessing and calls Abraham to leave his home and act in faith. The Sinai covenant, revealed to Moses, is the foundational legal and communal pact in which the Israelites accept God's rule and receive the Torah. Later texts, such as prophetic writings and the Psalms, reinterpret covenant in terms of faithfulness, repentance and social justice. Rabbinic literature then systematises the covenant as both a theological reality and a practical framework: the people remain bound to God by observance of mitzvot (commandments) which express loyalty and live out divine expectations.

Covenant is not static. Jewish thinkers from the biblical prophets to medieval philosophers and modern theologians have wrestled with what the covenant requires and how it endures when the community faces exile, persecution or modernity. For example, after the destruction of the Temple, the rabbis reimagined ritual life around prayer, study and ethical deeds so that the covenantal relationship could persist without a central cultic site. Contemporary Jewish denominations — Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and others — read the covenant differently, emphasising continuity, historical development, or ethical core commitments in their respective understandings of what fidelity to the covenant now implies.

## Commandments: mitzvot, law and moral purpose
The Torah contains many commandments; later rabbinic tradition summarised these as 613 mitzvot, a figure popularised by medieval thinkers such as Maimonides. Jewish law distinguishes between ethical commandments that govern justice and interpersonal behaviour and ritual commandments that structure worship and communal life. The Ten Commandments occupy a central place as a concise moral and religious summary, combining duties to God (such as covenantal loyalty and Sabbath observance) with duties to other people (such as prohibitions against murder, theft and false witness).

Understanding commandments requires attention to both text and interpretation. The written Torah provides the raw materials, but much of halakhah comes from the oral tradition and later rabbinic exegesis recorded in the Mishnah, Talmud and codes. Rabbis developed methods of interpretation that allow application to new circumstances, producing a dynamic body of law that governs everything from prayer and dietary rules to business ethics and family life. The distinction between normative halakhic practice in Orthodox communities and more flexible approaches among Reform Jews shows how commandments function as both binding law and as expressions of identity that communities may emphasise differently.

Commandments serve several purposes: they shape communal identity by creating shared patterns of life; they sanctify time and space through ritual acts; they cultivate moral character by habituating ethical behaviour; and they test and express faithfulness to the covenant. This multi-layered purpose is why the study of mitzvot in an exam answer should not only list laws but analyse their social, theological and ethical functions.

## Festivals: calendar, memory and covenantal renewal
Jewish festivals are moments when the covenant is remembered, its stories retold and its demands reaffirmed. The major festivals combine historical memory, agricultural cycles and liturgical re-enactment. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, highlighted in the course specification, exemplify how festivals structure communal reflection and moral renewal: Rosh Hashanah inaugurates the "Days of Awe" with themes of kingship and judgment, symbolised by the blowing of the shofar, while Yom Kippur is the solemn day of atonement marked by fasting, communal confession (vidui) and a liturgy focused on repentance and reconciliation. Together they frame a season of self-examination, communal responsibility and re-commitment to covenantal obligations.

Passover (Pesach) commemorates the Exodus from Egypt and underlines freedom and divine deliverance; the seder meal is an educational ritual that compels retelling and asking, linking history with present action by removing chametz, eating matzah and reciting the Haggadah. Shavuot celebrates the giving of the Torah at Sinai and is traditionally associated with study and the eating of dairy foods, while Sukkot recalls the time of wandering in the wilderness and the dependence on God, enacted by dwelling in temporary booths (sukkot) and waiving the four species (lulav and etrog). Weekly Shabbat is also festival-like: a recurring sanctification of time that offers rest, prayer and family life and is often described by Jews as a "taste" of the world to come. Festivals thus educate, renew and remind Jews of their special relationship with God.

Festivals are practised differently across communities. Liturgical language, musical styles and particular customs vary between Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi traditions, and denominations differ in the theological emphases they draw from festival observance. In modern Israel, some festivals retain strong civic and cultural presence even among non-observant Jews, showing how festival rhythms can sustain a national as well as a religious identity.

## Living the covenant: practice, ethics and contemporary challenges
The covenant is realised in everyday practice. Observance of commandments and participation in festivals both embody a continuous re-enactment of the covenantal bond. Ritual observance — keeping kosher, observing Shabbat, reciting prayers such as the Shema and the Amidah — organizes daily life around divine commandments and creates a rhythm in which faith is expressed through action. Ethical commandments, emphasised by prophets and sages, orient the covenant towards justice: care for the stranger, the widow and the orphan, and fair treatment in business reflect how law and morality intertwine.

Modernity raises questions about the application and meaning of commandments. Issues such as gender roles in religious practice, the permissibility of organ donation, attitudes to same-sex relationships and the place of secular law in Jewish communal life require engagement with halakhic methodology and ethical reasoning. Jewish thinkers use halakhic sources, moral principles and comparative reasoning to make decisions, and different communities reach different conclusions. Teaching this topic successfully involves presenting both continuity and change: the covenant remains the animating concept, but its expression changes as communities interpret ancient texts for new realities.

The covenant also has eschatological dimensions: beliefs in divine judgment, the Messiah, the Messianic Age and Olam Ha'ba (the world to come) influence how festivals and commandments are understood as preparing for a redeemed future. These beliefs vary in emphasis across Jewish thought, but they often motivate ethical living and communal hope, linking present observance with ultimate meaning.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on covenant, commandments and festivals, start by defining key terms such as covenant, mitzvot, halakhah, and the specific festival you are discussing. For a ten-mark question, aim for two or three well-developed paragraphs: give a clear definition or description, include a brief example (for instance, describe the shofar on Rosh Hashanah or the seder elements on Pesach), and offer a short analysis of significance. For a twenty-mark question you must go further: structure your answer with an introduction that sets out the line of argument, several analytic paragraphs that use specific textual or ritual examples, a section that considers an alternative viewpoint (such as a Reform versus Orthodox interpretation), and a reasoned conclusion that weighs the evidence.

Always link practice to belief. Explain how commandments flow from covenantal theology and how festivals function to renew communal memory and moral responsibility. Use concise examples from scripture (for example, the Sinai revelation as the origin of law) and rabbinic practice (how halakhah adapts commandments), and refer to diversity within Judaism where relevant to show complexity. When asked to evaluate, avoid simple lists of similarities and differences; instead, assess strengths and weaknesses. For instance, you can argue that festivals effectively sustain identity because they combine story and practice, but also consider whether some rituals have become more cultural than religious for many Jews.

Be explicit about significance and impact: discuss how commandments shape personal ethics and communal life, how festivals educate and create solidarity, and how the covenant provides both obligation and assurance. If the question invites comparison, compare the role of the covenant in Judaism with how law functions in other religions or compare ritual commandments with ethical commandments within Judaism. In longer answers, signpost your argument so the examiner can follow your reasoning, and end with a concise conclusion that answers the question directly.

For the assignment element or coursework, choose a clear, manageable question related to the course content, use a range of sources including scripture, rabbinic interpretation and contemporary responses, and structure your write-up with a clear argument, evidence and evaluation. Remember the assessment values both knowledge and the ability to analyse and evaluate, so demonstrate factual understanding while developing critical judgement.
