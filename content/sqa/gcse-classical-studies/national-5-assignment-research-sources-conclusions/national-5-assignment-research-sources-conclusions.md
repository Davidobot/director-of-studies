# National 5 assignment: research, sources and conclusions (GCSE Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Course overview and assessment structure
The National 5 Classical Studies course gives you a structured introduction to life in classical Greece and Rome and to the way classical literature reflects universal themes. The course is assessed in two parts: a question paper worth 80 marks and an externally marked assignment worth 20 marks, together forming 100% of the course assessment. The question paper is taken under examination conditions over two hours and covers three sections: Life in classical Greece (30 marks), Classical literature (20 marks) and Life in the Roman world (30 marks, with a choice between Pompeii or Roman Britain). The assignment is research-based and designed to be completed in two stages: a research phase of about eight hours carried out under some supervision and a one-hour production phase completed under a high degree of supervision. Knowing this structure helps you plan your revision and your assignment work so that you are confident about what is assessed and how marks are allocated.

## Purpose of the assignment and the skills you must show
The assignment is an opportunity to demonstrate investigative skills that complement the knowledge tested in the question paper. You choose an appropriate classical studies topic or issue, research it using a variety of sources, and produce a concise piece of evidence within one hour that answers your chosen question. The assignment tests your ability to identify a topic that allows comparison between the classical and modern worlds, to organise and analyse information, to evaluate the usefulness or reliability of at least two sources, and to reach a reasoned conclusion. You must also submit a Classical Studies resource sheet: a single side of A4 containing no more than 200 words that summarises your evidence and provides references. If you fail to submit this resource sheet, a penalty of four marks will be applied to your 20-mark assignment, so include it and keep it within the word limit.

## Planning and carrying out research: practical advice
Begin your assignment by choosing a topic that is focused but flexible enough to allow comparison with modern life. Suitable subjects include Athenian democracy, religion and festivals, women’s roles in Athens or Rome, enslaved people, the Roman army, Pompeian religion and leisure, or life on the Roman frontier at Vindolanda. Spend time in the research stage gathering a range of evidence: literary extracts (translated), archaeological reports and images, museum summaries, reputable secondary readings and, where appropriate, contemporary comparative material such as modern civic structures or festival practice. Keep careful records of your sources and exact quotations so you can reference them on your resource sheet. While the research stage allows work outside class and the use of any resources, the production stage allows only the resource sheet as your support. Use the research time to practise summarising each source in a sentence or two so that in the one-hour production you can quickly weave these points into a structured answer.

During research concentrate on gathering both supporting evidence and any counter-arguments or challenges to your thesis. For example, if your topic is the usefulness of Pompeian wall paintings as evidence for daily life, collect examples that both support the idea (detailed domestic scenes, shops, advertisements) and expose limitations (idealisation, survival bias, limited social range represented). These balanced notes will help you score marks for analysing and commenting on usefulness and for reaching reasoned conclusions.

## Supervision, authenticity and reasonable assistance
The course rules distinguish between the research stage and the production stage in terms of supervision. In the research stage you work under some supervision, which means you can research outside lessons, but your teacher should keep a record of interim progress and may conduct short checks or questioning to ensure the work is yours. Group work is allowed in the research stage, but your final assignment evidence must clearly show your individual contribution. The production stage is tightly supervised: you must be in direct sight of the assessor, must not communicate with other candidates, and may use only your Classical Studies resource sheet. Teachers can give reasonable assistance during the research stage, such as guidance on choosing a topic or possible sources, but they must not provide the question, specific resources to use, model answers, or detailed feedback on drafts. If you need more help than “reasonable assistance” would allow, you may not be ready for assessment at this level.

## Using and evaluating sources
A key skill for both the question paper and the assignment is source handling. Sources fall into broad categories: literary texts (for example Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Livy), archaeological remains (Pompeian houses, Hadrian’s Wall, the Vindolanda tablets), and modern secondary analysis. When you evaluate a source, consider its provenance, purpose and content. For literary texts ask who wrote it, when and why, and what social or political viewpoint it might represent. For archaeological evidence ask where and when it was found, what context it came from, how complete it is, and whether preservation biases might distort the picture. For all sources consider what they can tell us directly, what they cannot tell us, and how they can be corroborated by other types of evidence. For instance, Pliny’s account of Vesuvius gives vivid eyewitness detail about stages of the eruption but reflects one person’s viewpoint and priorities; the casts and the architecture of Pompeii supply material confirmation of the human cost and daily life but cannot capture Pliny’s emotions or selective observations. In your assignment and exam answers a balanced evaluation—pointing out strengths and limitations and offering corroboration or contradiction from other sources—earns high credit.

## Classical literature: themes and the three essential tasks
In the Classical literature section you study a translated text or part-text to explore themes such as leadership, fate versus free will, heroism, conflict and women in society. You do not need to learn Greek or Latin; translations, adaptations and even staged or visual versions can be used as long as they fairly represent the classical view. When preparing for literature questions remember the three essential tasks: describe examples of the chosen theme from the text, explain how those examples reflect views or practices in the wider classical world, and compare the classical view with the modern world. In the exam these tasks are reflected in the question design and mark allocation. For each theme you are likely to be expected to give several clear descriptive points (five marks available), to explain links to the wider classical world (three marks), and to make one or two precise comparisons with modern practice (two marks). Practise building answers that move logically from description to explanation to comparison; for example, in discussing Medea you might describe her constrained role as wife and mother in a Greek household, explain how that reflects the classical expectations of marriage and female behaviour, and then compare that to present-day expectations about marriage and gender roles.

## Exam technique
Time management and structure are as important as the knowledge you bring into the exam. For the two-hour question paper allocate time roughly according to marks: allow about 45 minutes for Section 1 (30 marks total), about 35 minutes for Section 3 (30 marks if you choose Pompeii or Roman Britain), and about 40 minutes for Section 2 (20 marks in two extended-response questions), leaving a few minutes at the end to check your answers. In literature questions follow the three-step pattern: begin with a concise context sentence that locates the example in the text, then provide clear descriptive points that are directly relevant to the theme, next explain how these examples reflect the classical view (use the wider world knowledge you have studied), and finish with a direct comparison to the modern world. Phrase evaluations of sources by naming the source, noting its value (what it uniquely reveals), and pointing out limitations such as bias, incompleteness or survival issues, and then offer corroboration or contradiction where possible. When an exam question asks you to evaluate the usefulness of a source, be explicit: mention provenance, purpose, content and limitations, and state whether, on balance, the source is highly useful, partially useful or of limited use for answering the specific enquiry.

Write clearly and use short paragraphs so each point is evident; examiners award marks for clear, relevant points as well as for accuracy. For the assignment production hour, plan for a short five- or ten-minute outline of your introduction and paragraph order using your resource sheet, then write consistently paced paragraphs that include one or two sourced facts, a sentence evaluating the source, and a linking sentence that compares to the modern world. Ensure your conclusion directly answers the assignment question and explains the degree of certainty in your judgement. Finally, always include and double-check your Classical Studies resource sheet before submission, keep it within 200 words, and make sure it lists the key evidence and references you will use, because losing those four marks for omission can be costly.
