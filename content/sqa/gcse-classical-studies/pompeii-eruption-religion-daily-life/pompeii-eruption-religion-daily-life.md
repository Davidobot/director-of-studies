# Pompeii: eruption, religion and daily life (GCSE Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction and historical background
Pompeii was an ordinary Roman town on the Bay of Naples that became extraordinary because of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Founded long before the Roman period and developed under Roman influence, Pompeii had a full range of urban life: temples and a forum for public business, baths and theatres for leisure, shops and workshops for trade, and houses ranging from modest rooms above shops to lavish domus decorated with frescoes and mosaics. Its sudden burial beneath volcanic ash and pumice preserved buildings, objects and traces of people in a way that rarely survives in other ancient towns. This makes Pompeii an invaluable case study for National 5 Classical Studies when examining the Roman world, because it offers both archaeological evidence and written testimony that together illuminate eruption, religion and daily life.

## The eruption of Vesuvius and Pliny’s account
The eruption that destroyed Pompeii occurred in late summer of 79 AD and is known mainly from two letters written by Pliny the Younger. He describes two distinct phases: an initial fall of pumice and ash that rained down for many hours and made movement difficult, followed by more violent flows of hot gas and debris — what we now call pyroclastic flows — that overwhelmed buildings and people. Pliny the Younger reports warning signs such as tremors and unusual cloud formations, and he tells how his uncle, Pliny the Elder, went by ship to help and died on the shore. Pliny’s letters are a powerful literary source because they give an eyewitness-style narrative and explain how people reacted, but they are shaped by the writer’s purposes and the conventions of Roman letter-writing. For exam use, treat Pliny as a valuable but selective account: it gives details about timing, behaviour and fear, but it offers one family’s viewpoint and cannot alone explain all the physical processes. Modern volcanology complements Pliny by explaining why pumice falls and pyroclastic surges had such different effects on buildings and human bodies.

## Archaeological evidence and casts: what survives and what it tells us
Archaeology at Pompeii supplies the physical record that complements Pliny’s words. When the town was excavated systematically from the eighteenth century onwards, archaeologists discovered buildings, streets, shops and domestic objects frozen in place. Organic remains rarely survive in open air, but at Pompeii voids left by decayed bodies allowed a later archaeologist to pour plaster into these cavities to create casts showing the positions of victims at death; these casts are haunting and instructive evidence of suddenness and suffocation. Carbonised loaves of bread in ovens, wooden furniture impressions, painted frescoes and graffiti all survive in ways that are rare for the ancient world, and they provide direct information about food, decoration, literacy and social life. Archaeological evidence must be handled carefully: it gives reliable physical details, such as the layout of a house or the presence of a bakery, but interpretation of behaviour or belief from objects requires reasoned inference. For example, a lararium with small statuettes suggests household worship, but we infer ritual practice from configuration and comparison with literary sources.

## Religion in Pompeii: household, public and mystery cults
Religion in Pompeii combined traditional Roman public worship, the everyday cult of household gods, and imported mystery religions. Household religion centred on the Lares and Penates and the cult of Vesta; almost every respectable house had a lararium where small images or fresco scenes show offerings and ritual gestures. These private shrines emphasise the Roman expectation that religious duty began at home and linked family wellbeing to the gods. Public religion featured temples on or near the forum, civic priesthoods, communal sacrifices and festivals that reinforced civic identity and honoured both traditional gods and the emperor. Archaeology shows temples with columns, altars and evidence of animal sacrifice, while inscriptions and electoral graffiti reflect the way religion and politics were woven together.

Alongside public and household cults, mystery religions such as the cult of Isis and the Bacchic rites portrayed in the Villa of the Mysteries had followers in Pompeii. These cults offered initiation, secret ceremonies and personal salvation or closer contact with a specific deity, and the villa’s vivid frescoes give an unusually clear visual account of a ritual that seems to involve trance, symbolism and staged action. Mystery cults appealed to different social groups and show the diversity of religious life in the Roman world. When comparing ancient and modern religion, it helps to note continuities—ritual, communal festivals, and personal devotion—and differences, such as the formal role of the state and the variety of imported mystery practices in the Roman period.

## Leisure, entertainment and public buildings
Leisure in Pompeii took place in buildings designed for social life and spectacle. The public baths were more than cleanliness: they were social centres with rooms of varying temperature — frigidarium, tepidarium and caldarium — and an underfloor heating system called a hypocaust. Baths offered exercise, relaxation, business conversations and display. Theatres provided drama and music; Pompeii’s large theatre could host serious plays and public meetings, and the amphitheatre was the venue for gladiatorial combat and more violent spectacle. The amphitheatre in Pompeii is one of the earliest stone amphitheatres and was capable of producing strong public emotions; graffiti and wall paintings suggest that gladiatorial contests attracted betting, factions and local pride.

Dining was a key part of elite social life. Wealthy Romans dined on reclining couches in a triclinium and offered courses that could include fish sauce (garum), salted and spiced dishes, and theatrical or musical entertainment. Wall paintings and archaeological finds show how dining rooms were decorated to impress guests. At the same time, simpler food culture survived in thermopolia — street counters where hot food and drink were sold — which catered to the town’s working population. These different venues together illustrate how public architecture organised social experience, and they allow comparisons with modern leisure complexes such as cinemas, sports stadiums, and cafés.

## Making a living: shops, workshops and the forum
Economic life in Pompeii was varied and visible in the layout of streets and buildings around the forum, the town’s commercial and civic heart. The forum was lined with shops and stalls, and displays of goods and painted signs advertised services. Bakeries with stone mills and ovens have left carbonised loaves, showing both the technology of baking and everyday diet. Fullers, who cleaned and treated cloth, worked with abrasive materials and alkaline agents — ancient laundry was industrial in its own way and often noisy, smelly and hard work. Thermopolia sold ready-to-eat meals in terracotta jars set into counters, functioning much like modern takeaway outlets. Craftspeople such as potters, metalworkers and cobblers worked in workshops often attached to shops and lived in rooms above them, which tells us about the close link between home and work in urban Roman life.

Enslaved people were integral to Pompeii’s economy: they worked in households, workshops and public services. Their presence is attested both in Latin inscriptions and by textual references to prices and markets. The marketplace and slave trade were part of everyday life, and studying them gives insight into social hierarchy and economic dependency. When constructing exam answers, use specific examples — such as ovens with bread or a preserved thermopolium counter — to show how archaeologists infer jobs and living conditions from physical remains.

## Houses and everyday domestic life
The Roman house in Pompeii ranged from simple rooms to sumptuous domus with displays of wealth. A typical well-to-do house had an atrium, an open central room with an impluvium to collect rainwater, and a peristyle garden surrounded by columns. The tablinum served as a reception room, while cubicula (bedrooms), a triclinium (dining room) and service areas completed the layout. Wall paintings and mosaics decorated living spaces with mythological scenes, landscapes or geometric patterns; these decorations were not mere ornament but communicated status, education and taste. The House of the Faun and other grand houses also contained mosaics such as the famous Alexander mosaic (now in a museum) and sophisticated floor plans that show how affluent families used display and space.

Everyday life for most people involved smaller, multifunctional rooms, apartments above shops and neighbourhood streets where daily transactions, gossip and political campaigning were visible on the walls as graffiti. Graffiti ranges from love notes and jokes to electoral endorsements and lists of prices, providing direct evidence of popular literacy and the concerns of ordinary citizens. Women’s lives varied according to class; some elite women managed households and even held religious office as priestesses, while many women were responsible for domestic tasks, childbirth and supervising enslaved workers. Comparing domestic life with the modern world, consider continuity in family ritual and household economy, but also the greater public freedom and legal rights that modern citizens typically enjoy.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Pompeii in the National 5 Classical Studies paper, structure is as important as knowledge. For a “Describe” question aim to give clear, focused factual points with contextual detail; for example, when asked to describe household religion, name the Lares and Penates, describe the lararium and explain how offerings were made. For an “Explain” question you must link your description to what it shows about the classical world: for instance, explain how household shrines underline the Roman expectation of domestic piety and how religion reinforced family and civic stability. For a “Do we still…?” or comparison with the modern world, pick one or two clear points of similarity or difference and illustrate them briefly; avoid listing many weak comparisons.

Use both written and archaeological sources carefully. If a question provides Pliny or another text, evaluate its usefulness: acknowledge what it tells us directly, note its point of view and literary aims, and balance it with archaeological evidence such as casts, carbonised loaves or building remains. Remember that archaeology gives physical detail but requires interpretation, and that literary accounts can be vivid yet selective. When a question asks you to evaluate sources, make two or three reasoned points about strengths and limitations and refer to specific examples.

Time management is vital. Spend the first few minutes planning, decide which details best answer the question and ensure you cover required parts: description, explanation and comparison where asked. Use specific examples by naming buildings (the forum, baths, amphitheatre), artefacts (lararium, thermopolium counter, carbonised bread), or texts (Pliny’s letters) to show precise knowledge. Write in clear paragraphs that directly address each part of the question, and finish with a short conclusion when an evaluative or analytical answer is required. Practise with past-style questions, time yourself, and get used to turning archaeological facts into arguments about everyday life, religion and the impact of the eruption.
