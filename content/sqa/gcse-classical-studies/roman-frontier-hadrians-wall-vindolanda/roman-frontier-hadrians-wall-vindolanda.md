# Life on the Roman frontier (Hadrian's Wall & Vindolanda) (GCSE Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: the Roman frontier in Britain
The Roman frontier in Britain was not simply a single wall but a system of forts, roads, ditches and settlements that marked the northern edge of the Roman province. Hadrian’s Wall, begun in about AD 122 under Emperor Hadrian, became the most visible symbol of Roman control in the north. It ran from the Solway Firth in the west to the River Tyne in the east and was linked to a network of forts where soldiers lived and worked. Vindolanda, a civilian and military site a few miles south of the later stone wall, provides one of the richest windows into everyday life on this frontier. Excavations there revealed multiple phases of occupation, from timber forts in the late 1st century AD to more permanent stone buildings, and an extraordinary assemblage of everyday objects and wooden writing tablets that bring individuals and routines to life.

## Building Hadrian’s Wall and the layout of frontier defences
Hadrian’s Wall began as a physical and symbolic boundary. In places the Romans built a stone wall about 3 metres thick and up to 6 metres high, while other stretches were constructed in turf before being rebuilt in stone. The Wall included milecastles at roughly one-mile intervals, small gated fortlets designed to control movement, and pairs of turrets between them for observation. Larger forts, such as Housesteads, Birdoswald and Chesters, housed permanent garrisons and were connected by the Military Way, a road that allowed rapid movement of troops. The Wall’s purpose combined military defence, customs control and the regulation of trade and people. It was also meant to impress local communities and demonstrate Roman power. Construction relied on organised labour: soldiers themselves built and maintained many of the structures, and the work required engineering skills, surveying and supply chains for stone and timber.

## Soldiers’ lives: routine, duties and accommodation
Life for soldiers on the Wall and at Vindolanda was structured and disciplined, yet far from monotonous. The garrison was usually made up of auxiliary units rather than legions: these were troops recruited from across the Empire who served for around 25 years and gained Roman citizenship on discharge. Daily duties included patrols, repairing and guarding the Wall, training, maintaining weapons and armour, and manning observation points. Soldiers spent time drilling with weapons, practising cavalry manoeuvres where appropriate, and guarding gates and supply stores. Barrack blocks in forts were long, narrow buildings with rooms for contubernia (groups of eight men who shared a tent or room and a mule), and common areas for cooking and socialising. A fort’s principia (headquarters) and praetorium (commanding officer’s house) contrasted with the more communal living of rank-and-file soldiers. There was also a clear division of labour: engineers, carpenters, blacksmiths and medical attendants worked alongside combat troops, showing the army’s role as a complex work-force on the frontier.

## Vindolanda: fort buildings, the vicus and civilian life
Vindolanda’s archaeology shows both military and civilian life closely entangled. The fort itself contained the standard Roman elements: granaries, workshops, a bath-house with hypocaust heating, a hospital (valetudinarium) and administrative buildings. Outside the fort, the vicus grew up to serve soldiers’ needs. This civilian settlement included shops, taverns, workshops, families’ houses and small temples. People in the vicus repaired kit, sold food and drink, laundered clothing, made and mended pottery and leather goods, and provided sexual services and entertainment. Women and children lived and worked in the vicus; although soldiers were officially discouraged from marrying during their service, relationships and unofficial families were common and the material record at Vindolanda attests to women’s active roles. Excavations also reveal industrial activities such as smithing, and small-scale agriculture and animal husbandry supporting both fort and vicus. The fort’s bath-house and latrines hint at regular communal practices of hygiene and sociability that break modern stereotypes of a purely spartan military life.

## The Vindolanda Tablets and written evidence for everyday life
The Vindolanda Tablets are the single most important written source for life on the northern frontier in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries AD. These thin wooden tablets were used for letters, requests, inventories and accounts. They survive because Vindolanda’s waterlogged soil created anaerobic conditions that preserved organic materials. The tablets include personal letters that reveal names, relationships and emotions. One famous example is a birthday invitation from Claudia Severa to her friend Sulpicia Lepidina; the tone is intimate and shows literate women corresponding with one another. Other tablets record routine military business: requests for boots, reports of shortages, lists of supplies and orders for construction. The combination of administrative and personal content means we can read about logistics, supply chains, and the practical difficulties of maintaining a garrison, alongside glimpses of household life, leisure and language use. The tablets demonstrate that Latin was used for both official and personal communication on the frontier and that the army operated an effective bureaucracy even in remote places.

## Economy, religion and cultural interaction on the frontier
The Roman frontier was economically active and culturally mixed. Trade brought imported goods such as wine, olive oil in amphorae, and fine pottery into northern Britain, while local produce and crafts supplied the garrison and vicus. Archaeological finds at Vindolanda and along the Wall—bakeries, fulleries (laundries), blacksmith workshops and shops—illustrate a varied frontier economy. Religious life was equally diverse: soldiers and civilians worshipped a mix of Roman gods, provincial deities and mystery cults. Evidence from the region shows temples dedicated to Roman gods, private household shrines, and the worship of blended deities such as Sulis Minerva at Bath—an example of Romanisation where a native goddess was identified with a Roman counterpart. Mithraism, a mystery religion popular among soldiers, appears in small Mithraea (temples) that catered to male initiates. Rituals, votive offerings and tombstones reveal personal beliefs and commemorations, while votive inscriptions sometimes include names from diverse ethnic origins, showing how people from different parts of the Empire shared life on the frontier. Interaction with local Britons took many forms: trade, labour, local recruitment into auxilia units and occasional cultural exchange, but also conflict and tensions over land and resources.

## How archaeology builds the picture: methods and limitations
Archaeology at Vindolanda and along Hadrian’s Wall relies on careful excavation, recording of stratigraphy, and specialist analyses such as dendrochronology, pollen study and soil chemistry. The survival of fragile items—wooden tablets, leather shoes, textiles—at Vindolanda is exceptional and depends on waterlogged layers that prevent decay. Finds like styluses, wooden combs, gaming pieces and writing tablets transform abstract knowledge into human stories. However, the archaeological record is uneven. Organic materials only survive in special conditions, so everyday life elsewhere may leave less trace. Written records survive in tiny quantities and are biased towards those who could read and write or whose activities generated paperwork. Military sites also preserve more infrastructure than informal settlements. When using archaeological evidence we therefore balance its richness with caution: it can reveal details of routines and objects, but not always the full range of experiences, especially of the poorest or most transient people.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on life on the Roman frontier, aim to show both knowledge and source-awareness. For description questions, set your answer in context: name the site (Vindolanda, Hadrian’s Wall) or feature (fort, vicus, bath-house) and give clear, specific details—describe the layout of a fort, the purpose of granaries, or what the Vindolanda Tablets record. For explanation questions, link your facts to wider conclusions about the classical world: explain what a supply list from a tablet tells us about army organisation, or how the presence of a bath-house reflects Roman attitudes to hygiene and social life. When asked to compare with the modern world, pick a clear angle—border control, military logistics, or cultural integration—and show both similarities and differences. For example, compare Hadrian’s Wall as a controlled border with modern customs posts, while noting differences in technology, ideology and human rights.

For source evaluation, always identify the type of source and consider its usefulness and limitations. An archaeological feature such as a hypocaust is excellent for revealing technology and daily routine but cannot tell us a person’s thoughts. A Vindolanda Tablet may give a direct voice to an individual, which is invaluable, but it is a fragmentary survival and may not represent everyone’s experience. Use specific examples: cite the birthday invitation from Claudia Severa to show women’s literacy and social networks, or a tablet ordering boots to demonstrate logistic challenges. Explain why each example supports your point and what it cannot tell us.

Structure longer answers using a clear plan: introduce the issue, give detailed evidence with named examples, explain how the evidence supports your points about the classical world, and finish with a brief conclusion that answers the question directly. Time management in a 2-hour paper is important: spend roughly the same proportion of time on each section according to its mark allocation, and leave a few minutes to check your answers. For the assignment, choose a focused topic that allows comparison with today, gather a range of sources including archaeological reports and translated tablets, and prepare a concise resource sheet that highlights your key evidence and references. Remember the production stage is done under controlled conditions, so practise organising your argument and using your resource sheet efficiently before the timed session.

Above all, aim to show curiosity about people’s lives. Use the vivid details from Vindolanda and Hadrian’s Wall to bring answers to life, and always link evidence to broader conclusions about Roman society, military organisation and cultural interaction on the frontier.
