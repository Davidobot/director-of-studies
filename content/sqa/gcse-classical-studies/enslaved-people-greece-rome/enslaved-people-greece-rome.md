# Enslaved people in Greece and Rome (GCSE Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why study slavery in the classical world?
Slavery was a fundamental part of life in classical Greece and Rome and shaped politics, the economy and everyday social relations. For candidates studying National 5 Classical Studies it is important to treat enslaved people not as a single, unchanging category but as individuals whose experiences depended on where they lived, their age, sex, skills and the period in which they lived. Studying slavery helps us understand how households, markets, courts and public life worked in Athens, Pompeii and across the Roman world, and it gives a basis for sensible comparison with modern ideas about freedom, work and human rights.

## How people became enslaved
There were several routes into slavery in the classical world. The most common were capture in war and piracy, where defeated enemies, citizens of conquered communities or those taken by raiders were sold as slaves. Children could be born into slavery when their mother was enslaved. Economic misfortune could also lead to a person’s loss of freedom. In earlier periods and in some places debt slavery occurred, though legal reforms in Athens reduced the formal use of debt bondage by the 5th century BC. In cities such as Athens and in Roman territories, the slave market was a visible part of urban life: people were brought to the agora or forum to be inspected and sold, and traders judged value by age, health, strength, skill and appearance.

## Enslaved people in 5th‑century Athens: work, status and household life
In Athens enslaved people performed a wide range of tasks that supported both private households and public institutions. Within the house, women and men performed domestic tasks: cooking, cleaning, fetching water, spinning and weaving, and supervising younger children. Enslaved women often carried much of the household labour and also managed other enslaved workers. Men worked as craftsmen, potters, metalworkers, shoemakers and labourers; some were employed as attendants in workshops or as rowers and servants on merchant vessels. Agricultural work on estates could be seasonal or year‑round, and in some places slaves worked on larger farms or estates owned by wealthy citizens.

Treatment varied enormously. Skilled or trusted slaves might live in better conditions and receive more autonomy, while unskilled labourers might face hard, physical work. Certain forms of work were particularly harsh and dangerous: mines and quarries were notorious for their brutality and high mortality, and slaves who worked in such places were often treated with extreme severity. The price of a slave at sale depended on many factors: physical strength and stamina for labourers, skills and literacy for specialist jobs, age, health, gender and even appearance. There are literary and legal references that signal these distinctions and allow us to imagine how buyers assessed value.

Enslaved people were not legally citizens. In Athens they had no political rights, could not appear in court as plaintiffs, and their testimony was treated differently from that of citizens. Nevertheless, some could be employed in roles that put them in daily contact with citizens and outsiders, and a few accumulated savings or were entrusted with economic tasks. The possibility of manumission—being freed by an owner—existed, although the social and legal outcomes of freedom differed from place to place.

## Enslaved people in Rome and Pompeii: variety of roles and evidence from the street
Roman slavery was widespread and highly varied. In a town like Pompeii we find abundant archaeological evidence for the many kinds of work carried out by enslaved people. Thermopolia, bakeries, laundries and workshops were often run by enslaved or freed workers. Fullers, who ran laundry and cloth‑cleaning businesses, worked in noisy, smelly conditions, while bakers worked long hours producing bread for the city. Street stalls and shops in the forum relied on enslaved labour for production, sales and service. Wealthy Roman households employed large numbers of domestic slaves: cooks, tutors, child‑carers, personal attendants and managers of the household stores. Some of the most visible public roles were undertaken by enslaved people owned by the state or by municipalities; public slaves performed tasks such as maintaining temples, policing markets and attending to municipal duties.

Gladiators were often slaves or prisoners trained for the arena, and their lives could be short and dangerous, but successful gladiators sometimes achieved fame and even the possibility of manumission. The Roman practice of using enslaved Greek tutors and skilled artisans is a notable feature: Greek‑speaking enslaved people were valued for their education and cultural capital and commonly found roles as teachers, secretaries and doctors in Roman households.

Pompeii provides unique archaeological windows into enslaved life. Texts, graffiti, wall paintings and the plaster casts of victims of Vesuvius show the presence of enslaved workers behind the visible businesses of the town. The physical layout of houses and shops—small quarters above a thermopolium, cramped rooms next to workshops—helps us infer daily routines, privacy or lack of it, and the social status of their occupants.

## Legal status, manumission and family life
Under both Greek and Roman law enslaved people were property rather than holders of legal personhood. Owners could buy and sell them, and the law provided owners considerable control, including disciplinary rights. Within that framework, however, practice was complex. In Rome there developed a legal and social practice of manumission that allowed many enslaved people to be freed by their owners. Freedmen and freedwomen (liberti and libertae) acquired a new legal status: they were not full equals of freeborn citizens but could gain legal rights, work as independent craftsmen or businesspeople, and sometimes amass wealth. A freedman often maintained ties with their former owner, who became a patron, and these patron‑client relationships could be important for social and economic life.

In Athens, manumission happened, but full civic rights for freed slaves were much rarer. Family life was also complicated: enslaved couples might form stable household relationships and raise children, but the legal status of children followed that of the mother, so children born to enslaved mothers remained enslaved. Nonetheless, family networks among enslaved people were important socially, and people created bonds, networks of support and strategies of survival within and beyond the household.

Resistance took many forms. There were individual acts of resistance—running away, sabotage, theft—and collective forms as well. Large scale revolts are better known in particular contexts: Spartan helots in the Peloponnese and later major Roman slave uprisings, such as the rebellion led by Spartacus, show the potential for violent resistance. Everyday resistance, escape and negotiation were common and are attested in literature and inscriptions.

## Sources and how historians reconstruct enslaved lives
Our knowledge of enslaved people comes from a mix of literary sources, legal texts, inscriptions, archaeological remains and material culture. Ancient writers—historians, philosophers, playwrights and satirists—often discuss slavery but usually from the perspective of free citizens, so their accounts can reflect bias. Archaeology supplies a different kind of evidence: domestic architecture, workplaces, the layout of shops, tools and graffiti reveal the practical details of labour and daily life. In Pompeii plaster casts of victims, graffiti naming owners and enslaved people, and the remains of workshops give vivid impressions of who worked where. The Vindolanda tablets on the Roman frontier provide everyday records—orders, lists and letters—that occasionally mention slaves and workers, helping to reconstruct the social fabric of frontier communities.

When using these sources it is important to think about what each kind of evidence can and cannot tell us. Literary texts may moralise or stereotype, inscriptions tend to highlight formal legal or commemorative moments, and archaeological remains show material conditions but not inner thoughts or personal histories. Combining sources allows historians to build a richer, more balanced picture. For National 5 purposes, candidates are expected to show awareness of these strengths and limitations when asked to evaluate usefulness.

## Comparing the classical and modern worlds
Comparisons between classical slavery and modern societies should be careful and specific. In classical Greece and Rome slavery was legal, embedded in the economy and accepted by the political order. Slaves were integral to agriculture, industry, domestic households and public services. By contrast, in most modern societies slavery is illegal and morally condemned, though forms of forced labour, human trafficking and exploitation sadly persist. A useful classroom comparison might focus on the role of forced labour in economies, the rights and legal status of workers, or the social attitudes towards those deprived of liberty. Candidates should avoid simplistic equivalence but can thoughtfully explore similarities (for example how economies depend on unpaid or low‑paid labour) and differences (legal status, possibilities of manumission, public attitudes and the presence of universal human rights in modern law).

It is also important to remember regional and chronological variation within the ancient world. Slavery in Athens differed from the Spartan system of helotry; slavery in the Republic differed from slavery in the imperial Roman household; cities and rural estates presented different experiences. Good comparison recognises this diversity rather than treating the classical world as a single, uniform case.

## Teaching and classroom approaches
Teaching about enslaved people benefits from active, source‑based approaches. Working with short extracts from sources—attic vase scenes, the marketplace descriptions, graffiti from Pompeii or edited passages from playwrights and historians—lets candidates practise source evaluation and build empathy without anachronism. Role‑play or imagined diary entries can help students understand daily routines, while tasks that ask them to explain what a particular source can tell us and what it cannot encourage critical thinking. When setting assignments, encourage students to select topics that allow comparison with modern life and to use a mixture of archaeological and literary evidence. Remind them to pay attention to context: whose voice does a source represent, why was it produced, and what biases might it contain?

## Exam technique
When answering questions about enslaved people, begin by setting the scene briefly: name the place and time (for example “5th‑century Athens” or “Pompeii in the 1st century AD”) and identify the aspect you will discuss. For description questions give clear factual points about how people became enslaved, the kinds of work they did, and the factors that influenced treatment and price. For “explain usefulness” or source evaluation, state what the source reveals and then explore its limitations: literary texts may reflect elite attitudes, inscriptions may be formulaic, and archaeological remains can be silent on personal feelings. When asked to compare with the modern world, choose one or two specific, relevant points of comparison and explain both similarities and differences concisely. Always link your points back to the question, use examples to support general statements (for instance a workshop in Pompeii or references to skilled Greek slaves in Roman households), and end with a short conclusion that sums up your judgement. Practise writing clear paragraphs, avoid unsupported generalisations, and use evidence to back up every claim.
