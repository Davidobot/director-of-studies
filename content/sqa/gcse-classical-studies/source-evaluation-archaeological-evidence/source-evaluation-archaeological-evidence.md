# Source evaluation and archaeological evidence (GCSE Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

Understanding how historians and classical scholars build knowledge about the ancient world is central to Classical Studies. Source evaluation and archaeological evidence are at the heart of this process: they are the tools by which we reconstruct daily life, religion, politics and literature in Greece and Rome, and by which we draw comparisons with the modern world. In the National 5 course you are expected not only to know facts about classical societies, but to explain how those facts are known, to judge the strengths and weaknesses of different kinds of evidence, and to combine archaeological and written sources into reasoned conclusions. This guide explains the main types of evidence you will meet, what archaeological finds can and cannot tell us, how to evaluate written accounts alongside material remains, and how to prepare answers that weigh usefulness and limitations effectively.

## Types of evidence you will meet

Evidence about the classical world comes in two broad families: material remains recovered by archaeologists, and written sources produced by people in the ancient world or later interpreters. Archaeological evidence includes buildings and architectural features, the layout of towns, household objects, tools, jewellery, pottery, coins, inscriptions carved into stone, wall-paintings and graffiti. Exceptional preservation can also give us organic materials such as wood, textiles or food residues in rare cases. Written evidence includes literary works such as Homer’s epics and Greek tragedies, historical accounts such as Thucydides or Pliny, official inscriptions, private letters like the Vindolanda tablets, and later summaries or retellings of stories. Each kind of evidence has particular strengths. Archaeology gives tangible, often everyday details; texts can offer explanations, opinions and narratives, but may be shaped by literary aims, politics or personal bias. A strong revision approach recognises how these types work together: archaeology can test, support or challenge what texts claim, while texts can suggest where to look and how to interpret material finds.

## What archaeological evidence can tell us

Archaeological remains are excellent at revealing routine aspects of life that literary texts often overlook. The plan of a Pompeian house, the layout of a workshop above a thermopolium, or the heating system inside a Roman bath allow us to understand domestic space, economic activity and leisure practices in a concrete way. Finds such as loom weights, pottery shapes and food residues inform us about household production, diet and trade connections; inscriptions and electoral notices painted on walls speak to civic life and public debate; graffiti in Pompeii can show everyday speech, humour, political campaigning or commercial ads. At Vindolanda the discovery of wooden writing tablets has opened an extraordinary window onto soldier’s letters, shopping lists and the social life of a frontier fort. The exceptional preservation at Pompeii, where volcanic ash sealed buildings and organic material, illustrates how particular preservation conditions can create a very detailed snapshot of life at a moment in time.

Archaeology also helps with chronology and economy. Pottery typologies and coin hoards can be dated and used to build sequences of occupation, while the distribution of artefacts and monuments shows where wealth, craft or ritual activity was concentrated. Architectural features such as a lararium (household shrine) or an amphitheatre give direct evidence of religious practice and entertainment. In short, archaeology often provides the concrete, physical evidence that anchors the stories we read in texts.

## Limits and problems of archaeological evidence

Material evidence is powerful but not unproblematic. Preservation bias is a major issue: stone buildings, pottery and metal survive far more readily than textiles, wooden tools or the lives of the poor. Pompeii is spectacular precisely because volcanic ash preserved items that usually decay, which means it is not always representative of everyday Roman towns across the empire. Excavation is destructive: once a site has been dug, it cannot be re-excavated, so careful recording and context (stratigraphy) are crucial. Finds divorced from their context lose much of their value; the position of a pot, an animal bone or a coin in a clearly recorded layer tells us more than the isolated object.

Interpretation depends on modern assumptions. The same wall niche might be read as a shrine by one scholar and as a household cupboard by another, so archaeologists rely on multiple lines of evidence to support interpretations. Sampling and survival also skew our picture: elite houses and public buildings are more likely to be visible and studied, while ephemeral structures and the lives of enslaved or poor people may be under-represented. Finally, dating techniques have margins of error and depend on good excavation practice. A cautious historian always notes these limitations when using archaeological evidence.

## Evaluating written sources alongside archaeology

Written sources are essential but must be read critically. An author’s purpose, audience and context shape what they record. Pliny’s letters about the eruption of Vesuvius, for example, are vivid eyewitness accounts that give stages of the eruption and personal impressions, yet they were written with particular rhetorical aims and for particular readers. Ancient historians may exaggerate, moralise or write to please patrons. Tragedy and epic are literary genres that use plot and character to explore themes such as fate, leadership or conflict, and are not straightforward factual reports of social reality. Nevertheless, texts record beliefs, customs, laws and elite behaviour that archaeology may not capture directly.

A powerful way to evaluate evidence is to ask whose voice the source represents. A senate decree, a poet’s speech or a private soldier’s letter each offers a different perspective. Cross-checking is vital: when archaeological finds corroborate a written account, the combined evidence is stronger. Where they conflict, the discrepancy is informative: it may reveal bias in the text, a local variation in practice, or an earlier stage of change not captured by later writers. Teaching should emphasise that neither type of evidence is superior in itself; rather, their value depends on context, provenance and the question being asked.

## How to judge usefulness and reliability in practice

When asked to evaluate the usefulness of a source, begin by identifying its origin: who produced it, when, where and for what audience? For a pottery sherd, consider the findspot and the wider assemblage; for a literary extract, note the author’s intent and literary conventions. Next, examine content: what information does the source provide, and is that information direct or interpretative? Then assess limitations: what does it omit, who is excluded from this view, and what biases or preservation issues affect it? Finally, consider corroboration: does other archaeological data, inscriptions, or contemporary texts back up the source, contradict it, or fill in gaps?

Use specific examples. A wall painting in a Pompeian dining room showing a mythic scene tells us about elite taste and display, but it cannot alone reveal the real diet of a household; for that, pottery, food residues and kitchen installations are more useful. A Vindolanda tablet listing supplies is invaluable for everyday vocabulary, prices and personal names, but it reflects the frontier context and cannot be taken as typical of Italy. Pliny’s account of Vesuvius is strong for sequence and human reaction to the disaster, while the casts of human victims at Pompeii give immediate physical evidence of positions and buildings occupied at the time of eruption. Evaluations should combine these strengths and limitations to reach a balanced conclusion about what historians can reasonably claim.

## Preparing the assignment and using sources under assessment conditions

The course assignment asks you to choose a topic that allows comparison between the classical and modern worlds and to research it using a set of sources. The assignment grading gives weight to your ability to analyse information, to comment on the usefulness of two sources, and to reach a reasoned conclusion. Practical requirements are important: the resource sheet you submit must be a single side of A4 with no more than 200 words, and failure to include it carries a penalty. The research stage can be extended over approximately eight hours with reasonable guidance from teachers; the production stage is completed under strict supervision in one hour using only the resource sheet. When preparing, select two strong but contrasting sources to evaluate: for example, a literary account such as Pliny’s letter paired with archaeological evidence from the same event (the casts, building plans and ash layers at Pompeii). Practise summarising each source’s origin, content and limitations concisely, and rehearse how you will link them to modern comparisons so you can use your one-hour production time efficiently.

## Exam technique

Answering source and evaluation questions in the exam requires clear structure and timing. For literature questions, remember the three essential tasks: describe examples from the text, explain what those examples tell us about the classical world, and compare that view with the modern world. For source evaluation questions, start by identifying origin and purpose, then explain what the source can tell you, before weighing its limitations and concluding on its overall usefulness. When asked to use archaeological evidence, refer to concrete features — for example, a lararium indicating household worship, a thermopolium showing provision of street food, or a Vindolanda tablet revealing names and everyday orders — and explain how these physical details support your interpretation. Always link each point back to the question rather than providing isolated facts.

Time management is crucial. In a two-hour paper, allocate time proportionally: spend a little longer on higher-mark questions, but keep source-handling steady so you can read and analyse the two required Roman sources. When evaluating, avoid sweeping generalisations; simple, precise judgements tied to evidence score better than long lists of facts. Use short, focused paragraphs that state a point, give the evidence, explain its significance, note the limitation, and then move on. When comparing classical and modern worlds, be specific about which modern practices or societies you mean and why the comparison is apt. Finally, conclude briefly to bring together your evaluation or argument, making clear which source or combination of evidence you found most persuasive and why. Practise this structure in past papers and timed exercises so that in the exam you can present clear, balanced, and well-supported evaluations that reflect both the strengths and the inevitable limits of our surviving evidence.
