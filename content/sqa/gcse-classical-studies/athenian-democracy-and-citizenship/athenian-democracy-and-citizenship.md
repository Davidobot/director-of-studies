# Athenian democracy and citizenship (GCSE Classical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: what kind of democracy was Athens?
Fifth‑century BC Athens practised a form of direct democracy that looks very different from modern representative systems. In Athens political power was exercised in person by a large body of male citizens who met to debate and decide issues that affected the city. There was no professional political class in the modern sense: many important decisions about war, finance, law and public policy were made in communal settings where ordinary citizens could speak and vote. This system developed in the course of the early fifth century and reached its height in the period often called the Golden Age of Athens. The practical effect was that being a citizen meant more than a legal status; it meant participating in public life, fulfilling civic duties and taking part in shared religious and social rituals that bound the city together.

## Who counted as a citizen?
Citizenship in classical Athens was narrowly defined. Full political rights were reserved for adult males who were recognised as Athenians by birth. By the mid‑fifth century BC a law tightened the rules: to be a citizen both parents needed to be of Athenian descent. Citizens typically became eligible to participate in public life in their late teens or at eighteen. Women, enslaved people and resident foreigners (called metics) were excluded from political citizenship. Metics could live and work in the city and were expected to pay taxes and serve in some public roles, but they had no vote and could not hold general offices. Enslaved people had no legal rights at all. The restriction of citizenship had important social consequences: citizenship conferred both privileges and responsibilities, and being excluded from it shaped people’s daily lives in clear ways.

## The institutions of Athenian democracy
The Assembly, or Ekklesia, was the central institution of Athenian democracy. It met on a hill outside the city and later on the Pnyx, where citizens gathered to hear proposals, debate and vote. Any citizen who attended could speak, propose policy, and cast a vote on matters ranging from peace and war to the award of public contracts. Important decisions were often taken by a show of hands or by a counting of votes. Complementing the Assembly were other organs: councils and juries chosen by lot, magistrates who carried out daily administration, and special officials for finance and religious observance. One of the most striking features of Athenian governance was the widespread use of sortition — the selection of office‑holders by lot — which aimed to prevent entrenched elites from monopolising power. Certain posts, such as generals (strategoi), tended to be filled by election because they required special skills, while many other posts rotated among citizens chosen by lot for short terms. The legal system was also a political arena: large citizen juries met in the law courts to hear cases, examine evidence, and impose penalties. Trials were public and political debate often spilled into the courts.

## Rights and responsibilities of citizens
Athenian citizenship brought practical rights: the right to attend and speak in the Assembly, the right to vote, the right to serve on juries and to hold many public offices. These rights were joined by clear responsibilities. Men were expected to serve in the military when required, either as hoplites fighting on land or as rowers and marines in the powerful Athenian navy. Many citizens discharged civic duties such as jury service, which was both an obligation and a way of participating directly in justice. Wealthier citizens also played a public role by funding liturgies, expensive public services such as outfitting a warship or sponsoring dramatic choruses for festivals; although not a formal legal obligation for all, these responsibilities reinforced the link between wealth and public service. Participation in religious festivals like the Panathenaia and the City Dionysia was another civic practice: such festivals were occasions for collective identity where politics, religion and culture merged.

## Exclusion, inequality and social realities
Although the Athenian system gave political power to a broad class of male citizens, it remained highly exclusionary by modern standards. Women, enslaved people and resident foreigners were left outside political decision‑making. Even among male citizens there were inequalities: wealth influenced a man’s ability to attend frequent meetings, to fund liturgies, or to pursue lengthy public service. The day‑to‑day reality of politics also meant that many decisions were shaped by orators, social influence and personal reputation. Mechanisms such as ostracism, a procedure in which citizens could vote to exile an individual for ten years by inscribing a name on a potsherd, were designed to check ambition and prevent the rise of potential tyrants, but they could also be used politically. The law courts were arenas not only of justice but of political competition, with litigants speaking for themselves and persuading large juries without professional legal counsel in the modern sense.

## Sources and how we know about Athenian politics
Our picture of Athenian democracy is built from a mixture of archaeological remains, public inscriptions and literary sources. The Pnyx, the agora and the Theatre of Dionysus are physical sites that help us imagine where citizens met, shopped, worshipped and watched drama. Inscriptions and official decrees carved in stone record laws, honours and some administrative decisions, giving concrete evidence of civic procedure. Literary writers, including historians and dramatists, provide perspectives on how politics looked and felt. Tragedy and comedy, while not straightforward historical records, reveal contemporary attitudes to leaders, law and civic life. When we use sources, it is important to think both about what they tell us and about their limitations. Archaeological evidence can show where people met and what buildings existed, but it cannot speak directly about debates or votes. Literary texts can preserve speeches and opinions, but they reflect particular viewpoints and sometimes exaggerate for dramatic or rhetorical effect. Good historical argument combines different kinds of evidence and is careful to explain how each source helps build a fuller picture.

## Comparing Athens with modern democracies
Comparing Athens with modern democracies is a useful way to understand both similarities and contrasts. The most obvious similarity is the idea that political power belongs to the people rather than a monarch or a small elite. Yet the mechanisms differ sharply: Athens practised direct decision‑making by those citizens who could attend meetings, whereas most modern states use representative institutions where elected officials act on behalf of voters. Modern democracies usually extend the franchise to all adult citizens regardless of gender and do not exclude resident foreigners in the same way. Legal systems differ too: Athenian trials were public performances before very large citizen juries and usually involved self‑representation, while modern systems typically include professional lawyers and codified procedures intended to protect individual rights. Finally, modern democracies tend to separate religion from formal political decision‑making in ways that ancient Greek civic religion did not; festivals, temples and cult practices in Athens were woven into public identity and politics.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Athenian democracy and citizenship, structure and use of precise examples are essential. For ‘describe’ questions begin by setting the scene briefly: name the institution or practice (for example, the Assembly/Ekklesia meeting on the Pnyx) and give concrete details such as who attended, what they decided and how voting took place. For a full five‑mark description move quickly through several clear, focused points illustrated with examples: for instance, explain that male citizens over eighteen could speak and vote in the Assembly, juries were large and chosen by lot, and ostracism used potsherds to exile a person for ten years. For ‘explain’ questions link your description to broader features of the classical world: show how institutions reflected values like civic duty or the fear of concentrated power, and explain the purpose of mechanisms such as sortition or jury service. When asked to compare with the modern world, choose two or three clear points of contrast or similarity — such as direct versus representative democracy, the exclusion of women and non‑citizens in Athens compared with universal suffrage today, or the role of professional lawyers in modern courts — and explain why each difference matters.

If a question includes sources, treat them as evidence to support your argument rather than as ends in themselves. Begin by summarising what the source says in one or two lines, then comment on its usefulness: consider who produced it, when and why, and whether it is a literary or archaeological source. Explain what the source can reliably tell us and what it cannot. For example, an inscription recording a decree is strong evidence for an official decision but tells us little about the debate that produced it; a playwright’s account may reflect public attitudes but can be exaggerated for dramatic effect. Finish by integrating the source with other knowledge: use it to support a point from your description or explanation, and note any limitations that affect how strongly you can rely on it.

Manage your time by allocating minutes roughly in proportion to the marks available and always leave a short period to proofread and make sure your examples are clearly connected to the question stem. Use precise names and terms where you can — Ekklesia, ostracism, metics, juries — and always tie facts back to the main task: describe, explain, compare or evaluate. Clear structure, accurate detail, and careful use of sources will lift a good answer into an excellent one.
