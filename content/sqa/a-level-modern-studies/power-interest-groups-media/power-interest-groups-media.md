# Power, interest groups and the media (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview
Power, interest groups and the media are central to how modern democracies function. Power is not only held by formal institutions such as parliaments and governments but is also exercised by organisations and networks that seek to shape policy, public opinion and political agendas. Interest groups attempt to influence decisions made by elected politicians and civil servants, whereas the media inform, frame and sometimes set the terms of public debate. At Advanced Higher level you are expected to analyse these relationships, to compare how they operate in the UK (including Scotland) with other countries, and to evaluate evidence using social science research methods. Clear examples, careful source evaluation and a sustained line of argument are essential in both the question paper and the project–dissertation.

## Theories of power and influence
Understanding power requires engagement with competing theoretical perspectives. Pluralist theory argues that power is dispersed among many organised groups offering competing access to policymakers, with no one group permanently dominant. Elitist or Marxist perspectives counter that a small number of powerful actors—economic elites, major corporations, or an entrenched political class—wield disproportionate influence, shaping policy to protect their interests. Corporatist models describe structured relationships between the state and major interest organisations, often found in social democracies where trade unions and employer organisations are integrated into policy-making. In practice, combinations of these theories can explain different aspects of influence: for example, pluralist competition may characterise local lobbying while elite capture can explain large-scale economic policy. Always link theory to evidence: use examples to show when pluralism describes reality and when power appears concentrated.

## Interest groups: types, goals and tactics
Interest groups range from small community organisations to international NGOs and professional bodies. Some groups pursue narrow economic interests, such as trade associations or business lobby groups, while others advance public-interest causes like environmental protection or human rights. Insider groups typically cultivate direct access to ministers and civil servants and use formal channels such as consultations, policy briefings and expert committees. Outsider groups rely on mobilisation of public opinion and media campaigns to exert pressure, using demonstrations, petitions, social media activism and strategic litigation. The effectiveness of these tactics depends on resources, expertise and context. For instance, the British Medical Association can influence health policy through expert knowledge and insider access, whereas grassroots movements such as Black Lives Matter influence policy by changing public discourse and increasing media scrutiny. Evaluate influence not simply by rhetoric but by measurable outcomes: policy change, amendments to legislation, shifts in public spending, or alterations to political party manifestos.

## The media: functions, ownership, regulation and digital change
The media perform vital democratic functions: informing citizens, scrutinising power, offering a forum for public debate and enabling accountability. Ownership and regulatory structures shape how these functions are performed. In the UK the public broadcaster (the BBC) is subject to public service obligations, while commercial press markets have concentrated ownership and are driven by circulation and advertising. Regulatory responses to media influence, such as the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics and the role of Ofcom in broadcasting standards, demonstrate political reactions to perceived media excess. The rise of digital media has transformed the landscape: social platforms accelerate the spread of information and disinformation, algorithms shape what users see, and targeted advertising can micro-target voters. High-profile examples such as the Cambridge Analytica controversy illustrate how data-driven campaigns can attempt to influence electoral behaviour. Comparative angles are productive: contrast the relatively regulated broadcasting environment in the UK with the highly partisan cable television environment in the United States, or with countries where state control of media constrains pluralism. When analysing media influence, consider agenda-setting, framing, gatekeeping and the interaction between traditional and new media in shaping public opinion.

## Interactions between media, interest groups and political parties
The relationships between interest groups, media and political parties are interdependent and dynamic. Political parties use media to communicate messages and to mobilise supporters, while media coverage can enhance or damage party reputations. Interest groups may fund advertising campaigns, commission research to feed into media stories, or cultivate specialist journalists to ensure coverage of technical issues. Parties may be influenced by powerful interest groups through donations, policy advice or electoral considerations; the presence of well-funded groups can alter party strategies and priorities. In Scotland, the SNP’s relationship with grassroots activists and civil society on issues such as welfare and constitutional change demonstrates how movements and party politics can align to produce substantial political pressure. Conversely, media partisanship and ownership concentration can skew the public agenda, privileging certain interests over others. Analyse these interactions by tracing specific policy cases: how a group frames an issue, how media coverage amplifies that frame, and how parties respond in terms of rhetoric, manifesto commitments or legislative proposals.

## Comparative examples and case studies
Comparative analysis strengthens answers by showing variation across systems and contexts. Use examples from the UK and at least one other country to demonstrate differences in how power is exercised. In the United States, powerful lobbying groups such as the NRA or large corporate PACs operate within a political finance environment that amplifies their influence, while the partisan media ecosystem (for example, the polarisation of certain cable networks) contributes to ideological sorting and mobilisation. Nordic countries offer contrasts in corporatist policymaking, where trade unions and employer associations are institutional partners in governance, and media systems tend to preserve strong public-service outlets alongside regulated markets. In authoritarian or hybrid regimes, state control of media and suppression of independent civil society limit the influence of interest groups and public debate. Use detailed case studies: the BMA’s impact on NHS policy, Greenpeace’s international campaigns, the role of social media in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, or the Leveson Inquiry’s consequences for press regulation. Effective comparisons address both similarities and differences, and they explain why different institutional arrangements produce different patterns of influence.

## Research methods and evaluating sources in this topic
Robust understanding of power, interest groups and the media depends on sound research methods. Common methods include analysis of official statistics, opinion polls, surveys, interviews, focus groups, content analysis of media output, case studies and longitudinal studies. Each method has strengths and limitations. Surveys and polls can measure public attitudes and track change over time, but they require careful sampling and attention to question wording. Content analysis reveals patterns in media coverage and framing but must be systematic and transparent to avoid researcher bias. Interviews and focus groups offer depth and insight into motivations but are less generalisable. Case studies are useful for rich, contextual analysis, while longitudinal research can demonstrate trends and causal relationships over extended periods. Ethical issues are particularly salient when researching contentious political topics: informed consent, protection of vulnerable participants, anonymisation of data and transparency about funding and purpose all matter. When evaluating sources, consider provenance, methodology, date, funding and intended audience. Official statistics are valuable but may be limited by definitions or measurement errors; media reports can be timely but partisan; think-tank research often reflects particular normative perspectives. Triangulation—using multiple methods and sources—strengthens claims and helps identify bias.

## Teaching and classroom applications
In the classroom, this topic lends itself to enquiry-based learning that develops analytical and research skills. Encourage students to trace a policy issue from interest-group advocacy to media coverage to political response, using primary sources such as press releases, parliamentary records and news articles. Simulated lobbying exercises or role-play debates can illuminate the tactical choices of different actors and the constraints they face. Content analysis exercises, where students code and compare coverage of the same event across different outlets, sharpen source-evaluation skills and understanding of framing. Project work that requires a comparative element—choosing a second country to contrast with the UK—builds synthesis and judgement. Teachers should emphasise the importance of up-to-date, relevant examples and the need to reference the origin of evidence in essays. When preparing students for the project–dissertation, guide them to formulate research questions using stems such as “To what extent…?” or “How far…?”, and to select methods that are feasible within the guidance on supervision and word count.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on power, interest groups and the media requires clarity of argument, relevant examples, comparative awareness and careful source use. For 30-mark extended-response questions, begin by planning a clear line of argument and a structure that addresses the question directly. Introduce the issue with a concise definition and the scope of your comparison, then develop analytical paragraphs that integrate theory, evidence and counter-argument. Where the question asks for reference to the UK or Scotland and other countries, ensure you make explicit comparative points throughout rather than adding a brief comparative paragraph at the end. Use precise contemporary examples to illustrate claims and, in your conclusion, return to the question with a sustained judgement that weighs the evidence. For the two 15-mark research-methods questions, assess the suitability of the method(s) in the context supplied, discussing reliability, validity, ethical constraints and likely problems such as sampling or response bias, and suggest credible alternatives or ways to strengthen the research. For the 15-mark source trustworthiness question, interrogate provenance, purpose, methodology and corroboration; ask who produced the source, why, when and what other evidence confirms or contradicts it. In the project–dissertation, choose a focused, contemporary research question that allows for analysis and evaluation within the 5,000-word limit. Justify your choice, explain and evaluate your methods, discuss ethical considerations and use a range of sources. Present appendices that document primary research and ensure any material in appendices is explicitly used in the main text. Reference consistently, keep within the word limit, and produce a conclusion that makes a balanced, evidence-based judgement rather than merely summarising. Above all, avoid rote answers: adapt knowledge to the specific wording of the question, show critical thinking, and use comparison and method evaluation where appropriate to demonstrate Advanced Higher level skills.
