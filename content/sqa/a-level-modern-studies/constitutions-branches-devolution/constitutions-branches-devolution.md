# Constitutions, branches and devolution (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction
Understanding constitutions, the branches of government and devolution is central to making sense of how political power is organised and exercised in the United Kingdom and in Scotland. This topic asks you to combine factual knowledge with analytical skills: you must be able to explain key concepts such as codified and uncodified constitutions, describe how the legislative, executive and judicial branches relate to one another, and assess the strengths, limits and contemporary challenges of the UK’s devolved arrangements. Successful answers bring together theory, contemporary examples and clear evaluation—drawing on case studies such as the Scotland Acts, the 2014 independence referendum, Supreme Court rulings and intergovernmental disputes.

## Constitutions: codified and uncodified
A constitution defines how political power is distributed, the limits on that power, and the basic rights of citizens. Constitutions can be codified, as a single written text (for example the United States Constitution), or uncodified, made up of statutes, conventions, judicial decisions and constitutional documents (for example the UK). The UK’s uncodified constitution means that key rules are flexible and can evolve through Acts of Parliament, judicial interpretation and established practice. This flexibility allows adaptation but also makes the protection of rights and the limits on government less rigid than in countries with constitutional supremacy. Important concepts to grasp are parliamentary sovereignty—the principle that Parliament can make or unmake any law—and the rule of law, which requires that government acts within the law and that individuals have legal protections. Understanding the tensions between parliamentary sovereignty and protections such as human rights is essential when evaluating constitutional arrangements.

## The branches of government and their relationships
Modern democratic systems organise power into branches to provide checks and balances. The legislative branch makes laws, the executive implements them, and the judiciary interprets the law. In the UK these roles overlap in distinctive ways. The executive (the Prime Minister and Cabinet, or in Scotland the First Minister and Scottish Government) is drawn from the legislature and depends on parliamentary support, which means there is a fusion of powers rather than the strict separation seen in presidential systems. The monarchy retains formal constitutional roles, exercised in practice on ministerial advice. The judiciary is independent and can review whether public bodies act within the law; since the creation of the Supreme Court in 2009, senior judicial review of government action has greater visibility. Court decisions such as those on prorogation and on the effects of Brexit demonstrated that judges can and do constrain executive action where legal limits are breached. However, in the UK courts do not generally strike down primary legislation made by Parliament, reflecting the enduring principle of parliamentary sovereignty.

## Devolution: origins and the Scottish settlement
Devolution in the UK began in earnest after the 1997 referendums, resulting in the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Senedd and a reformed Northern Ireland Assembly. Devolution is asymmetric: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have different powers, institutional designs and political histories. The Scotland Act 1998 established the Scottish Parliament with legislative competence over matters such as health, education, justice and transport, with reserved matters like defence, foreign policy and most of taxation remaining with Westminster. Later Scotland Acts, notably in 2012 and 2016, enhanced devolved powers and introduced fiscal tools such as varying rates of income tax for Scotland and control over certain taxes (for example Land and Buildings Transaction Tax and Scottish landfill tax), together with new welfare-related powers. Devolution is based on statutes and conventions rather than a single constitutional settlement, which means the limits and practical operation of devolved powers are often contested and subject to negotiation.

## How devolution works in practice: consent, competence and dispute
Devolution relies on a mixture of legal rules and political practices. The competence of the Scottish Parliament is defined in statute and is enforceable by the courts: if a Scottish Act exceeds devolved competence it can be declared outwith competence. The Sewel Convention, which holds that Westminster will not normally legislate on devolved matters without the consent of the devolved legislature, is politically important but not legally enforceable. Intergovernmental mechanisms such as the Joint Ministerial Committee are intended to manage relations between the UK Government and devolved administrations, but clashes over policy or constitutional direction are frequent. Practical examples include disputes about welfare powers, the handling of Brexit-related matters, and disagreements over the use of reserved prerogative powers. Devolution has also raised questions about parliamentary sovereignty at a UK level: if devolved legislatures acquire substantial democratic legitimacy, what limits should there be on Westminster’s ability to legislate for devolved matters?

## Accountability, checks and judicial review
Accountability in the UK system takes many forms. Elected legislatures hold executives to account through questions, debates, committee scrutiny and votes. In Scotland, Holyrood committees play an important role in selecting legislation and scrutinising ministers. The judiciary provides a legal check: courts can interpret statutes, assess whether public bodies have acted lawfully, and determine the competence of devolved legislation. Landmark judicial interventions demonstrate judicial oversight of executive power, but they do not override parliamentary legislation. The balance between democratic decision-making and judicial protection of rights is a live debate: supporters argue that judicial review safeguards citizens against unlawful government action, while critics warn of judicial overreach into political questions. Understanding specific mechanisms—such as the power of the Supreme Court to rule on devolution issues, and the role of judicial review in enforcing administrative law—is central to analysing how branches interact.

## Comparative perspectives and constitutional change
Comparing the UK with other systems sharpens understanding. Federal systems such as the United States and Germany enshrine the division of powers in a codified constitution and provide constitutional courts with the authority to strike down federal laws that breach the constitution. The UK’s devolution is different: it is statutory, asymmetrical and more easily altered by Parliament. This creates advantages in flexibility and adaptability but risks political uncertainty and contestation, particularly when devolved governments have distinct political priorities. Constitutional change in the UK has often come through referendums and political negotiation: the 1997 devolution referendums, the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and the multiple Scotland Acts are examples. The broader debate about whether the UK should adopt a codified constitution, or move toward federalism, is an ongoing political issue tied to identity, practical governance and questions of democratic legitimacy.

## Teaching and classroom examples
To build deep understanding, use case studies and current events. The 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the 2016 and 2019 Supreme Court cases relating to Brexit and prorogation, and the incremental extension of fiscal powers to Scotland through the Scotland Acts are rich sources for analysis. Classroom activities that work well include timed essays on how judicial review constrains the executive, structured debates on whether the UK should adopt a codified constitution, and research projects comparing the UK’s devolution with federal systems abroad. When exploring devolution, trace specific policy areas—health, education or justice—in both Scotland and Westminster to show how different decision-making leads to different outcomes and political conflicts. Encouraging students to follow recent intergovernmental disputes and to read primary documents such as Acts of Parliament and judicial judgments helps link theory with real-world practice.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on constitutions, branches and devolution, begin by defining key terms concisely and accurately: explain what a constitution does, distinguish codified from uncodified systems, and state what devolution means in the UK context. For extended-response essays, plan a clear line of argument and organise paragraphs so each contributes evidence or analysis toward that argument. Use up-to-date and specific examples to illustrate points: name Acts (for example the Scotland Acts), cite landmark court cases or referendums, and explain how these examples support your evaluation. In comparative questions, make explicit links between the UK and at least one other country, noting similarities and differences and assessing their significance rather than merely listing features. In questions about the branches of government, show understanding of the fusion of powers in the UK, but also evaluate how mechanisms such as judicial review, parliamentary scrutiny and devolution create checks and balances in practice. For source-based or research-methods questions include consideration of provenance, purpose, and methodological limitations; if asked to evaluate trustworthiness, assess sampling, bias, date and context as well as the document’s origin. For the project–dissertation choose a contemporary, well-bounded question phrased to allow judgement—stems such as “To what extent…” or “How far…” work well—use a range of sources, critically evaluate the methods used, address ethical issues where relevant, and ensure appendices are explicitly referenced in the text. Always conclude with a developed judgement that answers the precise question, balancing evidence and theory. Time-management in the three-hour paper is essential: allocate time to plan, write and proofread, and ensure marks are reflected in the depth of your answer.
