# Research methods and source evaluation (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Why research methods matter in Modern Studies
Understanding research methods is central to Advanced Higher Modern Studies because the subject is not only about facts and theories but about how we know what we claim to know. Whether you are comparing political influence in the UK with another country, analysing causes of crime, or investigating patterns of social inequality, the strength of your arguments depends on the quality of the evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to gather it. Good research methods let you move from description to explanation and judgement: they help you justify why a source is trustworthy, why a survey result can be generalised, and why a particular research design is better suited to a given question. In the context of assessments you will be expected to choose, evaluate and apply methods, to synthesise evidence from different types of sources, and to draw reasoned conclusions that are rooted in an understanding of research strengths and limitations.

## Quantitative approaches: official statistics, surveys and longitudinal studies
Quantitative methods produce numerical data and are often used to measure phenomena, identify trends, and compare groups. Official statistics, such as crime rates, unemployment figures or health waiting times, provide large-scale, routinely collected data that are invaluable for national and international comparison. Yet they are not neutral: definitions change over time, recording practices vary, and under‑reporting can leave a substantial “dark figure” of unrecorded events. Surveys, whether postal, telephone or online, are flexible tools for collecting large samples of individual responses. The mode of delivery affects who responds and how. Postal surveys often have low response rates and skew towards older or more literate respondents; telephone surveys depend on sampling frames and may under-represent mobile-only or hard-to-reach groups; online surveys can be cost-effective but are prone to self-selection bias if respondents are not randomly recruited. Sampling decisions determine representativeness: a random or stratified sample supports more confident generalisation than a convenience sample. Longitudinal studies track the same individuals over time, offering powerful insights into causal processes and change, but they require substantial resources and are vulnerable to attrition. When you evaluate quantitative evidence in essays or the project, discuss how sampling, measurement, and changes in definitions affect reliability and validity, and consider how numbers are presented—raw counts, rates per population, or trends—because presentation influences interpretation.

## Qualitative approaches: interviews, focus groups, observation and case studies
Qualitative methods explore meanings, motivations and processes rather than producing large-scale numerical claims. Structured, semi-structured and unstructured interviews each have a role. Structured interviews standardise questions for easier comparison; semi-structured interviews balance comparability with flexibility; unstructured interviews allow respondents to shape the narrative and reveal unexpected themes. Focus groups stimulate discussion and reveal how opinions form in social settings, but group dynamics can suppress minority views. Observation can be overt, where participants know they are observed, or covert, where they do not; overt observation risks changing behaviour through the Hawthorne effect, while covert observation raises serious ethical concerns. Case studies and ethnographies provide thick description of contexts that can illuminate broader patterns, especially when combined with other methods. The main strengths of qualitative work are depth and the ability to generate hypotheses and explanations; the main weaknesses are issues of representativeness and subjectivity. In assessment you should be able to explain how qualitative data illuminate the “how” and “why” behind quantitative patterns and to suggest ways of corroborating qualitative claims, for example through triangulation with statistics or additional interviews.

## Evaluating sources: provenance, purpose, perspective and trustworthiness
Evaluating a source means moving beyond its face value to test how far it can be relied on as evidence. Start by considering provenance: who produced the source, when, and for what audience? A government report, academic journal article, media output, think-tank briefing or blog post all reflect different purposes and pressures. Purpose affects content: a campaign leaflet aims to persuade, a government report may be constrained by political priorities, and an independent academic study is expected to adhere to methodological standards. Perspective and potential bias matter: funding sources, institutional affiliations and editorial lines can shape which evidence is presented and how. Methodological transparency is a key clue to trustworthiness. A source that explains sampling, data collection and limitations is more trustworthy than one that makes assertions without methodological detail. Cross-checking or corroboration strengthens confidence: similar findings from multiple independent sources reduce the likelihood that results are artefacts of a single methodology. You should also attend to currency: how old is the data and does that matter for the question you are addressing? When evaluating media or virtual outputs, consider how headlines, selective quoting and image choices might over-simplify or sensationalise. In source-based exam questions, explicit reference to provenance, purpose, methodology and corroboration will lift your evaluation from descriptive to analytical.

## Reliability, validity, bias and triangulation
Three technical ideas recur in research evaluation: reliability, validity and bias. Reliability concerns whether a method produces consistent results if repeated. Validity concerns whether the method actually measures what it claims to measure. Bias arises when a study systematically over- or under-estimates an effect because of sampling, question wording, researcher assumptions, or institutional incentives. For example, a survey that uses leading questions will produce biased estimates of public opinion; police recorded crime rates may be reliable in the sense of consistent recording practices but lack validity as measures of true crime prevalence. Triangulation is a practical strategy: combining different methods or data sources to check whether they point in the same direction. A mixed-methods approach might pair national statistics with victim surveys and interviews with practitioners, offering a more robust picture than any single source. In essays and dissertations, clear discussion of how reliability and validity are affected and how triangulation has been, or could be, used to address weaknesses will demonstrate methodological maturity.

## Ethical and practical considerations in social research
Ethical practice is not optional; it shapes what methods are appropriate and how findings are presented. Researchers must consider consent, confidentiality, anonymity and the potential for harm. Working with vulnerable groups, conducting covert observation, or publishing identifiable interview material all require careful judgement and usually formal approval. Data protection and secure storage are practical necessities when collecting personal data. When candidates prepare a project–dissertation they should plan for supervision checkpoints and keep clear records of contacts, consent forms and data handling procedures. Practical constraints also influence method choice: time, funding, access to participants and the availability of secondary data will all shape feasible designs. Teachers should scaffold independence by advising on realistic research designs and by monitoring progress without providing excessive assistance. When you evaluate methods you should weigh ethical and practical feasibility alongside theoretical appropriateness.

## Project–dissertation: planning, evidence and presentation
The project–dissertation is your opportunity to demonstrate independent research skills. Select a contemporary and focused question that lends itself to the methods you can realistically deploy. Good research questions tend to start with stems such as “To what extent…”, “How far…”, or “How and why…”, and avoid vague aims like “to find out”. A successful project justifies the topic, explains method choice, evaluates methods used, incorporates a wide range of sources, and synthesises evidence into a coherent argument that reaches a balanced conclusion. Primary research is not required but can enrich an investigation; if you include surveys or interviews, be explicit about sampling and ethical safeguards. Appendices are important: interview transcripts, survey instruments, and raw data are evidence of research processes, but marks are only gained when appendices are referenced and analysed in the main text. Follow consistent referencing conventions and ensure the main body of the dissertation stays within the 5,000-word limit, while including a word count. Present your work clearly with an introduction that sets the question and structure, a methods section that justifies choices and addresses limitations, analytical chapters that synthesise evidence, and a conclusion that offers a supported judgement about the research question.

## Exam technique
In timed exams you must manage knowledge, method and evaluation under pressure. Read each question carefully and make sure your answer fits the precise wording; avoid relying on pre-prepared essays that do not address the question’s demands. For 30-mark extended responses plan before you write: a brief outline, two or three developed analytical paragraphs that combine theory with up-to-date examples, and a clear, evaluative conclusion that answers the question directly. Use comparative material where required and make explicit links between the UK (or Scotland) and other countries chosen. For the 15-mark methods question consider the suitability of the stated method for the scenario, highlight ethical issues and suggest realistic improvements or alternatives. For source-based questions assess provenance, methodology, date and purpose, and triangulate with other evidence or your own research experience to judge trustworthiness. Time allocation is crucial: leave minutes to plan and to proofread, and make sure the strongest evidence appears early in each answer. Demonstrating an ability to evaluate methods in context, to weigh strengths and weaknesses, and to reach a reasoned conclusion will distinguish high-scoring responses.
