# Social inequality: income, health and policy responses (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: understanding social inequality
Social inequality describes the uneven distribution of resources, opportunities and outcomes across society. In Modern Studies this topic focuses on income and wealth differences, the uneven distribution of health outcomes, and how governments and other actors attempt to reduce these gaps. Inequality is not a single fact to learn but a set of relationships: who benefits, who is excluded, and why. It is helpful to think of inequality both as a measure (for example, differences in wages or life expectancy) and as a political problem that produces debates about state responsibility, individual choice, fairness and efficiency. Studying social inequality for Higher Modern Studies means: being able to explain causes, describe impacts on different groups, evaluate policies, and use evidence from a range of sources to support conclusions.

## Measuring income and wealth inequality in the UK
Income and wealth are related but distinct. Income typically refers to wages, benefits and pensions received over a period; wealth refers to accumulated assets such as property, savings and investments. Different measures give different perspectives. Median income shows what a ‘typical’ household earns, while income deciles or quintiles show the spread from poorest to richest. The Gini coefficient is a common summary measure of inequality: a higher Gini indicates greater inequality. Poverty can be measured in absolute terms (below a fixed threshold) or in relative terms (for example, households with income below 60% of median income).

In the UK, long-term trends since the late twentieth century show a rise in income and especially wealth inequality, reflecting wage disparities, housing price increases and unequal returns to assets. Shorter-term events, such as economic downturns, austerity policies and public health crises, have affected levels of income and the risk of poverty for particular groups. For a Modern Studies answer, you should be able to describe these measures, explain what they show about different parts of the population, and use up-to-date examples to illustrate trends.

## Causes of income and wealth inequality
Explaining why inequality exists requires looking at structural and individual factors. Labour market changes are central: the decline of highly unionised, well-paid manual industries, the rise of part-time and insecure work, and the growing rewards to high-skilled professions have widened income gaps. Educational inequalities reproduce advantage because better-qualified people generally secure higher pay. Housing markets and property ownership are key drivers of wealth differences: rising house prices disproportionately benefit older and property-owning households.

Institutional and policy choices matter too. Tax and benefit systems redistribute income; when taxation is less progressive or welfare is retrenched, inequality tends to rise. Globalisation and technological change increase returns to capital and high skills, raising the incomes of those with capital or expertise. Discrimination based on gender, ethnicity or disability means some groups face barriers to employment and promotion, worsening inequality. Family background and intergenerational inheritance transmit advantage across generations, and access to networks, finance and information amplifies these effects.

When explaining causes in essays, link structural forces to outcomes and give specific evidence: for example, how housing market inflation has increased wealth differences between homeowners and renters, or how labour market flexibility has created a larger low-pay sector.

## Health inequalities: causes, measures and consequences
Health inequality refers to systematic differences in health status between different groups. Common measures include life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, infant mortality and prevalence of chronic conditions. In the UK, health outcomes vary substantially by socioeconomic status, geography and ethnicity. People in the poorest areas typically experience lower life expectancy, higher rates of long-term illness and poorer mental health.

The causes of health inequality are often described as the social determinants of health: income and material conditions (quality of housing, ability to buy nutritious food), employment and working conditions, education, access to health services, environment and psychosocial stress. Behaviours such as smoking or alcohol consumption play a role, but they are shaped by the broader social context: poverty increases the risk of harmful behaviours and reduces the options for healthy living.

Health inequalities have wide consequences. At an individual level they reduce quality of life and increase health costs. At a societal level they impose economic costs through lost productivity and greater demands on health and social care services. Politically, stark health gaps can undermine claims about fair opportunity and social cohesion. When writing about health inequality, make sure to explain mechanisms (for example, how insecure housing can lead to respiratory illness, which then reduces employment prospects), and to link health outcomes to broader social and economic policy.

## Who is affected: groups, intersectionality and life chances
Inequality does not affect everyone equally. Children in low-income families face higher risks of poor educational attainment and health problems, and child poverty can set patterns for adulthood. Older people without adequate pensions or property wealth can be vulnerable to cost-of-living shocks. Ethnic minorities often face double disadvantage due to labour market discrimination and concentrated poverty. Women experience specific income gaps through the gender pay gap, caring responsibilities and pension shortfalls. Disabled people encounter additional barriers in both employment and access to services.

The concept of intersectionality is useful: different identities and disadvantages combine to produce unique experiences of inequality. For example, an ethnic minority woman on a low income may face obstacles related to gender, race and class simultaneously. When analysing effects, consider both immediate consequences (poverty, poor health) and longer-term impacts on life chances such as education pathways, housing stability and political participation. This approach strengthens arguments in essays and assignments by showing complexity rather than treating groups in isolation.

## Policy responses: ideas, instruments and examples in the UK and Scotland
Responses to inequality fall broadly into two traditions. The individualist approach emphasizes market solutions, incentives and personal responsibility, with limited state intervention; policies associated with this view include tax reductions, reliance on private provision and benefits designed to target the most needy. The collectivist approach supports more state intervention to redistribute income and provide universal services to reduce social risks; policies include progressive taxation, generous welfare provision and public services such as the NHS.

In practice, the UK and devolved governments use a mix of instruments. At UK level, policies such as the National Minimum Wage (now the National Living Wage for those over a threshold age), tax credits, Universal Credit and income tax rates shape incomes directly. Public spending on health and education and regulation of housing markets also influence outcomes. The Scottish Government, with devolved powers over many social policies, has taken distinct approaches in some areas: for example, free prescriptions and initiatives such as the Scottish Child Payment aim to reduce child poverty. Scotland has also experimented with broader anti-poverty policies and has powers over certain tax rates in devolved bands.

Other policy tools include active labour market policies (training, apprenticeships), housing interventions (increasing social housing or regulating private rents), and targeted public health measures (smoking bans, sugar levy, vaccination programmes). Non-state actors—charities, trade unions and community organisations—also play a role in alleviating immediate hardship and advocating for structural change.

When evaluating policy, consider design features: universality versus targeting, short-term relief versus long-term structural reform, and whether policies address root causes (education, labour markets) or symptoms (immediate income support). Also consider political feasibility, fiscal constraints and unintended effects, such as benefit conditionality that may push people into insecure work without improving living standards.

## Evaluating policy effectiveness and trade-offs
Judging whether policies reduce inequality requires evidence about outcomes and an understanding of trade-offs. Universal programmes can build broad public support and avoid stigma, but they may be costly and less targeted at those in deepest need. Targeted benefits concentrate resources but can create cliff edges and exclude those just above thresholds. Progressive taxation redistributes income but may be constrained by political choices and economic effects on incentives.

Effectiveness also depends on scale and coherence. Small increases in minimum income help low-paid households, but without affordable housing or accessible childcare the gains are fragile. Health improvements require cross-cutting action: clinical services matter, but so do housing, education and employment policies. Short-term emergency measures—such as extra benefits during a recession or pandemic—can reduce immediate hardship, yet lasting reductions in inequality often require sustained investment in early years, education, skills and employment.

In evaluating, use a combination of quantitative and qualitative evidence. Quantitative data can show changes in poverty rates, life expectancy gaps or employment patterns; qualitative research can reveal lived experiences and barriers to access. Be aware of time lags: many redistributive policies only show effects over years or decades. Finally, consider political context: devolution gives Scotland tools to act on some levers, but fiscal constraints and reserved powers mean trade-offs and the need for coordination across levels of government.

## Exam technique
To succeed in Higher Modern Studies on this topic, match the skills the assessment requires: clear factual knowledge, analysis, evaluation and the ability to use sources in question paper 2 and to research and argue in the assignment. For 12- and 20-mark extended-response questions, begin with a brief definition to frame your answer, then explain causes or describe policies with specific evidence, and develop analysis that links cause to effect. For higher marks include evaluation that weighs alternatives, considers evidence and reaches a balanced conclusion. Structure your answer so each paragraph has a clear point, explanation and supporting example.

For source-based questions, use the sources as your primary evidence. When assessing objectivity or reliability, refer directly to the provenance, date, purpose and tone of each source and compare them. An overall conclusion must be supported by comparisons across sources, not just background knowledge. In accuracy questions give a quantitative judgement such as ‘largely accurate’ and back this up with the most convincing source-based evidence. Remember that in source questions the examiner is assessing how well you use the given sources.

For the assignment, choose a contemporary issue with clear alternatives so you can reach a supported decision. Use your two-sided research sheet effectively: list full references, key facts, and specific source details you will quote in your write-up, but do not include a pre-prepared essay or full analysis on the sheet. During the controlled write-up, make explicit use of the sources on your sheet, evaluate their reliability, present knowledge to frame your argument, analyse and synthesise evidence, and end with a clear, justified decision which recognises counter-arguments.

Practice writing under timed conditions to build the ability to plan and structure responses within the time limits. When answering, keep the question wording in mind: avoid rehearsed generic essays that do not address the specific question. Use contemporary and local examples where appropriate, and when making evaluative points consider policy aims, scale, evidence of impact and political feasibility. Finally, review model answers and specimen papers to internalise the level of detail and the balance of knowledge, analysis and evaluation expected at Higher level.
