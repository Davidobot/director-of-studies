# Electoral systems and voting behaviour (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why electoral systems and voting behaviour matter
Electoral systems and voting behaviour sit at the heart of democratic politics. The way votes are translated into seats shapes who governs, how governments form, which policies are pursued and how citizens feel represented. Voting behaviour explains why people support particular parties or candidates and how long-term factors such as class or short-term forces such as media coverage influence outcomes. For students of Modern Studies, understanding these topics means appreciating not only the technical features of voting systems but also the social and political forces that give elections their meaning. This chapter brings together the main systems used in the UK and other democracies, explains their effects on representation and party systems, explores the social patterns that drive voters’ choices, and offers guidance on how to use examples effectively in assessment.

## Types of electoral systems and their strengths and weaknesses
Electoral systems can be broadly grouped into majoritarian (winner-takes-all) systems and proportional systems, with hybrid forms combining elements of both. First Past the Post (FPTP) is the majoritarian system used for UK general elections. In FPTP the candidate with the most votes in a single-member constituency wins the seat. This system is simple and often delivers single-party majority governments, which supporters argue produces stable, decisive government. Critics point to its tendency to exaggerate the representation of the largest parties and to under-represent smaller parties and geographically dispersed support, producing outcomes that are not proportional to votes cast.

Proportional representation (PR) systems aim to match a party’s share of seats to its share of the vote. Variants include party list systems used in many European countries and Single Transferable Vote (STV), which is used for local government elections in Scotland and for Northern Ireland’s Assembly elections. STV allows voters to rank candidates in multi-member constituencies, which encourages choice within and between parties and typically produces proportional outcomes and more diverse representation.

Hybrid systems combine constituency representation with proportional correction. The Additional Member System (AMS) used for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Senedd gives voters a constituency MSP chosen under FPTP and a regional list vote that top-ups seats to improve proportionality. AMS seeks to balance constituency ties with proportional fairness, though its proportionality depends on the size of regions and the interaction between constituency and list results.

Each system can be evaluated against common criteria: representativeness, choice, fairness, simplicity and the likelihood of producing stable government. FPTP scores highly on simplicity and the potential for clear majorities but poorly on proportionality. PR systems are fairer in seat allocation and encourage multi-party representation, but they can lead to coalition governments and greater complexity for voters. AMS tries to mediate these trade-offs, offering a mixed picture of accountability and proportionality.

## How electoral systems shape political outcomes and party systems
Electoral systems do more than count votes; they shape the party system itself. Duverger’s Law describes the tendency for single-member plurality systems like FPTP to favour a two-party system, because voters avoid wasting votes on smaller parties and parties coalesce to maximise chances of winning constituencies. In practice the UK retains multiple parties, but FPTP has historically advantaged larger parties and concentrated regional parties that have strong local concentrations of support.

Proportional systems foster multi-party politics, influencing coalition-building, policy negotiation and government stability. Countries with PR systems frequently experience coalition governments where compromise is routine. Hybrid systems such as AMS encourage both constituency-focused campaigning and national or regional party strategy aimed at list votes, leading parties to balance local appeals with broader policy platforms.

The choice of system also affects representation of women and minority groups. Proportional systems and party lists often encourage parties to present balanced candidate lists, which can increase descriptive representation. In FPTP, party selection decisions and local incumbency can make progress slower. The 2015 UK general election illustrated how distribution of support matters: a party with concentrated regional strength can win many seats with a modest national vote share, while a party with dispersed support may gain significant votes but few seats. This interaction explains why electoral reform debates—on grounds of fairness, stability and voter choice—remain politically charged.

## Factors influencing voting behaviour: long-term and short-term causes
Voting behaviour is shaped by a mixture of long-term social factors and short-term events. Traditional explanations emphasise social class, with working-class voters historically supporting labour or left-of-centre parties and middle-class voters supporting conservative parties. Over recent decades class dealignment has weakened the automatic link between class and party, partly because of social change, economic shifts and the declining salience of class-based identities.

Age is an increasingly important predictor of voting patterns. Recent referendums and elections have shown younger voters tending towards more liberal or progressive positions, while older cohorts have been more likely to support conservative or nationalist options. Education, occupation, ethnicity and religion also interplay with region and gender to create complex voting profiles across the electorate.

Short-term factors include party leaders’ appeal, the state of the economy, specific campaign issues and events such as scandals or crises. The media environment plays a major role in shaping perceptions. Traditional broadcast and print media still influence agenda-setting and leader images, but social media and targeted online advertising have transformed how parties reach specific groups and how misinformation can spread. Tactical voting emerges when voters choose the candidate most likely to defeat an undesired opponent, and turnout differences between demographic groups can materially alter outcomes.

Understanding voting behaviour therefore requires combining sociological explanations with analysis of campaign dynamics, media effects and the institutional incentives created by different electoral systems.

## Participation, pressure groups and routes to influence
Voting is only one form of political participation. Citizens influence government through pressure groups, protests, petitions, correspondence with representatives and participation in party politics. Pressure groups vary from insider organisations that consult regularly with policymakers to outsider groups that rely on public campaigns, media pressure and direct action. Their effectiveness depends on resources, public salience of the issue, access to decision-makers and the wider political context.

The media functions as both an arena for debate and a powerful intermediary between citizens and politicians, shaping public perceptions of issues and framing political narratives. Campaign techniques, from grassroots canvassing to micro-targeted online adverts, can mobilise supporters and shape turnout. Citizens also influence policy through institutional mechanisms such as petitions, public consultations and local meetings with councillors, while devolved institutions like the Scottish Parliament provide additional arenas for civic engagement on issues that matter to Scots in particular.

For Modern Studies students, recognising the variety of participation allows fuller evaluation of democratic health. A well-functioning democracy is not only one where votes translate fairly into seats, but also where citizens have meaningful, diverse avenues to influence public decision-making beyond election day.

## Contemporary examples and comparative context
Examples make these concepts tangible. The Scottish Parliament’s use of AMS shows how mixed systems can improve proportionality while retaining constituency links; the list element has helped smaller parties gain representation and has altered coalition and government dynamics in Holyrood. The Brexit referendum demonstrated the power of single-issue campaigns and the salience of age and education in voting patterns: younger voters predominantly supported Remain while older cohorts tended to support Leave. The 2015 Westminster election highlighted how FPTP can distort representation, with a party enjoying concentrated regional support winning a large share of seats relative to its national vote share.

Comparative study sharpens understanding. The United States combines plurality elections with an Electoral College in presidential contests, producing unique strategic incentives, while many European democracies use proportional lists that encourage multi-party systems and coalition governments. These contrasts help explain why issues such as accountability, stability and representation are debated differently across systems and why electoral reform proposals attract both normative and pragmatic arguments.

When using examples in assessment, choose recent, directly relevant cases and explain their connection to the point you are making. Contextualise facts rather than merely listing them, and show how an example illustrates a broader principle such as disproportionality or media influence.

## Exam technique
Answering Modern Studies questions well requires precision, evidence and evaluation. For extended-response questions worth 12 or 20 marks, begin with a brief plan that identifies the focus of the question and the line of argument you will pursue. Use relevant, up-to-date examples to support each point, but always tie evidence back to the question rather than offering a general essay. For 20-mark responses aim to develop balanced analysis and clear evaluation. Open with a concise introduction that sets out the argument, develop two or three well-supported points with explanation and evidence, consider counter-arguments or limitations, and finish with a reasoned conclusion that addresses the question directly.

For source-based questions in Question Paper 2, treat each source on its own terms before comparing them. When asked to assess reliability, comment on author, purpose, audience, date and type of source, and explain how each feature affects reliability. Be specific: identify the newspaper, organisation or campaign material and explain why that provenance matters. Use evidence from the source in your explanation. When asked for an overall judgement, compare the strengths and weaknesses of the three sources and reach a supported conclusion, using comparative language such as “more reliable than” or “largely accurate” rather than vague phrases.

For the assignment, follow SQA rules for the research sheet: include clearly attributed sources, avoid pre-prepared arguments, and use the two sides of A4 to record evidence that you will quote and evaluate in the write-up. During the production stage write a structured report that uses your research sheet as evidence, includes relevant knowledge throughout, evaluates the reliability and usefulness of your sources, and reaches a clear, justified decision while acknowledging alternatives. Remember that marks are awarded for the use you make of research plus your background knowledge, analysis and evaluation; copying material or presenting a pre-prepared essay will not gain analysis marks.

Time management is crucial. For paper one allow roughly equal time for each extended question and keep a few minutes for a final read-through. In paper two practise working quickly with sources and writing concise, evidence-based comments under time pressure. Above all, answer the question set, use specific and up-to-date examples, explain why evidence matters, and finish responses with clear, evaluative conclusions that demonstrate judgement.
