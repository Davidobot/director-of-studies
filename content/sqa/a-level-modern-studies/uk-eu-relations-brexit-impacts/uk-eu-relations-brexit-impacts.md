# UK–EU relations and Brexit impacts (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## The UK and the European Union: a short background
Before the 2016 referendum the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union was complex and long-standing. The UK joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973 and over decades membership developed into the EU, combining economic integration with some political and legal cooperation. Membership meant participation in the single market and, for most EU members, the customs union, as well as adherence to shared rules shaped by EU institutions and the European Court of Justice. Over time the UK negotiated a number of opt-outs and special arrangements, reflecting debate at home about sovereignty, regulation, and the costs and benefits of EU membership. These tensions — between the desire for economic access, and concern about loss of national control — set the scene for the referendum and the choices that followed.

## The referendum, Article 50 and the withdrawal process
On 23 June 2016 the UK voted in a referendum to leave the EU. The national result was close: just under 52% voted Leave and about 48% voted Remain, with turnout high. The regional split mattered politically: Scotland voted decisively to Remain (around 62% Remain), while England and Wales produced a larger Leave vote. The referendum did not itself set out the terms of leaving, so the government triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union in March 2017 to begin a negotiated withdrawal. Negotiations covered citizens’ rights, the financial settlement, and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. A Withdrawal Agreement was eventually agreed and implemented alongside a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020. The process highlighted important questions about democratic mandate, parliamentary sovereignty, and the scope of executive power in a constitutional system where responsibility for devolved matters intersects with reserved UK competences.

## The Trade and Cooperation Agreement and legal consequences
At the end of 2020 the UK and the EU concluded the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which set the terms of the new relationship. The TCA enabled tariff-free trade in goods that meet rules of origin, but it did not restore frictionless trade. Non-tariff barriers — customs checks, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, and regulatory compliance — were reintroduced between Great Britain and the EU. For services, and particularly financial services, the agreement relied on new forms of regulatory cooperation rather than the passporting rights enjoyed under EU membership. Legally, many EU rules ceased to apply in the UK, and the direct role of the European Court of Justice was largely removed, except for residual roles under the Withdrawal Agreement and in certain Northern Ireland arrangements. For devolution, powers repatriated from the EU to the UK raised questions about who should exercise them: Westminster, the devolved administrations, or some shared framework, which has had consequences for intergovernmental relations and the politics of Scotland and Northern Ireland.

## Economic impacts: trade, investment and labour markets
Brexit’s economic effects are a mixture of immediate disruption and longer-term structural change. Leaving the single market and customs union increased trade frictions and paperwork, which has particularly affected sectors that rely on rapid cross-border flows such as fresh food, just-in-time manufacturing and parts supply chains. The TCA’s zero-tariff commitments reduced the risk of new tariffs, but the new non-tariff barriers increased costs for exporters and importers. Services, especially financial services, lost automatic access to EU markets, and while the City of London remains an international centre, some activities and personnel have shifted to EU financial centres. Foreign direct investment decisions and corporate strategies have been influenced by changing access to EU markets and regulatory divergence.

Labour market impacts include the end of free movement and the introduction of a points-based immigration system in January 2021. This change reduced the flow of EU nationals into some lower-paid sectors such as hospitality, agriculture and social care, contributing to localised labour shortages and pressures on businesses. At the same time, overall net migration rose post-Brexit because of increases in non-EU immigration for work and study; the pattern shifted rather than simply dropped. Government forecasts and independent studies suggested that, all other things being equal, leaving the EU would lower long-term GDP relative to continued membership, though estimates vary and are sensitive to assumptions about trade, regulation and post‑Brexit policy decisions.

## Social and constitutional impacts: Scotland, Northern Ireland and the union
Brexit has had significant political consequences within the UK. In Scotland the Remain vote intensified debates about constitutional future. The contrast between Scottish preferences in the referendum and UK-wide outcomes strengthened calls for another independence referendum, and the issue remains central to Scottish politics. Brexit also raised questions about the Sewel Convention and the balance of powers between Westminster and Holyrood because many formerly EU-governed areas intersect with devolved competence.

Northern Ireland experienced a particularly sensitive set of consequences because of the island’s shared land border with an EU member state. To avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland — which could have risked undermining the Good Friday Agreement — the Withdrawal Agreement established the Northern Ireland Protocol, keeping Northern Ireland aligned with certain EU rules and placing some checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That arrangement provoked political tensions, practical complications for businesses and unionist concern about the integrity of the UK internal market. Subsequent political negotiation, including the Windsor Framework agreed in 2023, aimed to address some of these practical and political difficulties by simplifying checks and creating new governance mechanisms, but the status of Northern Ireland remains a live and fragile topic. More broadly, Brexit has reshaped political debates about identity, sovereignty and the purpose of the union, and it has given new urgency to questions about democratic representation and pathways for citizens to influence government.

## Ongoing issues and policy choices after Brexit
The end of the formal membership era did not end UK–EU interaction. A list of ongoing issues includes regulatory divergence and attempts to manage it, data flows and privacy adequacy decisions, security and policing cooperation, fisheries access and quotas, and the practicalities of customs and standards. The UK has sought to build trade relationships worldwide through new agreements, while the EU has focused on preserving the integrity of its single market. Cooperation continues in many areas: security, research and education arrangements have been renegotiated or replaced; the UK moved from Erasmus to a domestic Turing Scheme for student mobility and secured participation in some EU research programmes, though access is different to membership. Data adequacy from the EU allows personal data to flow to the UK subject to formal decisions, and frameworks for police and judicial cooperation have been adapted to the post‑Brexit landscape.

For governments and civic actors the core policy choices are about how far to align with EU rules to retain market access and ease friction, or to diverge in order to pursue a distinct regulatory path; how to manage the economic transition for sectors and regions; and how to protect rights and agreements, most notably agreements underpinning peace in Northern Ireland. Each choice carries trade-offs between sovereignty, market access, administrative burden and political relationships.

## Teaching and classroom examples useful for revision
To make this topic tangible for learners, case studies and current examples are invaluable. The 2016 referendum result and regional differences make a strong case study for voting behaviour: examine why age, class, region and identity led to different patterns in Scotland, England and Wales. The operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol (and later adjustments) offers a complex, multi‑disciplinary study that links international agreements, human rights and local economic impacts. Sectors such as fisheries, agriculture and financial services provide concrete examples of how trade rules and regulatory change affect jobs, firms and local communities. Use statistics on exporting firms, examples of customs paperwork, or business testimony to support analysis, but encourage students to test the reliability of sources and to consider bias and currency. Comparing alternative models of EU relationship — membership, European Economic Area, customs union, or the TCA outcome — helps students weigh the trade-offs between sovereignty and market access.

When planning an assignment or revision essay, encourage students to combine factual knowledge (timelines, agreements, figures) with analysis of consequences and evaluation of policies, and to consider counter-arguments. Drawing links between the course’s democracy section (how citizens influenced Brexit), social issues (labour markets and migration), and international issues (the UK’s global role and EU relations) helps students show breadth and depth.

## Exam technique
In answering SQA-style questions on UK–EU relations and Brexit, always read the question carefully and tailor your response to the command words. For extended-response questions provide a clear introduction that frames the issue, develop balanced paragraphs that use specific, up-to-date examples, and end with a concise conclusion that evaluates the evidence. Avoid pre-prepared essays that ignore the exact wording of the question. In source-based questions practise detecting objectivity and assessing reliability by checking authorship, purpose, date, and potential bias; use evidence from the sources to support conclusions and make comparative judgements when asked to decide which source is most reliable. For assignments, ensure your research sheet is clearly referenced and that the production of evidence demonstrates synthesis of sources with your own knowledge. Use contemporary case studies — the 2016 referendum splits, Article 50 timeline, the TCA terms, the Northern Ireland Protocol and subsequent adjustments, shifts in migration policy and sectoral impacts — as the backbone of analysis. Remember that in SQA assessment marks are awarded for relevant knowledge, analysis and evaluation: show clear reasoning, balance evidence, and reach a justified judgment.
