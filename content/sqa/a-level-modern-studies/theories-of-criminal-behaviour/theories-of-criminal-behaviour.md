# Theories of criminal behaviour (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview of the topic
Understanding criminal behaviour is central to Modern Studies’ Law and Order unit. Theories of crime try to explain why people offend, how crime is measured, how society perceives wrongdoing and the consequences for victims, offenders and communities. At Advanced Higher level you are expected not only to describe a range of explanations — biological, psychological and sociological — but to evaluate them, use contemporary examples and compare the UK (including Scotland) with other countries. You should also be comfortable with research methods used to study crime and the strengths and weaknesses of different sources of evidence. In short, this topic links theory, evidence and policy: good answers will show how theories help make sense of patterns of offending and how they inform responses such as punishment, prevention and rehabilitation.

## Defining and measuring crime
Before evaluating theories it is essential to be clear about what we mean by crime and how we measure it. Crime is a legal concept; actions that breach criminal law in one country may not be illegal elsewhere, so definitions vary across jurisdictions. Measurement is equally tricky. Official statistics recorded by the police provide a consistent time series and are widely used in policy, but they suffer from the “dark figure” of crime: many offences are never reported or recorded. Victimisation surveys, such as the Crime Survey for England and Wales, help to reveal this hidden incidence because they ask people directly about their experiences, but they rely on memory and willingness to disclose. Self-report studies can uncover offending that never reaches the attention of authorities, especially among young people, yet these too face issues of honesty and sampling. Media reports and qualitative case studies add depth and context but may exaggerate or misrepresent trends, creating moral panics. When you evaluate theories or policies, always consider what evidence is being used and how reliable and valid it is.

## Biological and physiological explanations
Biological theories argue that some individuals have physical or genetic traits that increase the likelihood of offending. Classic examples include research into genetic markers, such as variations in the MAOA gene sometimes sensationally called the “warrior gene,” which have been linked in some studies to aggressive behaviour, particularly when combined with adverse environmental factors. Physiological markers like low resting heart rate have been associated with risk-taking and antisocial behaviour in longitudinal studies. Neurological work points to brain development issues, for instance frontal lobe dysfunction, which can impair impulse control and moral reasoning. These explanations offer insights, especially when they prompt humane interventions (for example, early screening for developmental problems). However, biological accounts are limited if presented alone; they cannot explain why only some people with a given trait offend, nor do they account for the social context. Ethical issues also arise: deterministic interpretations risk stigmatizing individuals and can lead to controversial policy proposals. A balanced evaluation recognises that biological factors may confer vulnerability but usually interact with psychological and social influences.

## Psychological explanations
Psychological theories focus on individual mental processes, personality traits and learning. Psychopathy and traits such as lack of empathy, impulsivity and thrill-seeking have been linked to persistent offending; clinical assessment tools measure these traits and can inform risk management. Learning theories emphasise processes such as classical and operant conditioning or social learning. Bandura’s concept of social learning is particularly useful: people can acquire criminal behaviour by observing and imitating role models when such behaviour appears rewarded. Attachment theory highlights the long-term effects of early relationships; prolonged maternal deprivation or poor caregiving can impede emotional development and increase vulnerability to offending. Cognitive explanations draw attention to how offenders interpret situations: moral reasoning, hostile attribution bias and neutralisation techniques (ways of justifying wrongdoing) shape behaviour. Psychological accounts are strong in explaining individual variability and for designing therapeutic interventions, but they must be assessed alongside social contexts and structural inequalities to avoid over-individualising causes.

## Sociological explanations
Sociological theories emphasise how social structures, culture and institutions shape criminal behaviour. Strain theory suggests that when legitimate means to achieve socially valued goals are blocked, people may turn to illegitimate means; this helps explain property crime and some forms of youth delinquency. Subcultural theories argue that some groups develop values that clash with mainstream norms, producing distinctive forms of offending; classic studies of delinquent gangs illustrate this dynamic. Labelling theory shifts the focus to social reaction: being labelled as a “criminal” can produce a self-fulfilling prophecy, deepen marginalisation and increase recidivism. Neo-Marxist approaches see crime as connected to power and inequality: laws often reflect the interests of dominant groups, while those disadvantaged by economic structures are more likely to be criminalised. Right realism stresses practical causes such as rational choice and environmental factors, prioritising immediate responses like tougher policing. Contemporary sociological analysis tends to be pluralist: structural factors such as poverty, education, housing and community cohesion interact with cultural and situational influences. The Scottish experience provides useful contrasts: for example, the Violence Reduction Unit adopts a public-health, sociological approach to serious violence, focusing on early intervention and addressing social determinants rather than only punitive measures.

## Social and economic impacts of crime
Crime affects individuals, families and societies in multiple, often long-lasting ways. Victims can suffer physical injury, financial loss, psychological trauma and social stigma; repeated victimisation can erode trust in public institutions and reduce community cohesion. Offenders experience loss of liberty, damage to future employment prospects, and sometimes deepening cycles of disadvantage that affect their families, especially children. At a community level, high crime rates can depress local businesses, reduce property values and create “postcode poverty,” where services withdraw and reputations harden. At national level, the costs are substantial: policing, courts, prisons, victim services and the economic consequences of crime add up. These impacts shape debates on priorities: should limited resources be focused on prevention and social investment, or on law enforcement and punishment? Comparative examples matter here. Some countries prioritise rehabilitation and community sanctions, aiming to reduce reoffending and long-term social costs, while others emphasise incarceration and deterrence with different short-term impacts on public safety and long-term effects on recidivism.

## Responses to crime: punishment, prevention and reform
Responses to crime are informed by competing theories of punishment and by practical considerations of effectiveness, rights and resources. Theories of punishment include deterrence, which aims to discourage offending through the threat of sanction; rehabilitation, which seeks to change behaviour by addressing underlying needs; incapacitation, which removes dangerous individuals from society; retributivism, which emphasises proportionality and moral desert; and denunciation, which expresses societal condemnation. In practice, many systems combine elements of these approaches. Scotland provides a contemporary case study of mixed responses: Community Payback Orders and restorative justice approaches aim to repair harm and reduce reoffending, while prisons continue to be used for serious and persistent offenders. Preventative strategies vary from community policing, hot-spot policing and target hardening to early intervention programmes that address childhood risk factors. Multi-agency initiatives, such as partnerships between police, health services and social work, have become prominent in tackling complex problems like serious violence and substance misuse. Evaluating responses requires evidence: which interventions reduce reoffending or harm, for whom and at what cost? Policies that look effective in one context may not transfer easily to another due to cultural and structural differences, so comparative analysis and rigorous evaluation are vital.

## Research methods and ethical issues in studying crime
Researching criminal behaviour uses a wide range of methods, each with strengths and limits. Official statistics are useful for trend analysis but can misrepresent prevalence. Surveys and questionnaires can gather victim and offender perspectives at scale, but sampling and response bias must be managed. Interviews and focus groups yield rich qualitative insights into motives and context, while observation studies — whether covert or overt — can reveal behaviours that participants might not report. Longitudinal studies are especially valuable for explaining how life-course factors relate to offending, but they are costly and time-consuming. Case studies provide depth and are often used in policy evaluation. Ethical issues are prominent in crime research: studying vulnerable victims, interviewing offenders, or using covert methods raises concerns about consent, harm and confidentiality. Researchers must balance the need for valid data with respect for participants’ rights and safety. In exam answers, be ready to compare methods, comment on their suitability for particular research questions, and discuss how ethical constraints shape what researchers can discover.

## Exam technique
In exam answers aim for clarity, balance and evidence. Always define key terms early and show you understand the measurement issues behind crime statistics. For 30-mark essays, plan a clear line of argument and use contemporary, relevant examples from the UK or Scotland plus at least one other country to meet the comparative requirement. Avoid relying on pre-prepared essays; tailor your response to the exact question and use evaluation throughout, not just in a final paragraph. When discussing theories, explain the core idea, give concrete examples and then evaluate strengths and weaknesses, including empirical support and limitations. In methods questions demonstrate knowledge of a range of approaches and assess their suitability and ethical implications for the scenario given. For source-based questions focus on provenance, methodology, potential bias and the extent to which the source is trustworthy, drawing on external knowledge to corroborate or challenge it. In coursework or the project–dissertation choose a contemporary, researchable question, justify your methods, use varied sources, evaluate ethical issues and ensure your conclusion makes a balanced, evidence-based judgement. Finally, organise your writing clearly, signpost arguments, reach a developed conclusion and, where possible, comment on the implications for policy.
