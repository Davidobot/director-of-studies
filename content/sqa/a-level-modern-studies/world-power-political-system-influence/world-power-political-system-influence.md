# Studying a world power: political systems and international influence (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Course overview and aims
This course develops a disciplined understanding of contemporary political, social and international issues and the skills needed to investigate them. It combines factual knowledge with the ability to analyse evidence, evaluate competing explanations and make justified decisions. The course emphasises the democratic process and political institutions in Scotland and the wider UK, explores either social inequality or crime and the law as a major social issue, and offers focused study of an international topic: either a major world power or a global issue that crosses national borders. Throughout, the aim is to build research, literacy, numeracy and higher-order thinking skills so you can interpret complex source material, weigh competing viewpoints and produce clear, supported judgements.

Teachers will encourage you to approach topics from different disciplinary angles — politics, sociology, economics and international relations — and to apply classroom learning to real-world examples. You will be expected to use up-to-date case studies and to show how evidence from sources, statistics and policy documents supports (or undermines) particular arguments. These skills not only prepare you for external assessment but also for informed citizenship beyond the classroom.

## Democracy in Scotland and the United Kingdom
A core theme is how political power is organised and contested within the UK and how Scotland fits into that picture. You should be comfortable explaining the devolved settlement and the roles of the UK and Scottish Parliaments, and be able to discuss alternatives such as further devolution, federalism, or independence. Knowledge of how laws are made, the checks and scrutiny functions of parliaments and committees, and the interaction between executive and legislature is essential.

Electoral systems are a frequent exam focus: know the mechanics, strengths and weaknesses of first-past-the-post, additional member systems and single transferable vote, and be ready to evaluate them in terms of representation, fairness and political stability. Voting behaviour is another key area; you will need to discuss long-term factors like class and region alongside short-term influences such as leadership image and media campaigns, and explain recent trends such as the growing effect of age and social media on turnout and party support.

Be prepared to evaluate the ways citizens can influence government, from voting to pressure group activity, petitions, and digital campaigning. In analysis, use contemporary examples — for instance recent general elections, devolved elections, or referendums — to illustrate how institutions, media and interest groups shape decision-making and accountability.

## Social issues in the United Kingdom
The course asks you to investigate a major social issue in depth, choosing either social inequality or crime and the law. For social inequality, you should be able to explain causes of income and wealth disparity, health inequalities and their consequences for different groups. Consider structural factors such as labour market trends and housing, as well as policy drivers like taxation, welfare provision and public services. Be ready to evaluate collectivist and individualist approaches to social policy: how far should the state intervene, what has the welfare state achieved, and where have government measures succeeded or fallen short? Use concrete examples such as the minimum wage, NHS provisions, free prescriptions in Scotland, or changes to benefits policy to illustrate your points.

If you take crime and the law, focus on theories of crime (biological, psychological, sociological), legal rights and responsibilities, and the social and economic impacts of crime on victims, offenders and communities. You should assess custodial and non-custodial responses, comparing outcomes such as reoffending rates, community safety and cost. Contemporary case material — for instance debates over sentencing, community alternatives like electronic monitoring, or high-profile reform proposals — will strengthen answers by showing how theory and policy interact in practice.

Whichever social context you choose, be ready to draw on statistical evidence, case studies and government initiatives, and to judge the effectiveness of measures aimed at reducing inequality or crime.

## Studying a world power: political and socio-economic analysis
When you study a major world power you analyse both its domestic political system and its international influence. Candidates may choose any G20 member (excluding the UK) or the EU. You must be able to assess democratic participation — how free and fair elections are, whether civil liberties allow effective political contestation, and how institutions channel popular will. Compare systems where elections and pluralism are robust with those where party dominance, restricted media or strong executive control limit participation, using countries such as the United States and China to draw contrasts about checks and balances, party systems and civil liberties.

Socio-economic inequality is central in such case studies. Explain the distribution of income and opportunities, the impact on specific groups (by ethnicity, gender or region), and how government policy addresses these problems through taxation, welfare, education and targeted programmes. Evaluate the effectiveness of those policies using measurable outcomes such as poverty rates, educational attainment gaps or health indicators.

International influence is another major focus. Consider hard power elements like military capability and economic size, and soft power tools such as diplomacy, development assistance, cultural reach and participation in international organisations. The global role of a world power can be illustrated by trade relationships, leadership within multilateral institutions, peacekeeping or military interventions, and foreign direct investment. Use modern examples — economic leverage in trade negotiations, diplomatic responses to crises, or participation in climate diplomacy — to show how domestic capacity translates into global influence.

## Contemporary world issues and international responses
The alternative international option asks you to study a transnational issue such as climate change, large-scale migration, global pandemics, or regional conflicts that have wider repercussions. For any chosen issue, you must analyse the social, economic and political causes, its effects on individuals and communities, and the pressures it creates for national governments and the international community. Examination answers should explain how instability or humanitarian need can affect neighbouring states, global markets and international institutions.

Assessing responses requires critical appraisal of national policy and multilateral action. Consider the strengths and limits of tools available: military intervention, sanctions, humanitarian aid, development programmes, peacekeeping operations and international law. Evaluate organisations such as the United Nations, regional alliances and specialist agencies in terms of mandate, resources and political cohesion. Use recent or ongoing examples to demonstrate how effective these responses are, and what structural obstacles — divided Security Council politics, limited funding, or conflicting national interests — hinder resolution.

## Assessment structure and the assignment
Assessment combines extended-response exam papers and a research-based assignment. The main question paper requires three extended essays: one on democracy in Scotland and the UK, one on a chosen social issue, and one on an international topic. These responses test your ability to give detailed explanations, analyse complexity and evaluate competing arguments. A second, shorter paper concentrates on source-handling skills: drawing supported conclusions, detecting objectivity, and assessing reliability from a set of sources presented in written, numerical or pictorial form.

The assignment is an individual research task worth a significant portion of the course. You choose a contemporary modern studies issue that allows competing viewpoints and recommend a course of action or reach a reasoned decision. The assignment demands robust research, synthesis of evidence, critical evaluation of sources, and a clear, report-style presentation. Research is carried out with limited supervision, while the final write-up is produced under a high degree of control to ensure authenticity. The research sheet that you submit alongside the assignment is an important support tool: it must be no more than two sides of A4 and should list and attribute the sources you used, but it must not contain pre-written argument or a detailed plan of your report.

## Research skills and source evaluation
Strong research practice is central to success. Your research sheet should identify each source clearly with author, date, title and publication so markers can see what evidence you relied on. Include a variety of sources — official statistics, reputable newspapers, academic articles, reports from international organisations and statements from relevant agencies. Avoid dumping long URLs or copying extensive passages; instead extract key facts, figures or quotations with brief notes that you will later analyse and synthesize.

When evaluating sources, focus on provenance, purpose, timeliness, and potential bias. A government health agency, a professional association, and an academic commentary may all have useful information but different perspectives and reliability. Consider why a source was produced, who benefits from its message and whether data are current and verifiable. In source-based exam questions, you will be required to judge objectivity as well as reliability: explain what each source emphasises or omits, and use cross-checking between sources to show where evidence converges or conflicts. A strong answer compares sources and reaches an overall judgement about which is most trustworthy, using specific evidence rather than vague generalities.

Beyond evaluation, make sure you practise numeracy and graphical interpretation. Many source tasks include charts, tables or poll results; you must be able to describe trends, identify anomalies and use numbers to reinforce qualitative analysis.

## Exam technique
Time management and careful reading of the question are as important as subject knowledge. For extended-response questions, plan briefly at the start to ensure your answer fits the specific command word: explain, assess, evaluate and compare each require different balances of description, analysis and judgement. Aim to embed up-to-date, relevant examples and use them to back analytical points rather than as general background. Demonstrate knowledge in short, well-integrated paragraphs and follow this with analysis that links evidence to the question. End extended answers with an evaluative conclusion that directly addresses the question rather than merely summarising points.

In the source paper, treat the given materials as the primary evidence. For conclusions-based questions use the sources to support each bullet point and then provide an overall judgement that synthesises this evidence; the conclusion must be grounded in the sources and not be a new piece of background knowledge. When asked to judge accuracy, give a quantitative-style judgement (for example, “largely accurate”) and justify it with the clearest supporting points. For reliability tasks assess each source individually against criteria such as authorship, purpose, date and corroboration, and finish with a comparative judgement explaining which source you consider most reliable and why.

For the assignment, choose an issue that genuinely allows competing options so your decision can be evaluated. Use the research stage to build a well-balanced sheet, labelling sources clearly and noting strengths and weaknesses. During the production stage work independently, follow a clear report structure with an introduction, evidence-based analysis, evaluation of sources, consideration of alternatives and a justified recommendation. Keep the research sheet concise and useful: include key facts, relevant quotations with full attribution, and the statistical or documentary references you will cite. Remember that markers award marks for your use of research and your ability to integrate knowledge with sourced evidence, not for pre-prepared essays.

Practice past-style questions and timed source exercises, ask for feedback on structure and use of evidence, and review examiner commentaries where possible. Consistent practice in applying knowledge to specific question demands, together with disciplined source evaluation, will move answers from description to higher-level analysis and evaluation — the skills that secure top marks.
