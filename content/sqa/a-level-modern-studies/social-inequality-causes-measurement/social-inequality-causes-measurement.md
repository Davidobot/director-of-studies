# Social inequality: causes and measurement (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview of the topic
Social inequality examines how resources, opportunities and outcomes are distributed across society, why these differences exist, and what consequences they produce for individuals, communities and nations. At Advanced Higher level this topic is studied through a multidisciplinary lens, drawing on political science, sociology, economics and international comparison. Candidates are expected to understand both the big-picture causes of inequality and the detailed ways it can be measured and researched, and to apply this knowledge to contemporary Scottish, UK and international contexts. The course encourages independent enquiry: students are asked to synthesise theory, empirical evidence and research methods to form balanced judgements on complex questions such as why poverty persists in affluent countries, or how effective particular policy responses are in reducing inequality.

## Defining and measuring social inequality
Social inequality can be defined in many ways, but at its core it refers to systematic differences in material wealth, access to services, life chances and social status. Measurement is a crucial part of understanding inequality, and different indicators capture different aspects. Income measures, such as median household income, are widely used to capture the flow of money into households, while wealth measures consider accumulated assets and are often more unequal than income. The Gini coefficient provides a single-number summary of income or wealth inequality, with values closer to one indicating greater inequality. Poverty can be defined in relative terms, for example households earning below a proportion of median income, or in absolute terms, using a fixed basket of needs. Social mobility is measured by comparing a person’s socio-economic position with that of their parents, using occupational class, educational attainment or earnings as proxies. Measurement challenges are common: underreporting of income, hidden wealth, regional cost-of-living differences, and changing household composition all complicate comparisons over time and between countries. Perceptions of inequality are also important and are captured by attitudinal surveys; public perception can diverge markedly from statistical trends and itself shape political responses.

## Theories explaining inequality
Theories of social inequality help explain why differences persist and who or what is responsible. Individualist explanations stress personal responsibility, talent and choice, and suggest that inequalities are the result of differences in effort, ability or preferences. Functionalist approaches argue that some inequalities serve a societal purpose by providing incentives and allocating roles; from this perspective a degree of inequality is necessary for efficiency. Structuralist and conflict theories, drawing on Marxist traditions, emphasise the role of economic structures, property relations and power: inequalities are produced and reproduced by institutions such as labour markets, education systems and states, and benefit dominant groups. Each theoretical lens offers different policy implications: individualist accounts favour targeted measures to improve incentives and personal capacity, functionalist accounts tolerate certain inequalities as functional, while structuralist analyses point to redistributive policies and institutional reform. In practice, contemporary debate often mixes these perspectives, and the strongest explanations for specific outcomes usually combine individual-level factors with structural constraints.

## Social stratification and mobility
Social stratification describes the layered structure of society, often conceptualised in terms of class, occupation, education and status. Class remains a useful analytical tool, though its meaning has evolved; today it is often linked with patterns of education, income and cultural capital. Meritocracy as an ideal suggests that social position should reflect talent and effort rather than birth, yet empirical studies of social mobility show persistent advantages transmitted across generations. The tension between agency and structure is central: individuals make choices, but those choices are constrained by family resources, neighbourhoods, schooling and social networks. Mobility can be intergenerational or intragenerational, and it can differ across societies: some countries show relatively high levels of equality of opportunity and strong welfare-state mechanisms that buffer disadvantage, while others have more rigid class structures. Understanding stratification requires attention to both objective measures—such as educational outcomes and occupational status—and subjective experiences, including stigma and community reputation, which shape life chances in subtle but powerful ways.

## Impacts of social inequality
Inequality has consequences at multiple levels. At the individual level, lower socio-economic position is associated with poorer educational attainment, limited employment prospects, worse physical and mental health, and constrained lifestyle choices. Early childhood experiences, including exposure to stress and adverse conditions, can have lifelong effects. At the community level, concentrated disadvantage can weaken social cohesion, reduce local services and investment, and damage the reputation of places, which in turn affects local businesses and employment. Postcode differences in opportunity are a familiar feature of many cities. Nationally, high levels of inequality can strain public services: unequal access to healthcare, housing and education increases demand and redistributive pressures. Economically, inequality can reduce aggregate demand if large groups have low purchasing power, and politically it can undermine trust in institutions and fuel polarisation. Internationally, differences between countries in inequality influence migration patterns, development outcomes and global stability. It is important to note that impacts are not experienced uniformly; gender, ethnicity, age and disability intersect with class and income to produce complex patterns of disadvantage.

## Responses to social inequality
Responses to social inequality range from individual-level interventions to large-scale state policies, and from voluntary sector activity to market-based solutions. Theoretical approaches to response often fall along a spectrum from individualism to collectivism. Individualist responses emphasise education, skills, incentives and personal responsibility. Collectivist or redistributionist responses prioritise progressive taxation, strong welfare provision, universal public services and regulatory measures to reduce market inequalities. Practical policy tools include social security systems, targeted benefits, minimum wage and living wage policies, progressive taxation, publicly funded education and health services, affordable housing programmes and active labour market measures. Non-governmental organisations and social enterprises also play roles, offering services, advocacy and community development. Comparative examples are instructive: some Northern European countries combine strong universal services with high taxation and show comparatively low poverty and high intergenerational mobility, while other systems give greater scope to markets and show higher levels of inequality. Evaluating responses requires attention to design, political feasibility, cost, unintended consequences, and the degree to which interventions reach the most disadvantaged.

## Research methods and evaluating sources
Robust research underpins sound analysis of inequality, and Advanced Higher candidates must be familiar with a range of social science methods. Official statistics provide valuable national and regional indicators but must be interpreted with care, considering definitions, collection methods and time lags. Surveys, whether postal, telephone or online, can capture attitudes and self-reported behaviours but are vulnerable to sampling bias and question framing. Interviews—structured, semi-structured or unstructured—offer depth and nuance, making them useful for exploring lived experience, while focus groups can reveal group dynamics and consensus or disagreement within communities. Observation methods, both participant and non-participant, provide insights into everyday practices but raise ethical and practical issues. Case studies and longitudinal research allow examination of change over time and pathways into and out of poverty. Source evaluation is a key skill: students must assess provenance, methodology, representativeness, potential bias and the limits of generalisation. Ethical considerations—consent, confidentiality and avoidance of harm—are especially important when researching vulnerable populations. Comparative research requires careful matching of indicators and context; simply comparing headline statistics between countries can be misleading without attention to institutional and cultural differences.

## Project–dissertation guidance
The project–dissertation offers an opportunity to conduct sustained independent research on a contemporary inequality issue. Choosing a topic that is both academically appropriate and practically researchable is crucial. Strong dissertations frame a clear research question using stems such as "To what extent…" or "To what extent has X influenced Y?", rather than vague aims like "to find out…". Candidates should justify their topic, explain its significance, and identify the scope and limitations of their enquiry. Methodological rigor matters: a well-argued selection of methods, with discussion of benefits, limitations and ethical issues, will strengthen the work. Primary research is not mandatory but can enrich findings; if primary data are used, candidates should ensure appropriate consent and careful handling of personal data. Secondary sources should be wide-ranging and academic where possible, and appendices should document the research process—survey instruments, interview transcripts or datasets—and be integrated into the main analysis. Attention to referencing and a consistent house style is expected, and the dissertation must respect the 5,000-word limit for the main text, including the evaluation of methods. Candidates should plan time for drafting, feedback and proofreading, and be prepared to justify methodological choices and interpret findings in relation to theory and comparative evidence.

## Exam technique
Exam answers should be planned and structured to address the precise demands of the question. For 30-mark extended-response essays, begin with a focused introduction that defines key terms and outlines the line of argument, making clear any comparative approach to be used. Develop paragraphs that integrate theory, empirical evidence and comparative examples; aim for synthesis by linking points rather than listing disconnected facts. Use up-to-date, relevant examples and where possible acknowledge their origin; comparisons between the UK or Scotland and one or more other countries strengthen answers. For research methods questions, demonstrate knowledge of multiple approaches, compare their suitability for the scenario presented, and discuss practical and ethical issues. Source-based questions require evaluation of provenance, methodology, accuracy, potential bias and relevance to the research question; combine evidence from the source with broader methodological knowledge. Time management is important: allocate time to planning, writing and re-reading answers. In the project–dissertation, follow required conventions for presentation and word count, provide a clear evaluative conclusion rather than mere summary, and ensure all appendices are clearly referenced and used in the main text. Finally, practise applying theory to contemporary examples under timed conditions, and seek feedback on essay structure, use of evidence and depth of analysis so that responses are consistently focused, comparative and evaluative.
