# Source evaluation and research skills for Modern Studies (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Why source evaluation and research matter in Modern Studies
Source evaluation and research skills lie at the heart of Higher Modern Studies because the subject is fundamentally about interpreting political, social and international evidence and making reasoned judgements. You will be asked not only to recall facts but to weigh competing accounts, to assess the trustworthiness of different kinds of evidence, and to reach supported conclusions. Developing these skills helps with classwork and with the three course assessment components: the extended-response question paper that tests knowledge, the source-based question paper that tests analysis and evaluation of given material, and the assignment where you must research, synthesise and evaluate a contemporary issue and produce a decision under controlled conditions. Good source work increases the quality of your argument, supports precise conclusions and protects you from being misled by persuasive but unreliable material.

## Knowing the kinds of sources and their provenance
Sources in Modern Studies take many forms: newspaper and website articles, government statistics and reports, pressure-group material, party campaign posters, infographics, academic commentaries, and charts or graphs. Each type has characteristic strengths and weaknesses. A government health infographic may contain carefully gathered statistics but it will also have a purpose — to inform or to reassure — that shapes how data are presented. A political party poster will present a clear message but be openly partial by design. Academic writing typically offers method and citation, increasing its credibility, while blog posts and social media can be highly topical but harder to authenticate. When you evaluate a source, always start by identifying its provenance: who produced it, when, for whom, and in what format. These facts give immediate clues about likely expertise, possible agendas and the resource’s intended audience. Provenance is not a binary verdict but the first step in forming a reasoned judgement about usefulness and reliability.

## How to evaluate reliability: expertise, purpose, currency and method
Reliability is judged through several interlinked factors. Expertise matters: sources produced by recognised experts, professional bodies, or statistical offices usually score well because they follow established methods and are accountable to readers. Purpose and audience must be considered: producers may emphasise or omit evidence to persuade, recruit or defend a position, and the message is therefore shaped by intent. Currency is critical for fast-moving topics such as public opinion or an ongoing international crisis; an otherwise sound source that is several years old may be less useful for assessing current conditions. Method or transparency is also central: a source that explains how data were collected, the sample size for a poll, or the criteria used in research is easier to verify and so more reliable. In practice you must combine these elements: weigh expertise against potential bias, judge whether the method supports the claims made, and consider whether the date weakens the source’s value for the question at hand.

## Detecting objectivity and assessing accuracy
Questions about objectivity ask you to detect and explain how far sources present balanced or partial accounts. Objectivity is rarely absolute. Rather than using vague phrases such as “to a certain extent,” it is more effective to point to concrete features that show partiality or balance. For example, a newspaper leader that uses emotive language and provides only one side of an argument shows clear bias; an official statistical release that provides raw tables and acknowledges limitations appears more objective. Accuracy relates to how closely a source’s claims match the best available evidence. Numerical claims should be checked for consistency with other data, and graphical representations need scrutiny for misleading scales or truncated axes. When making an overall judgement about accuracy, use terms that convey degree — such as “largely accurate” or “partly inaccurate” — supported by precise evidence drawn from the sources. Absolute claims like “completely accurate” usually lose marks in examination questions because they ignore uncertainty and counter-evidence.

## Using sources to draw and support conclusions
Drawing conclusions from sources means synthesising the information and explaining how it leads to a clear judgement. In source-based questions you must base your points on the material provided, showing how specific evidence supports a line of argument. Effective answers refer to particular details: a statistic, a quotation or a feature of an image, and explain its significance. Good conclusions are not simple summaries of earlier points; they are evaluative judgements that weigh strengths and weaknesses and explain which source or combination of sources is most persuasive and why. When asked to decide which source is most reliable, compare the sources directly on the same criteria and justify the decision using evidence from each source. Avoid bringing in extra background knowledge in questions that explicitly require you to use the sources only; doing so can earn no marks and can be penalising in tightly judged source tasks.

## Research skills and preparing the research sheet
The assignment and wider course work demand systematic research skills. Start by choosing a contemporary, debatable issue that allows alternative viewpoints and policy responses. Your research phase should gather a range of sources that provide different types of evidence and perspectives: statistical data, expert commentary, official reports, and relevant media. Keep meticulous provenance information for every item: author, title, publisher, date and precise web address if applicable. The Modern Studies research sheet is central to success. It must fit on no more than two sides of A4 and should contain the actual sourced information you will use in the write-up: succinct quotations, key statistics, labelled sources and brief evaluative notes. The sheet should not contain pre-prepared arguments, headings for the final report, or extended drafts; including those will reduce the marks you can earn for knowledge and independent analysis. A well-structured research sheet labels sources clearly, highlights the most useful pieces of evidence, and records short comments about reliability and relevance so that you can reference them quickly during the timed production stage.

## The assignment and rules for controlled production
The assignment has two distinct stages. During the research stage, which is conducted under some supervision, you may use any resources and you should show evidence of independent research. Teachers will monitor progress and may provide generic guidance, but they must not supply specific sources, detailed plans or model answers. The production of evidence stage is strictly controlled: you have 90 minutes to write the assignment and you are allowed only the two-sided research sheet as a resource. Work must be your own and you must be in direct sight of an assessor during the write-up. The report-style assignment should identify the issue, present competing views and evidence, evaluate sources and reach a clear, justified decision or recommendation while acknowledging plausible alternatives. Marks are awarded for knowledge, for analysis and synthesis of sourced material, for evaluation of sources, and for the reasoned decision you reach. Remember that the marker will look for explicit reference to the research sheet, and that any unattributed information in the write-up will be marked as knowledge rather than use of sources, which affects the marks available for analysis.

## Exam technique
Approaching the source paper and the extended-response paper requires disciplined technique. For source questions allocate time so that you read all sources carefully before writing, annotating them for provenance, purpose and key details. In “drawing conclusions” questions, integrate evidence from across the sources and make sure the overall conclusion is evaluative rather than a simple summary. For “degree of objectivity” questions, point to language, omissions and visual features that indicate bias or balance, and always support your judgements with source material. For “reliability” questions, give an individual assessment of each source and finish with a comparative overall judgement that directly explains why one source is the most reliable. Avoid using vague phrases; be specific about how the evidence supports your view and, where relevant, use quantitative language such as “largely accurate” or “partly unreliable.” Time management matters: in the source paper practise producing concise, evidence-led answers under timed conditions so you can develop clear linkages between source material and argument. In the extended essays use up-to-date and varied examples that are adapted to the question asked rather than relying on pre-prepared answers. For the assignment, plan your research so your sheet contains a balanced spread of evidence and evaluative notes; during the production stage use the sheet as an evidence bank to support precise analysis and to demonstrate the controlled independence of your work. Above all, practise the skill of moving from evidence to explanation and then to a reasoned judgement: this sequence is what examiners reward in both source evaluation and research assessment.
