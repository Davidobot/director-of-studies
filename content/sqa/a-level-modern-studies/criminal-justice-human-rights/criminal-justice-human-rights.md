# Criminal justice and human rights (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview
Criminal justice and human rights is a core strand of Advanced Higher Modern Studies that asks you to understand how legal systems operate, how societies measure and respond to crime, and how human rights shape and constrain those responses. The topic asks you to combine knowledge of institutions and law with theories of criminal behaviour and the practical challenges of punishment, prevention and rehabilitation. At this level you are expected not only to describe systems and policies, but to analyse, evaluate and synthesise evidence, to adopt comparative perspectives and to conduct independent research. The course is assessed through a three-hour question paper and a substantial project–dissertation, so your revision should balance detailed factual knowledge, theory and source-based and methodological skills.

## The criminal justice system and human rights
Understanding the criminal justice system requires attention to its institutions, the rule of law and how human rights and civil liberties interact with policing, prosecution and sentencing. Consideration of judicial frameworks includes judicial independence, appointment processes, judicial review and the relationships between the judiciary, the executive and legislatures. Human rights are often embedded in constitutional arrangements and domestic legislation and they can both protect individuals and create tensions with security or public order policies. When you study human rights in the criminal justice context, think about how rights such as the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial, privacy and protections against inhuman treatment shape policing practices, evidence gathering and sentencing. Contemporary issues such as surveillance, counter-terror powers and stop-and-search practices reveal the trade-offs that democracies face between protecting citizens and protecting liberty.

## Understanding criminal behaviour
A strong Advanced Higher answer moves beyond simple definitions of crime to a considered discussion of how crime is measured, how public perceptions are shaped and the multitude of explanations for offending. Measurement issues include recorded crime statistics, victimisation surveys and self-report studies; each has strengths and emphasises different aspects of criminality. Explanatory frameworks span physiological accounts, which look at biological factors or neurological development, psychological theories that stress personality, trauma or cognitive processes, and sociological approaches that place emphasis on social structures, subcultures, labelling and opportunity. Right realist and left realist positions debate causes and solutions in different ways. To master this section you should be able to compare theories, discuss the empirical evidence for and against them and explain how public perceptions, moral panics and media narratives can distort understanding of what actually drives offending.

## Responses to crime and punishment
Responses to criminal behaviour operate at several levels: punishment philosophies, practical sentencing options, preventative strategies and rehabilitative or restorative interventions. Theories of punishment — including deterrence, rehabilitation, incapacitation, retributivism and denunciation — provide a framework for assessing why societies punish and what they hope to achieve. In practice, responses include custodial sentences, community-based orders such as Community Payback Orders, restorative justice initiatives and drug treatment or electronic monitoring programmes. Each option raises questions of effectiveness, cost, legitimacy and human rights; prisons may aim to rehabilitate but face problems of overcrowding, drugs and recidivism, while community sanctions may reduce reoffending but be perceived as too lenient. Preventative responses range from policing innovations and hotspot tactics to early-intervention social programmes and multi-agency partnerships. Evaluating the evidence for these approaches and recognising their trade-offs is central to higher-level analysis.

## Measuring crime and social science research methods
Advanced Higher Modern Studies places a premium on research methods. You must understand how different methods generate evidence and how to judge their reliability, validity and ethical implications. Official statistics are invaluable but reflect police activity and recording practices rather than a comprehensive picture of offending. Surveys and victimisation studies may capture hidden crime but face sampling and response biases. Interviews and focus groups generate depth and understanding of motives and impacts but are less generalisable. Observation, including covert techniques, raises ethical questions about consent, while longitudinal studies offer insight into patterns over time. Source evaluation requires attention to provenance, methodology, sample size, date of publication and potential bias. In the exam you will be asked to compare methods and to judge the trustworthiness of a particular source; being able to refer to concrete examples of methods you have encountered — or used in your research — will strengthen your answers.

## Impacts of crime on individuals and communities
Crime affects victims, perpetrators, families and wider society in multiple, often overlapping ways. Victims may suffer physical injury, financial loss, psychological trauma and social stigma; victims’ needs also shape policy responses such as victim support services and compensation schemes. Perpetrators face loss of liberty, social exclusion and economic consequences, and their imprisonment or punishment has knock-on effects for families, particularly children. At a community level, high crime rates can erode social cohesion, reduce local investment and alter service provision, while the national costs of crime — policing, courts, incarceration and repair — are significant. Analysing impacts requires attention to differential effects by gender, age, ethnicity and place, and to how inequality and social disadvantage both contribute to and are exacerbated by crime.

## Comparative perspectives and case studies
A comparative approach is central to Advanced Higher assessment. Comparing the UK or Scotland with other countries helps you evaluate whether policies are culturally specific or transferable. For example, Scandinavian systems often emphasise rehabilitation and have lower incarceration rates, which invites discussion of whether reduced imprisonment produces lower recidivism or whether different social safety nets drive those outcomes. The United States provides a contrasting case with high incarceration rates and debates about mandatory sentencing and mass incarceration. Scotland’s Violence Reduction Unit offers a real-world case study of a public health approach to violence that shifts focus from prosecution to prevention; Community Payback Orders and restorative justice schemes show how alternatives to custody are being developed. Use such case studies to illustrate points, to test theories and to show nuanced judgement about context and transferability.

## Project–dissertation and assessment overview
The project–dissertation gives you the opportunity to pursue independent research on a contemporary, complex issue. It is worth 36% of the overall marks and has a 5,000-word limit for the main body and method evaluation. Successful projects justify a clear research question or hypothesis (phrased as “To what extent…?” or “To what extent does X affect Y?”), use a wide range of sources, evaluate chosen methods, and synthesise evidence into a coherent, balanced conclusion. Primary research is not mandatory but can enrich the study; regardless, you must evaluate methods, discuss ethical issues and show how your sources support your argument. Teachers provide reasonable assistance during the planning stage but the dissertation must be your own work and will be externally marked. Appendices such as interview transcripts, survey data or statistical tables are important and should be referenced in the main text; they demonstrate the research process and can lend weight to your analysis if integrated properly.

## Exam technique
The question paper lasts three hours and is divided into three optional sections; you choose the section on law and order and answer Part A and Part B within it. Part A requires two extended 30-mark essays chosen from three questions, while Part B contains two 15-mark questions: one on research methods and one source-evaluation task. Time management is essential: plan each 30-mark essay carefully, aiming for a clear introduction that sets out your answer, a structured argument supported by contemporary and comparative examples, and a developed conclusion that reaches a judgement. Avoid pre-prepared essays that do not fit the specific question; instead, practise adapting knowledge to the question’s wording and ensure your conclusion addresses the stem directly. For the 15-mark research methods question, explain why particular methods are suitable or unsuitable in the scenario given, discuss reliability and validity, and consider ethical constraints and alternatives. In the source question, assess provenance, methodology, sample and context and combine evidence from the source with your wider knowledge about methodology and the topic. Use Scottish examples alongside at least one international comparison to secure higher marks. When preparing your project, frame clear research aims, keep a record of progress, reference consistently and evaluate methods critically rather than merely describing them. Finally, practise past papers under timed conditions, read widely to develop up-to-date examples and always aim to synthesise theory and evidence into a reasoned, balanced judgement.
