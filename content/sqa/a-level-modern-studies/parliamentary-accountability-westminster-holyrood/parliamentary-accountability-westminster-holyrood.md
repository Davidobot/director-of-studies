# Parliamentary accountability (Westminster & Holyrood) (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What parliamentary accountability means and why it matters
Parliamentary accountability describes the ways in which elected representatives and governments are made answerable to parliament and, through parliament, to the public. At its core it is about transparency, scrutiny and control: ensuring that decisions taken in government can be examined, challenged and, where necessary, corrected. For students of Modern Studies, understanding accountability is central because it links democratic theory — representation, mandate and legitimacy — to the everyday practices that keep power in check. In the United Kingdom this scrutiny takes place across multiple institutions. Westminster, as the UK Parliament, holds the UK Government to account; Holyrood, the Scottish Parliament, holds the Scottish Government to account. Although many mechanisms look similar on paper — questions, debates, committees — the balance of powers, political culture and the practical operation of these tools differ in important ways and shape how effective accountability is in practice.

## Formal tools of scrutiny: questions, votes and ministerial responsibility
Parliaments have a range of formal mechanisms to question and challenge ministers. Oral question times — Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) at Westminster and First Minister’s Questions (FMQs) at Holyrood — are the most visible. They are short, highly publicised opportunities for direct questioning and for the opposition to highlight government failings. Written questions supplement oral sessions, giving backbenchers a route to demand documented answers on specific points.

Beyond questioning, parliaments control the purse. Votes on government budgets and individual Bills are powerful moments when the legislature can accept or reject government proposals. The ultimate constitutional weapon is a vote of no confidence, which, at Westminster, can force a government to resign or trigger a general election. Ministerial responsibility provides a code of behaviour: individual ministers are expected to take responsibility for mistakes in their departments, and collective responsibility binds ministers to support government policy in public. In reality, resignation remains rare and is subject to political calculation.

Devolution adds another layer. The Scottish Parliament has legislative competence in devolved areas and uses legislative stages, committee scrutiny and votes to hold the Scottish Government to account. At the same time the devolution settlement includes conventions and mechanisms — such as legislative consent motions — that require cooperation between parliaments when UK-wide matters affect devolved competence. These formal arrangements create both checks and potential friction between Westminster and Holyrood.

## Committees and evidence-based scrutiny
Committees are the working engines of parliamentary scrutiny. Select committees at Westminster and subject committees at Holyrood examine policy, administration and expenditure. They call witnesses, take written and oral evidence, commission research and publish reports that can expose failures, recommend reforms and keep issues on the political agenda. The Public Accounts Committee and departmental select committees at Westminster play a particular role in financial oversight, while Holyrood committees routinely scrutinise draft legislation and the performance of public bodies and ministers.

Committees’ strength comes from their sustained examination of a topic, cross-party membership and continuity beyond the electoral cycle. They provide space for detailed, evidence-based criticism that is harder to achieve in the heat of daily parliamentary debate. Their reports may not bind governments, but they carry moral and political force: a well-argued committee report can attract media attention, influence public opinion and prompt ministerial change. The House of Lords, although unelected, undertakes significant revising and scrutiny work on legislation, using expertise to shape amendments and force further debate. In Scotland, the lack of an upper chamber means committees at Holyrood play more central roles in pre-legislative scrutiny and amendment.

## Informal accountability: media, pressure groups and constituency links
Parliamentary scrutiny is amplified by informal channels. The mass media, specialist journalists and broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings bring ministerial actions and parliamentary debates into public view. Television and social media intensify this process: a viral clip of a committee hearing or a headline-critical interview can rapidly shape public reaction and political consequences. Pressure groups, trade unions and charities channel public concern into parliamentary pressure through lobbying, evidence submissions to committees and mass campaigns. Petitions, increasingly digital, can force parliamentary time for a debate or inquiry and draw attention to grassroots issues.

Constituency work connects accountability to local experience. MPs and MSPs hold surgeries, respond to constituents’ problems and raise local concerns in parliament. These local links put continual pressure on representatives to act and explain their decisions. The interplay between formal parliamentary mechanisms and these informal, often public-facing channels is crucial: scrutiny that is noticed by voters and commentators is more likely to produce political consequences.

## Limits and weaknesses of parliamentary accountability
Despite the variety of mechanisms, accountability is imperfect. Executive dominance is a recurrent theme in UK politics. Strong party discipline enforced by whips means that governments with majorities can usually secure passage of legislation and resist dissent. The timetable and control of government business limit backbenchers’ ability to set the agenda. Ministers may refuse to accept committee recommendations, and sanctions for non-compliance are often limited to reputation and publicity rather than legal compulsion.

Other constraints are institutional. Security, commercial confidentiality and certain legal restrictions mean some decision-making happens out of the full public eye. The House of Lords cannot block government legislation indefinitely, and Holyrood’s lack of a revising chamber shapes different legislative dynamics. The devolution settlement can complicate accountability when responsibilities overlap: reserved powers at Westminster interact with devolved powers in ways that make it difficult to attribute responsibility, especially on cross-cutting issues such as welfare or aspects of Brexit. Resource and capacity differences between committees and government departments also matter: limited research support can narrow the depth of scrutiny, particularly at Holyrood where staffing is smaller compared to Westminster.

Finally, the culture of accountability matters. Ministerial resignations for policy failures have become rarer, and political survival often depends on electoral considerations rather than adherence to norms of responsibility. The rise of short-term media cycles and spin can prioritise damage control over substantive answerability, leaving gaps between formal mechanisms and meaningful accountability.

## Case examples that illustrate differences and tensions
Exam-style answers are strengthened by concrete examples, and several recurring patterns help illuminate differences between Westminster and Holyrood. Question times show the contrast between spectacle and scrutiny: PMQs has a confrontational, headline-driven format, while FMQs tends to focus more on policy detail and sustained questioning. Committee work displays differing capacities: Westminster select committees have developed high-profile inquiries that can compel witness testimony and produce influential reports, while Holyrood committees often concentrate on thorough legislative examination and hold the Scottish Government to account on devolved policy delivery.

Devolution brings practical tensions. When UK-wide decisions affect devolved responsibilities, Scottish ministers may be held to account at Holyrood even though the final decision rests with Westminster. This dynamic was visible during periods of major constitutional change, where legislative consent and inter-parliamentary negotiation became central and sometimes contentious parts of accountability. The differing electoral systems — first past the post at Westminster and additional member system for Holyrood — also shape the partisan balance and therefore the strength of parliamentary scrutiny, with proportional representation in Scotland contributing to coalition or minority administrations that can change the relationship between government and parliament.

## Reform, adaptation and modern challenges
Parliaments do not stand still. Reforms to enhance transparency, strengthen committee resources and broaden public engagement are recurring responses to perceived accountability gaps. Enhanced publication of government data, expanding remote access to proceedings and introducing online petitioning have changed how citizens and parliament interact. New procedural tools have been introduced at times to improve scrutiny of secondary legislation and to respond to crises requiring urgent governmental action.

Contemporary challenges continue to test accountability arrangements. Rapid technological change, the growth of targeted political advertising, and the spread of misinformation complicate the information environment in which parliaments operate. Cross-border and global issues such as pandemics, climate change and complex trade negotiations demand inter-parliamentary coordination and new forms of oversight that bridge national and sub-national institutions. Students should be aware that the effectiveness of accountability depends on institutions, rules, resources and political culture — and that reform is often incremental and contested.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on parliamentary accountability, always begin by clarifying the focus of the question and tailoring your response to that focus. For extended-response questions, aim to structure your answer clearly: an introduction that defines accountability and frames the argument, several developed paragraphs that apply knowledge to the specific institutions or examples asked for, and a conclusion that reaches a supported judgement. Use up-to-date and relevant examples to illustrate points — refer to PMQs and FMQs, select committee reports, specific pieces of scrutiny, or well-known instances where accountability led to resignation or policy change. Avoid generic “pre-prepared” essays that do not directly address the stem of the question; markers reward relevance and precision.

For comparative questions, always set out the criteria you will use to compare Westminster and Holyrood and apply them consistently. Contrast the powers of committees, the impact of electoral systems, and the effect of devolution on responsibility. In evaluation, balance positive and negative points before reaching a decisive judgement that weighs their relative importance.

In source-based questions and Paper 2 tasks, the key skills are accuracy in using the sources and careful evaluation. For “detecting objectivity” questions, identify the standpoint of each source, the presence of loaded language or selective evidence, and explain how this affects objectivity. In “reliability” questions, consider authorship, purpose, date, and evidence used — and then reach an overall conclusion that compares the sources, referencing all three. Use quantitative qualifiers where required: avoid vague statements such as “to some extent”; instead say “largely reliable because…” and support that judgement with specific evidence from the sources.

When preparing the assignment, choose a contemporary, debatable issue that allows you to gather a range of sources and reach a supported decision. Use your research sheet effectively: include clearly attributed sources and key pieces of evidence, but do not put pre-written answers or knowledge on it. During the controlled write-up, explicitly draw on your research and demonstrate analysis and source evaluation. Make a clear decision or recommendation and explain why alternatives were discounted.

Time management is essential. For paper 1 (1 hour 45 minutes), plan the time you will spend on each question so you can develop full answers to the required 12- and 20-mark questions. For paper 2 (1 hour 15 minutes), practice interpreting and evaluating sources efficiently so you can allocate time to support, explanation and an overall conclusion. In all answers, integrate knowledge with evaluation: a list of facts without analysis will not score highly, but well-chosen facts used to support an evaluative point will.

Finally, practise writing under timed conditions, get comfortable using contemporary examples, and seek feedback to improve clarity and depth. A confident answer combines accurate knowledge, thoughtful evaluation and clear, well-structured communication — exactly the skills modern studies assessment seeks to reward.
