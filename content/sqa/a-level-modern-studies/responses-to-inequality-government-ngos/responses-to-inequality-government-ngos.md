# Responses to inequality: government and NGOs (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Understanding social inequality and why it matters
Social inequality refers to the uneven distribution of resources, opportunities and life chances across a society. It can be economic, measured by income and wealth; social, appearing through differences in education, health and housing; and political, when some groups have more influence than others. Inequality matters because it shapes people’s life outcomes—affecting education attainment, employment prospects, physical and mental health, and participation in civic life—and because large gaps can reduce social cohesion and economic stability. When you study responses to inequality, always link the problem (for example, persistent child poverty or regional disparities) to the outcomes it produces for individuals, communities and the state, since this helps you explain why particular policies are used and how their success should be judged.

## Measuring inequality: tools and limitations
There are several ways governments, researchers and NGOs measure inequality. The Gini coefficient summarises income distribution on a scale from complete equality to complete inequality, but it hides detail about who wins or loses. Relative poverty thresholds (for example, households earning below 60% of median income) capture how living standards compare within a society, while absolute measures track whether people can afford a basic standard of living. Other useful measures include the Palma ratio, which compares the top 10% share to the bottom 40%, and indicators of social mobility, health inequalities and educational attainment. Each measure has limits: income statistics may miss wealth or in-kind benefits, survey data can under-represent the poorest, and headline indicators obscure regional or ethnic variations. When evaluating responses to inequality, always state which measures are being used and consider what they reveal and what they hide.

## Theories of responses: individualism versus collectivism
Responses to inequality rest on competing theories about causes and solutions. An individualist or neoliberal approach sees inequality largely as the result of individual choices and market outcomes; policy therefore emphasises incentives, work-based support and reducing state intervention. A collectivist or social-democratic approach treats structural factors—market failures, discrimination, and unequal access to services—as central, so the state provides redistributive taxation, universal public services and welfare programmes to level the playing field. Other theoretical perspectives are helpful for analysis: functionalism explains inequality as serving economic roles (rewarding talent and motivating work), while conflict and structural theories argue that inequality reflects power imbalances and benefits elites. In essays, use these frameworks to explain why different actors favour particular policies and to evaluate whether those policies address root causes or merely symptoms.

## Government responses in the UK and Scotland: types and examples
Governments respond to inequality through a mixture of fiscal, service-provision and regulatory measures. Fiscal redistribution includes progressive taxation and benefits, designed to transfer resources from higher to lower earners. In the UK, welfare systems such as universal credit and state pensions form the backbone of income support, while national minimum and living wages are used to raise earnings. Public services—most notably healthcare via the NHS, state-funded schooling and housing programmes—aim to provide equal access. Scotland has additional devolved levers and policy choices: the Scottish Government has powers over certain welfare elements, housing strategy and education policies, and it has passed legislation such as the Child Poverty (Scotland) Act to set targets and coordinate action. Governments also use targeted interventions: early years programmes to reduce educational gaps, employment schemes and regional investment to tackle geographical disparities, and regulation to prevent discrimination. When analysing government action, consider three evaluation questions: does the policy reduce measured poverty or inequality; does it tackle underlying structural causes; and is it politically and economically sustainable?

## NGO responses: roles, strengths and limits
Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operate alongside government and play multiple roles in addressing inequality. Some NGOs provide frontline services—food banks, housing advice, debt counselling and legal aid—that meet immediate needs and fill gaps in state provision. Others specialise in research and advocacy, producing evidence, highlighting injustices and lobbying for policy change. International NGOs can support development and poverty reduction abroad while domestic charities often focus on social inclusion, health inequalities and community empowerment. NGOs bring strengths: local knowledge, flexibility, ability to innovate and to target hard-to-reach groups, and moral authority that can mobilise public support. However, NGOs face limits: they rely on donations, grants and contracts which can be unstable; they operate at a smaller scale than governments and therefore cannot replace universal public services; and their agendas can be shaped by funders or short-term crises. NGO effectiveness also depends on legal and political environments: some governments welcome partnership, while others restrict NGO activity. Evaluations of NGO responses should consider sustainability, accountability, and whether NGOs complement or inadvertently relieve governments of responsibility.

## Partnerships and comparative perspectives
The most effective responses often blend state action with NGO involvement. Multi-agency approaches—where government, NGOs, local authorities and private sector actors coordinate—can combine scale and expertise. For example, partnerships between local councils and charities can deliver community-based early intervention schemes or housing support, while national research bodies and NGOs can produce evidence that informs policy reform. International comparisons clarify policy choices: Nordic countries, with high levels of universal welfare provision and progressive taxation, tend to have lower measured inequality and higher social mobility than liberal market systems like the UK or US, though they also have higher tax burdens and different cultural contexts. Emerging economies may combine targeted cash transfers with public employment schemes to reduce extreme poverty. When making comparisons in essays, avoid simplistic judgements; instead, explain institutional differences, funding models and political values that shape outcomes, and evaluate transferability of policies between contexts.

## Evaluating effectiveness: evidence, trade-offs and unintended consequences
Judging whether responses to inequality work requires careful use of evidence and awareness of trade-offs. Short-term indicators such as reduced poverty rates or increased benefit uptake show immediate impact, but longer-term effects on social mobility, health outcomes and employment matter most for lasting change. Policies can have unintended consequences: benefits designed to incentivise work may create complexity and ‘cliff edges’; targeted charity provision may relieve acute need but entrench a two-tier system; austerity measures that cut services can increase hidden poverty. Cost-effectiveness is crucial—limited public resources force choices between universal services and targeted support—so evaluation must consider value for money and opportunity costs. Use case studies to illustrate points: the impact of a targeted school breakfast programme on pupil attainment, or the role of foodbanks where welfare changes have left gaps. Critical evaluation should balance evidence of success against limitations in scale, sustainability and whether the intervention addresses structural causes.

## Research and source evaluation in this topic
Good answers rely on a range of trustworthy evidence. Official statistics—government poverty reports, income distribution data and benefit take-up figures—are essential, but they require scrutiny for measurement choices and time lags. Academic research and think-tank reports offer analysis and theory but can differ in assumptions and methods. NGO reports provide frontline insight and case studies, though they may emphasise particular narratives to support campaigning aims. Primary methods such as surveys, interviews and focus groups can enrich understanding of lived experience; however, issues of sampling, response bias and ethics must be considered. In source-based questions, assess provenance (who produced the source and why), methodology (how was data collected), timeliness and scope. When planning project work or dissertation research, combine quantitative measures (income data, deprivation indices) with qualitative evidence (interviews, case studies) to build a nuanced picture of both outcomes and mechanisms.

## Exam technique
Begin essays with a clear definition of key terms—what you mean by inequality and the specific response under discussion—and state the comparative frame (for example, Scotland/UK versus another country). Structure your answer with a logical line of argument: explain the rationale for a response, provide up-to-date and relevant examples (policy names, NGO programmes or country comparisons), and analyse using theoretical frameworks such as individualism versus collectivism. For 30-mark extended responses, aim to develop balanced analysis and sustained evaluation across several paragraphs, using paragraphs as mini-arguments that link evidence to the central claim. In research methods questions, compare the strengths and weaknesses of the methods named and suggest improvements or alternative approaches, referring to ethics and validity. For source-based trustworthiness questions, evaluate provenance, methodology, possible bias, and whether the source is corroborated by other evidence. Always reach a reasoned conclusion that answers the question directly rather than merely summarising points. Where appropriate, use comparative language (“to a greater extent in Sweden than in the UK”) and quantify outcomes when possible, but avoid unsupported generalisations. Finally, practise timing in exam conditions, plan answers briefly before writing, and revise exemplar essays and dissertations to internalise strong structures and evaluation techniques.
