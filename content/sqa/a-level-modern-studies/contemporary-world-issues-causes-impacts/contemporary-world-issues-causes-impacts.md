# Contemporary world issues: causes, impacts and international responses (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Course purpose and structure: what you need to know
This course is designed to deepen your understanding of the contemporary world and the political and social processes that shape it. You will study three broad areas: democracy in Scotland and the United Kingdom, social issues in the United Kingdom (focusing on either social inequality or crime and the law), and international issues (focusing on either a major world power or a significant contemporary world issue). Assessment is built to test knowledge, analysis and evaluation across these areas through two externally set question papers and an externally marked assignment. Question paper 1 (52 marks, 1 hour 45 minutes) asks you to produce extended responses from the three sections of the course, question paper 2 (28 marks, 1 hour 15 minutes) focuses on interpreting and evaluating sources, and the assignment (30 marks) requires independent research, synthesis and a reasoned decision written under controlled conditions. Understanding the demands of each component helps you shape both classroom learning and revision.

## Causes of contemporary world issues
Contemporary world issues rarely have a single cause; they arise from a mixture of political, economic, social and cultural factors that interact in complex ways. Political factors can include contested governance arrangements, weak institutions, corruption or the fallout from wars and revolutions. Economic drivers are often central: unemployment, poverty, unequal distribution of wealth and austerity measures create grievances and can deepen social problems. Social and cultural issues such as discrimination based on race, gender or ethnicity influence outcomes in health, education and employment, and can perpetuate cycles of disadvantage. Environmental pressures, demographic change and technological shifts also play crucial roles: resource scarcity or rapid urbanisation can heighten tensions, while social media and targeted online communications can amplify polarisation or spread misinformation. In the context of the UK, causes of political debates such as independence, or the long-run impacts of the UK’s choice to leave the EU, are shaped by regional identity, economic interest, historical relationships and differing media narratives. At the international level, causes may include colonial legacies, competition for strategic resources, foreign interventions, and the global imbalance between rich and poor states.

## Impacts on individuals, communities and states
The effects of contemporary issues operate at multiple levels. For individuals, social inequality can lead to poorer health outcomes, limited educational attainment and restricted life chances. Crime affects victims through trauma and financial loss, and offenders through stigmatization and limited future opportunities after custodial sentences. Families and communities suffer from breakdowns in trust, reduced investment and the erosion of social cohesion; entire neighbourhoods can fall into persistent cycles of poverty and crime. States face fiscal pressure when social problems require long-term welfare support or when conflict and instability disrupt economic activity. Politically, unresolved social and international issues can delegitimise governments, fuel populist movements and complicate democratic accountability. Internationally, issues such as large-scale migration, regional conflicts or pandemics can strain diplomatic relations, disrupt trade and trigger varied responses from the international community, ranging from humanitarian aid to sanctions and military intervention. Importantly, the human cost should always be central to analysis: statistics about inequality or refugees represent lived experiences that shape political responses and public attitudes.

## International responses and the role of organisations
Responses to international problems are taken at national, regional and global levels, and the effectiveness of each response depends on political will, resources and legal frameworks. Nation-states can deploy military force, negotiate treaties, impose sanctions or offer humanitarian and development aid. Regional bodies such as the European Union or the African Union coordinate policies, implement economic programmes and sometimes undertake peacekeeping or mediation. Global institutions, mainly the United Nations and its agencies, aim to provide legitimacy, coordinate multilateral action and deliver humanitarian assistance; NATO can provide security guarantees and collective defence, while specialised organisations address health, food security and development. Each actor has strengths and limitations: multilateral actions can gain broad legitimacy but are slow and constrained by competing interests, while unilateral national actions may be swift but can provoke regional instability. Evaluating the effectiveness of responses requires attention to measurable outcomes—reduced violence, improved public health, restored governance—and less tangible factors such as legitimacy, sustainability and unintended consequences. For example, sanctions may pressure regimes but can also harm civilian populations, and peacekeeping missions can stabilize regions but sometimes lack the mandate or resources to address root causes.

## Case studies and comparative approaches
Using case studies strengthens understanding because they ground abstract concepts in real events. Comparative study is encouraged: contrast the devolved settlement in Scotland with other arrangements such as federal systems or unitary states to appreciate different methods of representation and accountability. When studying social inequality, compare the impact of welfare measures in the UK with those in another G20 member to see how policy choices shape outcomes. For international issues, selecting a world power such as the United States, China or Germany allows you to analyse democratic participation, institutional power, socio-economic inequality and international influence within a coherent framework. When choosing a contemporary world issue—for example mass displacement in a region, climate-related migration, or a protracted conflict—examine causes, effects on civilians and state capacity, national responses and the role of international organisations. Comparative work sharpens evaluation: it draws attention to alternative policies, enables judgements about transferability of solutions and helps explain why similar problems provoke different responses in different contexts.

## Research, sources and the assignment
Research skills are central to the assignment and to success in the source-based question paper. The assignment requires you to research a contemporary issue that provokes alternative views and to produce a concise, evidence-based report under controlled conditions. The research sheet is your working document: it must be no more than two sides of A4, should list the specific sources you used with clear attribution (author, date, title, publication) and should not contain pre-prepared analysis or a full report plan. Good research sheets include a range of reputable sources—official statistics, academic or think-tank analysis, reputable newspapers, reports from NGOs or international organisations—and key extracts or factual points you will use as evidence. During research you should evaluate each source for reliability by considering authorship, purpose, date, potential bias, method of data collection and intended audience. When using numerical or graphical information, interpret trends carefully and refer to the limitations of the data. The assignment’s production stage is completed in one sitting under supervision, so it is essential to have organised your research and be clear about your argument. Copying large sections from sources will not earn analysis marks; examiners look for synthesis, judgement and a well-supported decision that recognises alternatives and limitations.

## Teaching and learning approaches to develop skills
Teaching should build skills progressively through a mix of guided research, structured debate and source practice. Start by ensuring learners understand key concepts—participation, representation, rights and responsibilities—then use local and Scottish examples to make abstract ideas concrete. Encourage active learning through class debates, mock parliamentary procedures, visits to civic institutions and projects that involve contacting local representatives. Source skills are best taught through repeated practice: set up exercises that require you to detect bias, assess objectivity, weigh evidence and draw conclusions from mixed sources including graphs and infographics. Numeracy is embedded in source handling; analysing election results, income distribution tables or health statistics trains you to use figures as evidence rather than as unsupported claims. Where possible, integrate international comparisons and current events so that learners can see how policies and responses play out in different places. Feedback is crucial: teachers should model how to structure an extended answer, give targeted comments on analysis and evaluation, and help learners convert background knowledge into focused responses that match the question’s demands.

## Exam technique
Approach each exam question by reading carefully and planning your answer to fit the question rather than relying on pre-prepared essays. For extended-response questions, begin with a brief planning paragraph that frames your argument and signals the points you will cover, then use evidence and explanation to develop each point and finish with a concise evaluative conclusion that directly answers the question. In source-based papers, treat each source as an evidence item: when asked to draw conclusions, synthesise details across sources and use them to justify a clear judgement; when asked about objectivity, show how language, source purpose, selection of facts and omissions shape perspective; when evaluating reliability, comment on authorship, date, method and possible bias for each source before making a comparative overall judgement. Avoid vague phrases such as “to a certain extent”; be specific—quantify where appropriate and explain why a source’s currency or origin matters. Time management is essential: allocate time according to the marks available and leave a few minutes to check that your conclusion reflects the evidence presented. For the assignment, use the research stage to assemble a rich but properly attributed set of sources, and ensure your research sheet is usable under timed conditions; during the production stage write clearly in report form, include relevant knowledge throughout to frame your analysis, evaluate the sources you used, and make a well-argued recommendation that acknowledges alternatives. Practise past-style questions under timed conditions and seek targeted feedback so that your exam technique becomes instinctive on the day.
