# Crime, law and justice: causes and responses (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Why study crime, law and justice?
Crime, law and justice are central to understanding how societies manage conflict, protect rights and maintain order. Studying this topic at Higher Modern Studies develops your ability to explain why people commit crime, how the legal system responds, and what the social and economic consequences of crime are for individuals and communities. This area of study also gives you opportunities to apply political and sociological ideas to real-world problems, to evaluate evidence and policy, and to form balanced judgements about competing responses — all skills that are examined in both question paper work and the assignment. For Scotland and the wider UK, questions about justice are not only academic: they shape public policy, influence elections and affect everyday life, so using up-to-date examples and clear analysis is essential.

## Legal rights and the Scottish/UK justice framework
A clear starting point is the legal rights every citizen is supposed to enjoy and the institutions that give effect to those rights. Fundamental principles such as presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial and access to legal representation are central to modern criminal justice. Scotland has a distinct legal system and its own courts, policing structures and sentencing practices. The Scottish Parliament holds substantial responsibility for policing and many aspects of criminal justice, so decisions taken in Holyrood can differ from those in Westminster. In practice, the justice system involves police forces who investigate crime, prosecutors who decide whether to bring cases, courts that determine guilt and impose sentences, and prisons or community services that carry out punishments and rehabilitation. Understanding how these parts fit together and how devolved powers shape policy is essential when evaluating responses to crime.

## Causes and theories of crime
Explaining why crime happens requires engagement with a range of theories. Biological explanations historically argued that criminals might possess physical or genetic traits that predispose them to offending, but such accounts are now seen as limited and often deterministic. Psychological theories focus on individual factors such as personality, cognitive development, impulsivity, mental health problems or experiences of trauma that can increase the risk of offending. Sociological theories emphasise the social context: strain theory shows how relative deprivation and blocked legitimate opportunities can pressure people into crime; subcultural theory explains how peer groups can normalise offending; labelling theory highlights how being labelled as a “criminal” can lead to further offending; and social disorganisation theory links high crime rates to neighbourhoods with weak social cohesion and limited informal social control. The debate between individualist approaches (which stress personal responsibility and choice) and collectivist approaches (which stress social structures, inequality and the role of the state) runs through much of how policies are justified. Good answers will show how different explanations can interact — for example, how poverty and poor schooling (structural factors) may combine with individual trauma to increase risk of offending.

## Impact of crime on victims, offenders, families and society
The consequences of crime are multi-layered. Victims can suffer immediate physical harm, long-term psychological trauma, financial loss and a loss of confidence in public safety. Families of victims may face disruption and emotional strain. Offenders themselves are affected through criminal records, imprisonment, reduced employment prospects and social stigma; incarceration can damage family ties and increase the risk of reoffending on release. Communities can experience economic decline if businesses and investment are deterred, and local services can be stretched by the need for policing and social interventions. At a societal level, crime imposes direct costs in policing, courts and custodial provision, and indirect costs in lost productivity and treatment for victims. Public perceptions of crime — amplified by media coverage — can also shape political priorities and lead to punitive policy swings even when statistics do not support an overall crime surge. A good grasp of these layers helps you evaluate policy trade-offs between protecting victims, reducing offending and safeguarding rights.

## Responses: custodial and non-custodial measures
Responses to crime fall broadly into custodial and non-custodial categories, each with different aims and consequences. Custodial sentences — short-term and long-term imprisonment — can incapacitate offenders and satisfy demands for retribution, but they are costly and may have limited rehabilitative effect. Over-reliance on custody can contribute to prison overcrowding and high recidivism if release is not accompanied by meaningful support. Non-custodial measures include fines, community sentences, electronic monitoring, restorative justice and diversion schemes. In Scotland, community-based sentences such as Community Payback Orders are a central non-custodial tool intended to provide punishment, reparation and rehabilitation while keeping offenders connected to their communities. Youth justice approaches typically emphasise early intervention, diversion from formal justice processes and measures that address the causes of offending, such as family support and education. Policing strategies also vary from traditional reactive models to community policing, problem-oriented policing and initiatives to build trust with marginalised groups. Restorative justice, which brings victims and offenders together to agree on reparation, can increase victim satisfaction and reduce reoffending in suitable cases. When describing responses, be ready to give contemporary Scottish or UK examples and to explain the intended aims of each approach.

## Evaluating effectiveness: criteria and evidence
Assessing how well a policy works requires clear criteria. Common criteria include reductions in crime rates and reoffending, improvements in victim satisfaction and community safety, cost-effectiveness, respect for human rights, and long-term social outcomes such as employment and health. Evidence should be used carefully: recidivism statistics can indicate whether a response reduces reoffending, but they must be interpreted in context, and short-term falls in crime can reflect displacement or changes in reporting rather than true reductions. Cost-benefit analysis helps when comparing expensive custodial provision with community alternatives. Comparative examples can be illuminating: countries that emphasise rehabilitation and social reintegration often report lower reoffending rates than more punitive systems, though cultural and institutional differences complicate direct comparisons. In addition, political feasibility and public confidence matter; a policy that is highly effective but politically unacceptable may be difficult to sustain. A balanced evaluation recognises strengths and weaknesses, uses evidence where possible, and considers unintended consequences — for instance, how strict sentencing can lead to social exclusion that increases the likelihood of further crime.

## Researching for the assignment: sources and structure
When preparing an assignment on crime and the law, selecting and using sources effectively is critical. Your research sheet should list the specific articles, reports, statistics and legal texts you used, with author, title and date, and should avoid being a plan or a pre-written argument. Use a mix of official sources such as government crime statistics and reports from criminal justice agencies, academic research that explains causes and evaluates interventions, and reputable media reports to illustrate public debate and recent cases. For Scottish-focused work, include material that reflects the distinct legal and policy context. In the assignment itself, frame the issue clearly, use knowledge to set context, and deploy evidence from your research to analyse options and support a reasoned decision or recommendation. Be explicit when evaluating the reliability of your sources — for example, consider whether a government report offers comprehensive statistics, whether a charity’s report reflects an advocacy position, or whether recent academic work has peer review. The assignment is also an opportunity to show that you can synthesise evidence, acknowledge alternative views and reach a justified conclusion.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on crime, law and justice well requires careful planning, relevant examples and precise use of evidence. For extended-response questions, start with a brief definition and context, then develop a balanced argument that links theory to examples, and finish with a clear evaluation or judgement. Avoid writing pre-prepared essays that do not address the exact wording of the question; tailor your content to the focus requested (for instance, causes, impacts, or effectiveness). In source-based questions, use only the material provided and make sure your conclusion follows logically from the sources. For the assignment, use your research sheet actively but remember that the production stage must be your own unaided work; cite your sources on the sheet and demonstrate analysis rather than copying. Time management is vital in exams: allocate time to plan, write and check responses, and ensure that 12-mark and 20-mark questions include both developed knowledge and evaluation. Always aim to link back to the assessment criteria: show knowledge, use evidence to analyse, and make reasoned evaluative judgements that integrate the social and political dimensions of crime, law and justice.
