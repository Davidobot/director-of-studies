# Advanced Higher project-dissertation skills (A-level Modern Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Why this course and what the project is for
Advanced Higher Modern Studies builds on Higher study to allow you to explore complex, contemporary political and social issues in depth. The course develops the ability to think independently, to research systematically, and to present sustained argumentation using a multidisciplinary social science approach. The project–dissertation is the key opportunity to demonstrate these abilities: it is a piece of independent research of up to 5,000 words in which you justify a research question, gather and analyse evidence, evaluate methods, and reach a balanced conclusion. The project is worth 50 marks, about 36% of the overall course assessment, with the remaining 64% assessed through a three‑hour question paper that tests knowledge, comparative skills and research methods understanding.

## Choosing and sharpening a dissertation topic
Selecting the right topic is the most important early decision. Your topic should be contemporary, relevant to Modern Studies, and framed so that it allows in‑depth analysis rather than mere description. Think in terms of questions that invite evaluation, such as “To what extent…?”, “How effectively…?”, or “What explains…?”. Avoid vague stems like “To find out…”. A strong title will locate the issue in context and make clear the comparative or theoretical lens you plan to use. For example, instead of “Crime in Scotland”, a sharper title would be “To what extent have community policing strategies reduced violent crime in urban Scotland compared to a similar city elsewhere?” This phrasing signals the scope of inquiry, the comparative approach, and the likely methods you will need. Your teacher can advise on feasibility and resource availability, and you should consider whether primary research is realistic and ethical for your chosen topic. Remember that the dissertation does not have to include primary data, but well‑integrated primary evidence can strengthen your work if done properly.

## Research methods: choosing, using and evaluating them
A hallmark of Advanced Higher is the explicit requirement to show understanding of social science research methods. You should be familiar with a range of approaches: analysis of official statistics, postal and online surveys, structured and semi‑structured interviews, focus groups, overt and covert observation, case studies and longitudinal studies. The key is to choose methods that suit your research question and to be able to justify their selection. For each method you use or discuss, consider practical benefits, common limitations, and ethical implications. For example, an online survey can reach many respondents quickly and provide quantitative patterns, but it may suffer from self‑selection bias and limited depth. A semi‑structured interview offers rich insight into individual attitudes but is time‑consuming and difficult to generalise from. Demonstrating awareness of reliability and validity concerns and planning how to mitigate them through sampling, triangulation, or careful question design shows maturity in research thinking. Ethical issues must be addressed explicitly: consent, anonymity, potential harm to participants and data security are not optional considerations. When you evaluate methods in the dissertation, move beyond description to critique, showing how each method shaped your findings and how your approach might be improved in future research.

## Assessing and synthesising sources
Good dissertations and strong exam answers rely on judicious use of sources. You will routinely encounter official reports, academic literature, media outputs, think‑tank analyses, statistical databases and, where applicable, primary documents or interview transcripts. Assessing the trustworthiness of a source involves examining provenance, methodology, authorial position, date, and potential biases. Official statistics can be authoritative, but they may mask undercounting or definitional changes over time. Media pieces can illustrate contemporary framing but often require cross‑checking. Academic articles provide theory and peer‑reviewed evidence, yet their applicability to your case study must be addressed. Triangulation—using multiple types of sources to test an argument—strengthens credibility and allows you to synthesise different strands of evidence into a coherent argument. Appendices are important: transcripts, questionnaires, and raw survey data should be included where relevant, but only extracts you analyse in the main body will attract marks. Always integrate and reference appendix material in the text so it is part of your argument rather than an unexamined addendum.

## Planning, time management and authenticity
The Advanced Higher project is conducted under some supervision. You are expected to work independently while your teacher provides guidance and monitors progress. Begin by producing a clear plan with milestones for literature review, data collection, analysis and drafting. Regular checkpoint meetings or short progress interviews are typical ways teachers authenticate the work and help prevent problems such as scope creep. Where group research is used during the investigative phase, remember that the final dissertation must be wholly your own work. Centres may offer “reasonable assistance” such as help with submission dates or generic advice, but personalised help that alters the candidate’s arguments or analysis undermines authenticity. Keep detailed records of your research process: a log of contacts, dates of interviews, consent forms and versions of drafts provides evidence of independent work and is useful if any questions about authenticity arise. Be realistic about the time required for good editing and proof‑reading; a polished final submission is easier to read and tends to score higher because arguments are clearer and evidence is better signposted.

## Writing and formatting the dissertation
The dissertation should present a sustained and coherent line of argument. A clear introduction must set out your research question, rationale, hypothesis or aims and outline the structure that follows. The literature review should situate your topic within relevant theory and prior research, identifying gaps your dissertation addresses. The methods section needs to justify the choices you made and explain how data were collected and analysed; an evaluative element here is required, not simply descriptive detail. The analysis chapters should integrate evidence and theory, moving from description to explanation and evaluation and using comparative material where appropriate. A conclusion must be more than a summary; it should offer a balanced judgement about your question, referring explicitly to the evidence and to limitations of the study. Conventions matter: adopt a consistent referencing style, use size 12 font and 1.5 spacing as recommended, and include an overall word count on the title page. The word limit is 5,000 words for the body of the dissertation and the evaluation of research methods; this excludes the contents page, bibliography, footnotes and appendices. Staying within the limit is important: exceeding it by more than 10% attracts a penalty. Proofread carefully and ensure pages are single‑sided if required by your centre.

## Assessment, grading and what examiners look for
Course assessment combines the three‑hour question paper and the project–dissertation. The question paper contributes 90 marks and tests political issues, law and order, social inequality and research methods through extended responses and source evaluation. The project accounts for 50 marks and evaluates your capacity for independent research, method evaluation, evidence use and sustained argument. Examiners look for a clear line of argument, well‑selected and up‑to‑date examples, critical evaluation of sources and methods, and a conclusion that directly addresses the research question. For the question paper, high marks come from argument that is tailored to the specific question rather than a pre‑prepared essay shoehorned into the prompt. Comparative analysis is fundamental: when a question asks for reference to the UK or Scotland and another country, explicit, well‑integrated comparisons are expected. For the research methods and source questions, demonstrate knowledge of suitability, reliability, validity, and ethical issues, and use examples from your own experience or well‑known case studies where possible. Overall grades are awarded on combined marks for both components, and performance is reported on an A–D scale.

## Exam technique
Approach the exam and the dissertation with planning, clarity and evidence. For the question paper, spend time reading the chosen section carefully and plan essays before writing. A strong answer begins with a concise introduction that sets out the argument and the points to be covered. Each paragraph should make a clear point, use relevant evidence or theory, evaluate competing explanations and link back to the central argument. Avoid the temptation to write what you know in general; use the specific wording of the question to shape your response. Time management in the three‑hour paper is essential: allocate time for planning, writing and a final read‑through. In research methods questions, explicitly state the strengths and limitations of methods in relation to the scenario given, and propose practical improvements or alternative approaches. For source evaluation, examine provenance, purpose, content, methodology and potential bias, drawing on both the source and your wider knowledge of research practices.

For the dissertation, begin by drafting an outline proposal and seek early feedback on feasibility. Keep aims measurable and focused, and justify methodological choices. As you collect evidence, keep analytical notes and draft sections iteratively rather than leaving all writing to the end. When evaluating your methods, be concrete: explain how sampling influenced results, what ethical trade‑offs you faced, and how triangulation altered your confidence in findings. Use appendices purposefully and make sure every appendix referenced in the text contributes to your argument. Before submission, check formatting, word counts and referencing consistency, and ensure your conclusion offers a considered judgement rather than a narrative recap. Finally, treat feedback opportunities seriously: use teacher comments on draft material to refine clarity and strengthen your analysis. Sustained planning, critical reflexivity about methods and evidence, and disciplined presentation are what separate good work from excellent work.
