# Morality and Justice: punishment, causes of crime and responses (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why study punishment, causes of crime and responses
Understanding punishment, the causes of crime and the range of responses used by society is central to questions about fairness, safety and human dignity. This topic asks you to think about why societies punish, what leads people to commit offences, and whether current systems achieve their aims. At National 5 level you will be expected to describe different purposes of punishment, explain common causes of crime, outline how the UK responds to offending and evaluate those responses from religious and non‑religious viewpoints. Real examples — such as community sentences, restorative justice conferences, or debates about life sentences — help turn abstract ideas into things that affect real people and communities.

## The purposes of punishment: retribution, deterrence, reformation and protection
Punishment is not a single idea but a cluster of purposes that can guide law and sentencing. Retribution is the idea that wrongdoers deserve to suffer in proportion to the harm they have caused; it appeals to a sense of moral balancing. Deterrence aims to put people off committing crimes: specific deterrence discourages the same individual from re‑offending, while general deterrence aims to warn the wider public. Reformation (or rehabilitation) focuses on changing behaviour so that offenders can re‑enter society without committing further crimes; this can involve education, therapy, addiction treatment or skills training. Protection, sometimes called incapacitation, removes dangerous people from the community for as long as they pose a threat, often through imprisonment.

Different purposes pull in different directions. A sentence designed mainly for retribution may be short and harsh; a sentence focused on reformation may combine supervision with programmes to address offending behaviour. In practice judges and policymakers balance these aims, and tensions arise when, for example, public desire for punishment clashes with evidence that certain types of short custodial sentences increase reoffending.

## Causes of crime: poverty, environment and psychological factors
Explaining why people commit crimes requires looking at a range of social and personal influences. Poverty and economic inequality are often linked to property crimes such as theft and to environments in which people have limited access to legitimate opportunities. Areas with high unemployment, poor housing and limited youth services can create pressures and reduce the sense that crime is avoidable. Environmental factors include peer groups, gang culture, exposure to violence and poor schooling; these shape attitudes, opportunities and the immediate choices young people face. Psychological factors range from substance misuse and impulsivity to diagnosed mental health problems and personality disorders; trauma and adverse childhood experiences can also increase the likelihood of offending.

It is important to avoid simplistic cause‑and‑effect claims: not everyone who experiences poverty or trauma commits offences, and many offenders do not fit single explanations. Effective explanations usually combine social, economic and psychological factors. Recognising complexity helps when designing responses that address root causes as well as individual responsibility.

## UK responses to crime: custodial and non‑custodial sentences, prevention and rehabilitation
The UK uses a mix of custodial sentences, non‑custodial measures and preventative strategies. Custodial sentences range from short terms in prison to life sentences with a judicially set minimum term (tariff) and, in rare cases, whole life orders which mean no release. Prisons are justified by protection and retribution, but critics point to overcrowding, the damaging effects of imprisonment on families, and evidence that short custodial sentences can increase reoffending because of loss of employment, social ties and exposure to criminal networks.

Non‑custodial sentences include community payback orders, electronic monitoring, curfews, probation supervision, fines and restorative justice processes in which offenders meet victims to make amends. These measures tend to focus on reformation and repair rather than simple punishment. Restorative justice can reduce reoffending and gives victims a voice; community sentences can combine punishment with education, drug treatment and practical requirements such as unpaid work.

Crime prevention is another strand of response. Situational prevention aims to reduce opportunities for offences through measures such as better street lighting, secure housing, target hardening and CCTV. Social prevention seeks long‑term change through investment in education, youth services, jobs and family support. Policing strategies and early intervention programmes for at‑risk young people also form part of the prevention mix.

When evaluating responses it helps to look at outcomes such as recidivism rates, victims’ satisfaction, social costs and whether measures treat people fairly. Policy debate in the UK often centres on the balance between punishment and rehabilitation, and on how best to protect communities while reducing future crime.

## Capital punishment and life tariffs: humaneness and human rights
The UK has abolished capital punishment for murder; this historical change frames current debates about the ethics of the death penalty. Supporters of capital punishment argue it can deliver final retribution and deter the most serious crimes, while opponents emphasise the risk of wrongful conviction, the moral problem of the state taking life, and the absence of convincing evidence that execution deters more effectively than long sentences. Human rights arguments commonly invoke the right to life and the principle that punishment should not be cruel or degrading.

Life tariffs in the UK mean that a person sentenced to life imprisonment receives a minimum term set by the court. After the tariff they may be considered for release by the parole system; some offenders receive whole life orders and will never be released. Debates about life tariffs focus on proportionality, public protection and the possibility of rehabilitation. Critics of very long or whole life orders argue these can undermine hope and human dignity, while supporters say some crimes are so grave that permanent incapacitation is the only acceptable response.

## Evaluating effectiveness, fairness and wider ethical issues
Judging whether punishment and responses to crime are successful requires careful evaluation. A criminal justice policy may be effective at reducing reoffending, but unfair in its application; for example, data consistently show that some minority groups are disproportionately represented in prison populations, raising concerns about bias and systemic inequality. Measures that focus narrowly on punishment may bring short‑term public reassurance but produce long‑term social costs if they fail to address causes such as addiction, unemployment and trauma.

Ethical evaluation also asks whether responses respect human rights and the potential for change. Rehabilitation‑oriented approaches are favoured by many evidence reviews because they address the factors that lead to reoffending and can reduce overall crime. Prevention through social investment tackles root causes and can be more cost‑effective over time, but it requires sustained political will. Restorative justice is ethically attractive to many because it centers victims and encourages accountability, though it is not suitable for every offence or every victim.

A balanced policy perspective recognises that different offences and offenders require different responses: protection may be necessary where there is ongoing danger, reformation appropriate where change is possible, and deterrence relevant for certain patterns of offending. The best strategies combine proportionate punishment with rehabilitation, support for families and communities, and crime prevention that reduces the causes of offending.

## Religious and non‑religious responses to punishment and justice
Religious traditions contribute distinct but sometimes overlapping views on justice. Many Christian teachings emphasise forgiveness and the possibility of repentance, so reformation and restorative justice are often seen as morally important; at the same time, some Christian perspectives acknowledge a role for retributive justice in upholding moral order. Islamic legal and ethical thought stresses both justice and mercy, supporting fair punishment while encouraging repentance and rehabilitation. Jewish thought has a complex tradition that values the rule of law, communal responsibility and repair. Many other faiths highlight compassion, the sanctity of life and the need to restore relationships damaged by wrongdoing.

Non‑religious viewpoints vary. Utilitarian or consequentialist approaches justify punishment according to its effects on future harm, emphasising deterrence and rehabilitation when these reduce crime and social cost. Humanist and rights‑based perspectives prioritise human dignity and oppose inhumane treatments such as the death penalty, arguing that punishment should protect rights and offer opportunities for reform. In practice, religious and non‑religious voices often agree on practical measures such as support for victims, rehabilitation programmes and the importance of reducing social inequalities that lead to crime, even when they differ in the moral language they deploy.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on morality and justice, aim to demonstrate three linked skills: clear knowledge, straightforward analysis and balanced evaluation. For knowledge, describe key terms and ideas in your own words: define purposes of punishment, outline causes of crime, and identify UK responses such as custodial and community sentences. Use examples to support your points — for instance, explain that restorative justice involves victim‑offender dialogue, or that life tariffs set a minimum term for release. For analysis, make connections: explain how poverty can increase opportunity for theft, or how short prison sentences may disrupt employment and increase recidivism. Explain implications and consider consequences rather than simply listing facts.

For evaluation, reach a reasoned judgement that weighs strengths and weaknesses. Discuss benefits and drawbacks: a custodial sentence protects the public but can be costly and counterproductive if too short; community sentences may better support rehabilitation but might not satisfy public demands for punishment. Bring in religious and non‑religious perspectives to show breadth: mention, for example, a Christian emphasis on forgiveness or a humanist concern with rights. Use "switch" phrases to signal skills: start descriptions with "One way…" or "For example…", begin analysis with "This suggests…" or "As a result…" and introduce evaluation with "A strength is…" or "However, a problem is…".

Plan your answer before you write. For a longer question, spend a few minutes outlining your points and decide which examples to use. In timed papers, divide time so you have time for description, analysis and a short conclusion that gives a balanced judgement. For the assignment, choose an issue you know well, include at least two sources, state your issue clearly, and prepare a concise RMPS Resource Sheet (no more than 200 words) to bring into the supervised writing stage. Remember that examiners reward answers that are accurate, well explained and that show an ability to think about different viewpoints and consequences.
