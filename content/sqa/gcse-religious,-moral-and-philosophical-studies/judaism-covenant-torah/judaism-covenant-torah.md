# Judaism: Covenant, Torah and worship (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why covenant, Torah and worship matter
Covenant, Torah and worship lie at the heart of Jewish identity. Together they explain how Jews understand their relationship with God, how they live in response to that relationship, and how they express it communally and individually. The idea of covenant (brit) gives a story and purpose: a people chosen to live under God’s guidance. The Torah provides the rules, stories and teachings that shape daily life and moral decisions. Worship—in the synagogue, at home and through life-cycle rituals—makes those beliefs tangible. For National 5 study, it is helpful to see these three themes as connected: covenant gives the reason, Torah gives the instruction, and worship is one of the main ways the covenant is remembered and the Torah is lived out.

## The Covenant: promises, history and meaning
The covenant is a binding relationship between God and the Jewish people, expressed in several key moments in the Hebrew scriptures. Two covenants are especially important for teaching and revision. The covenant with Abraham establishes a promise of land, descendants and blessing; its sign is circumcision (brit milah). This gives Judaism a primordial identity as a people chosen for a relationship with God. The covenant at Sinai, made after the Exodus from Egypt and given through Moses, is the central legal and moral charter: God gives the people the Torah and they accept the obligations of obedience. The Sinai covenant is presented in Exodus and Deuteronomy and is often described by rabbis as a covenant of law: God’s self-revelation is matched by Israel’s acceptance of mitzvot (commandments).

Understanding covenant is helped by contrasting it with a secular contract. A contract is transactional and often revocable; the biblical covenant is framed as enduring, involving promises and signs and often repeated remembrance in worship and festivals. In practice, covenant theology explains why Jewish worship includes annual retelling of the Exodus at Passover and why communal life is organised around laws and festivals that renew the covenantal bond.

## The Torah: written, oral and lived
The Torah is most commonly used to mean the five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), the foundational narrative and legal corpus of Judaism. In a wider sense Torah can mean all Jewish teaching, and in religious usage “the Written Torah” (the Pentateuch) is complemented by the “Oral Torah.” The Oral Torah consists of the Mishnah (a compilation of rabbinic teachings around c. 200 CE) and the Gemara; together they form the Talmud, which is the central text of rabbinic interpretation. This rabbinic tradition arose especially after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, when Judaism shifted from temple-centred sacrifice to study, prayer and law as the focus of religious life.

The Torah contains narrative, law and ethical teaching and provides the basis for halakhah (Jewish law). Traditional Judaism counts 613 mitzvot, commandments that cover ritual, ethical and civil life. For National 5 study it is useful to know examples rather than memorise the full list: dietary laws (kashrut), Sabbath observance, laws about charity, rules governing justice and ritual obligations such as prayer and family purity. The Torah is kept in a scroll (Sefer Torah) and handled with care and reverence. The public reading of the Torah in the synagogue, particularly on Shabbat and festivals, exemplifies how the Written and Oral Torah operate together: the Torah text is read and the rabbinic tradition interprets how to apply it.

## Living according to the Torah: practices and everyday implications
Living according to the Torah means translating commandments into everyday practice. Observance of the Sabbath (Shabbat) is one of the clearest examples: for many Jews it is the weekly sign of covenantal life, a day of rest and worship from Friday evening to Saturday evening when work is refrained from and family, prayer and study are prioritised. Dietary laws (kashrut) structure eating and social life by distinguishing permitted and forbidden foods and by separate utensils for meat and dairy in stricter households. Prayer is another daily expression of Torah living: traditional observant Jews pray three times a day, and the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4–9) and the Amidah are central prayers that affirm God’s unity and petition, thanksgiving and praise.

Observance also shapes life-cycle events. Circumcision for infant boys (brit milah) connects families to the Abrahamic covenant. Marriage ceremonies, mourning practices and rites of passage are governed by Torah-based law and rabbinic interpretation. Ethical commandments such as justice for the stranger, care for the poor and honest business dealings show how Torah includes moral obligations that govern public life. In modern classrooms it is useful to present concrete examples: how Sabbath rules affect travel and technology use; how kosher labelling works in shops; how Shabbat and festivals structure the Jewish year.

## Worship: synagogue, prayer, ritual objects and festivals
Worship in Judaism is both communal and domestic. The synagogue is the centre of communal worship, housing the ark (Aron Kodesh) where Torah scrolls are kept, a raised platform (bimah) for public reading and often space for study. Services combine public reading of the Torah, recitation of prayers such as the Shema and the Amidah, and communal responses. The role of the rabbi is primarily interpretive and pastoral rather than sacrificial: a teacher, leader and counsellor who helps the community apply Torah to contemporary life.

Ritual objects have important symbolic meaning. The Torah scroll is read from a pointer (yad) and is dressed in a mantle. Worshippers may wear a tallit (prayer shawl) and men in Orthodox communities wear tefillin (phylacteries) during weekday morning prayers as a physical reminder of God’s commandments. Festivals provide the rhythm of worship through the year. Passover (Pesach) commemorates the Exodus and the covenantal liberation motif; Sukkot recalls God’s sheltering presence and the harvest; Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur focus on divine kingship, judgement and repentance; and Shavuot commemorates revelation at Sinai. Each festival includes specific liturgy, rituals and Torah readings that renew covenantal memory.

It is also important to explain the historical shift from the Temple cult—sacrifices centred on the Jerusalem Temple—to rabbinic worship. After 70 CE Judaism adapted: prayer, Torah study and acts of loving-kindness replaced sacrifice as primary modes of worship. This historical point explains why synagogue life and textual study became dominant forms of worship across Jewish communities.

## Diversity: denominations, modernity and interpretation
Judaism is not monolithic. Differences between Orthodox, Conservative (Masorti), Reform and Liberal movements affect how covenant, Torah and worship are understood and practised. Orthodox Jews generally maintain that the Torah—both Written and Oral—was divinely given and is binding in halakhah; worship is traditional, often gender-segregated, and ritual observance is strict. Conservative Judaism holds to the divine inspiration of Torah while allowing historical and scholarly methods to inform interpretation; practices may be traditional but can adapt. Reform and Liberal movements place greater emphasis on ethical commandments and individual autonomy, often reinterpreting ritual laws and permitting mixed seating in synagogues, more flexible observance of dietary laws and different approaches to gender roles and leadership. These differences are instructive for exam answers that must recognise variety within the Jewish tradition rather than presenting a single “Jewish” position.

Modern challenges—secularism, the State of Israel, intermarriage, gender equality and scientific questions—also shape how Jews live covenantal life and regard Torah authority. Teachers should help students see how historical circumstance (for example the destruction of the Temple or emancipation in Europe) led to new religious emphases, and how contemporary Jews negotiate ancient commitments in modern contexts.

## Key texts and sources to remember
For National 5 it is important to be familiar with core texts and where they fit. The Written Torah (Pentateuch) contains the narratives of Abraham, the Exodus and Sinai law. The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4–9) is the central declaration of monotheism used in worship and daily life. The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20 / Deuteronomy 5) are central examples of covenant law. The wider scriptures (Tanakh: Torah, Nevi’im, Ketuvim) provide history and prophecy, and rabbinic literature (Mishnah, Talmud) supplies interpretation and practical application. When answering questions, use these sources to illustrate how beliefs are grounded and how practices develop from texts.

## Exam technique
When answering SQA National 5 questions on Judaism, read the question carefully and target the command word. For knowledge questions begin with a clear definition or description: for example, define “covenant” and then give the biblical example of the Sinai covenant and its practical consequences such as the giving of the Torah. For analysis questions explain connections and consequences: link a belief (God’s covenant) to a practice (Passover Seder) and explain why the practice matters to adherents. For evaluation questions present strengths and weaknesses or contrasting viewpoints and make a supported judgement. Use evidence: name specific texts (Shema, Ten Commandments, Exodus) and practices (brit milah, Shabbat, Torah reading) to show precise knowledge. Where appropriate, show awareness of diversity by explaining how different Jewish movements might respond differently.

Structure longer answers with short paragraphs that each make a clear point. Start by stating the point, follow with explanation and an example, and end with a mini-conclusion that links back to the question. Use comparative language for evaluation: “One reason this is significant is… However, critics argue…” and finish with a balanced verdict: “Overall, while X is important because…, Y limits its application because…”

In the exam paper you will answer from the Judaism part of the World Religion section alongside questions from Morality and Belief and Religious and Philosophical Questions. Manage time so you can complete one question from each section; for the World Religion part plan to spend sufficient time on analysis and evaluation since higher marks are awarded for developed responses. For the assignment remember to choose a clear, focused issue that allows religious and non-religious viewpoints to be compared, include a Resource Sheet of no more than 200 words, and ensure you state the issue clearly on your submission. Practice past paper questions, plan answers using the ‘point–explain–example–link’ method, and rehearse writing evaluations that weigh evidence, consider counterarguments and reach a reasoned conclusion.
