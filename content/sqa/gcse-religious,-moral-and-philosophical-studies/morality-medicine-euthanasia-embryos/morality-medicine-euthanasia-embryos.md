# Morality, Medicine and the Human Body: euthanasia and embryos (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why these issues matter
Euthanasia and the use of embryos raise some of the most personal and sensitive questions people face about life, death and medical progress. These topics link ideas about human dignity, suffering, scientific possibility and legal responsibility. Students studying Morality, Medicine and the Human Body will meet the key terms, the range of moral arguments and the different religious and non-religious responses so they can explain, analyse and evaluate viewpoints. Understanding the difference between practical options, such as palliative care or research with embryos, and the moral principles people invoke—sanctity of life, personal autonomy, compassion and the prevention of harm—helps to make reasoned judgements in essays and the assignment.

## Euthanasia and assisted dying: definitions and types
Clear definitions are essential. Euthanasia normally means intentionally ending a person’s life to relieve suffering. Assisted dying or assisted suicide refers to providing someone with the means to end their own life, usually because they are terminally ill. Within these there are distinctions that matter for moral and legal discussion. Voluntary euthanasia is carried out with the informed consent of the person who dies. Non‑voluntary euthanasia occurs when the person cannot give consent (for example, if they are in a coma). Involuntary euthanasia would be ending someone’s life against their wishes and is widely condemned. Palliative care aims to relieve suffering without intentionally shortening life; hospice care focuses on comfort, dignity and support for patients and families. In law, countries differ: in the United Kingdom euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal, though high‑profile legal cases and campaigns keep the debate current, while some countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland, have laws allowing certain forms of assisted dying under strict conditions.

## Moral arguments in favour of and against euthanasia
Arguments for euthanasia often centre on autonomy and compassion. Supporters argue that competent adults should have the right to decide when and how to die if they face unbearable, incurable suffering, and that helping them is an act of mercy. Utilitarian reasoning can support this by emphasising the reduction of suffering and the promotion of well‑being for the individual and sometimes for family members. There are also pragmatic arguments: legal regulation could protect vulnerable people and provide clear safeguards instead of forcing people into secretive, risky actions.

Arguments against euthanasia commonly appeal to the sanctity or intrinsic value of human life and to duties not to kill. Critics worry about the slippery slope: once some forms are allowed, others could follow, increasing pressure on the elderly, disabled or poor to choose death. Deontological ethics stresses that intentionally killing is wrong regardless of consequences. There are also practical worries about mistakes in diagnosis, the possibility of treatable depression being misdiagnosed as terminal despair, and the risk of abuse, coercion or diminished trust in medical professionals. Many opponents point to the success of palliative care, arguing that relief from pain and emotional support can reduce the desire for euthanasia.

## Religious responses to euthanasia
Religious traditions offer a range of responses, often shaped by beliefs about the beginning and end of human life and about moral duties. In many Christian traditions, life is regarded as a sacred gift from God; therefore intentionally ending it is usually seen as morally wrong. The Roman Catholic Church strongly opposes euthanasia, arguing that life must be protected from conception to natural death and that suffering has a possible redemptive or meaningful place. Some Protestant Christians, while often cautious about euthanasia, may place greater emphasis on personal conscience and pastoral care, leading to more nuance in individual cases.

Judaism generally prioritises saving life (pikuach nefesh) and tends to reject euthanasia, though Jewish law can allow withdrawal of extraordinary means of life support in certain circumstances. Islamic responses depend on schools of thought, but many Muslim scholars oppose euthanasia because life is entrusted by God; some discussions allow withdrawal of futile treatment. Non‑religious perspectives vary widely: secular humanists and some liberal ethicists often support a strong role for autonomy, while others endorse protectionist positions for vulnerable groups. Buddhism and Hinduism, with their focus on karma and the sanctity of life in different ways, often discourage intentionally ending life, but practical responses can vary by culture and interpretation.

## Embryos: reproductive, research and therapeutic uses
Embryos are central to debates about assisted reproduction and medical research. Reproductive uses include in vitro fertilisation (IVF), where eggs are fertilised outside the body and embryos implanted to achieve pregnancy. Research uses involve studying embryos or deriving embryonic stem cells, which are pluripotent and have the potential to develop into many different cell types; this research aims to understand development and to create therapies for diseases such as Parkinson’s, diabetes or spinal cord injuries. Therapeutic cloning, or somatic cell nuclear transfer, is proposed as a route to patient‑matched stem cells. Ethical issues include the moral status of embryos, consent for their creation and use, whether it is acceptable to create and destroy embryos for potential future benefit, and whether alternatives such as adult stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) reduce the ethical tension.

Policy responses reflect these ethical questions. Some jurisdictions permit embryo research under regulation and time limits, often reflecting a compromise that recognises both the value of potential treatments and concerns about embryo destruction. Practical questions arise in clinics: what happens to “spare” embryos from IVF, how long embryos may be stored, and whether donors may consent to research use or to embryo adoption.

## Ethical and religious views on the use of embryos
Different moral frameworks lead to different conclusions about embryos. Those who argue that human life begins at conception usually oppose destruction of embryos for research, equating it with taking human life. The idea of potentiality—that an embryo has the potential to develop into a person—is central here. Deontological ethics often supports protecting embryos irrespective of potential medical benefits.

Other views treat early embryos as having a different moral status from newborn or adult persons. Some argue that embryos lack the characteristics of a person—consciousness, self‑awareness and relationships—so their moral status is lower, permitting research that may save or improve the lives of many. A utilitarian approach evaluates embryo research by weighing likely benefits against the moral costs; if research promises large numbers of lives improved or saved, the balance may favour permitting it under strict rules.

Religions vary. The Roman Catholic Church opposes creating or destroying embryos for research. Some Protestant denominations allow carefully regulated research, especially when aimed at therapeutic ends and when alternatives are not available. Jewish thought tends to give early embryos lower moral status than fully born persons, with many Jewish authorities permitting research that may save lives. Islamic jurisprudence includes differing opinions, with some scholars focusing on the timing of ensoulment when assessing permissibility; others emphasise public good and medical necessity. Hindu and Buddhist perspectives emphasise respect for life and often raise concerns, but interpretations vary widely across cultures and schools within these traditions.

## Balancing care, law and scientific progress
Practical decisions require careful balancing. In clinical contexts, the priority is often to care for the patient, provide clear information, respect advance directives and involve families sensitively. Legal systems aim to protect vulnerable people, set boundaries for medical practice and provide clear regulation for research. Regulators and professional bodies develop guidelines for consent, maximum storage times and acceptable research practices, while ethics committees ensure oversight.

Scientific developments also change the landscape. The development of induced pluripotent stem cells, which reprogramme adult cells to a stem‑like state, reduces the need to use embryos for some research and weakens one argument for embryo use; however, some therapies may still rely on embryonic sources. Debates about euthanasia are also affected by better palliative care, psychological support and the availability of assisted dying laws in other countries, which provide case studies of safeguards and pitfalls.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on euthanasia and embryos, begin by stating clear definitions to show knowledge and understanding. Use precise terms such as voluntary euthanasia, assisted dying, palliative care, embryonic stem cells and therapeutic cloning. In explanation questions, give straightforward factual detail and show how concepts connect; for example, explain why palliative care differs ethically from euthanasia. For analysis, develop points by explaining causes, implications and connections; for instance, when discussing the sanctity of life view, show how it informs opposition to both euthanasia and embryo destruction and what consequences follow for law and healthcare. In evaluation, balance strengths and weaknesses: give reasons for and against a view, weigh evidence, and reach a supported judgement. Use religious and non‑religious perspectives in answers where required, showing how a belief leads to a practical response. Refer to real‑world examples or landmark legal cases and to differences in international law to add depth, but focus on relevance to the question. In timed assessments, plan your answer with a short introduction, two or three developed paragraphs analysing and evaluating, and a concise conclusion stating your reasoned position. For the assignment, choose an issue that allows clear religious and secular viewpoints, use more than two reliable sources, state your issue clearly at the start, prepare a short resource sheet, and ensure your final evidence is your own work. Always link back to the question, use appropriate terminology, and where possible consider consequences for the individual, community and wider society to achieve strong marks.
