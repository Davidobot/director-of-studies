# Sikhism: Gurus, Guru Granth Sahib and sewa (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: the Gurus and the formation of Sikhism
Sikhism begins with Guru Nanak (1469–1539) and the line of ten human Gurus who guided the early community. Each Guru contributed to shaping Sikh belief, practice and institutions. The Gurus taught the oneness of God, the equality of all people, the importance of honest work, and the need to reject social divisions such as caste. Over about two centuries the Sikh community grew, developed a distinctive scripture and language for worship, and established the institutions of the gurdwara (place of worship), langar (community kitchen) and sangat (congregation). The lives and teachings of the Gurus are central because they explain how Sikhs should live: in devotion to God, in service to others, and in a shared, disciplined community life.

## From living Gurus to the Guru Granth Sahib: historical turning point
The last of the ten human Gurus was Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708). He responded to political and religious pressures of his time by transforming Sikh identity. In 1699 he founded the Khalsa, a community of initiated Sikhs marked by the five Ks and a strong commitment to justice and discipline. In 1708 he made a decisive change to authority within Sikhism: he declared that after him there would be no more human Gurus and gave the Guruship permanently to the sacred scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib. This meant that the living guidance of the community would now come from the text of the Gurus’ revealed hymns (shabads), read and interpreted in the presence of the congregation. Understanding this moment helps explain why the Guru Granth Sahib is treated as the living Guru and why the teachings of the human Gurus remain authoritative through that scripture.

## The Guru Granth Sahib: composition, status and use
The Guru Granth Sahib began as the Adi Granth compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. It brought together hymns by Sikh Gurus and by a number of Hindu and Muslim devotional poets (bhagats) whose words resonated with Sikh teachings. The text is written in Gurmukhi script and is primarily a collection of devotional poetry set to musical measures (ragas). When Guru Gobind Singh installed the Guru Granth Sahib as the eternal Guru, he affirmed that the divine guidance contained in its verses would lead Sikhs to spiritual union with God. In practice this means the Guru Granth Sahib is central at worship, life-cycle ceremonies and moral instruction. Protocols around the scripture reflect its status: it is placed on a raised platform, covered respectfully, and readers remove shoes and cover their heads. Services include kirtan (sung hymns), hukam (reading a passage to offer direction), and the practice of taking guidance from the shabads. The text’s multilingual and multi-traditional contents show Sikhism’s emphasis on universal devotion rather than sectarian exclusivity.

## Core teachings of the Gurus that shape sewa and daily life
The Gurus taught a clear and practical ethic. Central concepts include the oneness of God expressed by the phrase Ik Onkar, the rejection of caste and ritual purity as determinants of spiritual worth, and the ideal of living honestly through work (kirat karni) and sharing with others (vand chhakna). Sikhs are called to constant remembrance of God (simran or naam japna) while participating fully in family and social life. The Gurus cautioned against haumai, the self-centred ego, and maya, the distracting power of wealth and worldly attachment. Overcoming ego and attachment opens the way to jivan mukti, liberation while still alive, which for Sikhs is achieved by divine grace combined with disciplined spiritual practice and moral living. These teachings connect belief to action: devotion is lived out through fair work, generosity and service to others.

## Sewa: meaning, kinds and theological importance
Sewa literally means selfless service and is one of the most distinctive practices of Sikhism. It is the outward expression of inner devotion and a practical way to weaken ego. Sewa has several overlapping forms. Physical sewa includes manual work such as preparing food in the langar, cleaning the gurdwara, or providing first aid in community responses to crisis. Material sewa involves giving money, food, clothing or resources to those in need and supports community welfare. Spiritual or mental sewa takes the form of teaching, reading scripture aloud, singing kirtan, or guiding others in the faith. Together these forms show that worship in Sikhism is not confined to private prayer; it is embodied in action for the common good. Langar is the clearest example: everyone sits together to share identical food, which symbolises equality and removes social boundaries. Sewa is taught as a duty that flows from remembrance of God and a recognition that service to humanity is service to the Divine.

## How Gurus, scripture and practice connect: simran, hukam, haumai and jivan mukti
The relationship between the Gurus, the Guru Granth Sahib and lived practice is best understood through key Sikh terms. Simran (remembrance of God) is the inner discipline that keeps the heart fixed on the divine name; it is practised alongside sewa so that service is purposeful, not merely charitable habit. Hukam refers to divine command or order, often encountered in the practice of opening the Guru Granth Sahib at random and accepting the passage read as guidance for the moment. Haumai and maya are the inner obstacles the Gurus named; overcoming them requires both inward work (discipline, meditation) and outward work (ethical living and sewa). When a Sikh lives according to hukam, with simran and sewa, they move toward jivan mukti, the Sikh ideal of spiritual freedom while living. Thus theology and ritual, private devotion and public service, are all woven together in Sikh practice.

## Worship, the Khalsa and the living authority of the Guru Granth Sahib
Worship in a gurdwara centres on the Guru Granth Sahib and the community. Services begin with the scripture being treated as the living Guru: it is carried in procession, placed under a palki (canopy), and read or sung to the congregation. The Khalsa tradition, founded by Guru Gobind Singh, emphasises a disciplined, martial readiness to defend justice alongside spiritual devotion. The five Ks given to initiated Sikhs mark an outward identity and a commitment to the Guru’s ethical demands. While the human Gurus are no longer living, their authority survives through the Guru Granth Sahib and through the example of the Khalsa. In everyday life Sikhs balance loyalty to the scripture’s teachings with participation in the community’s institutions. Interpretations of the Guru Granth Sahib can vary, but the community practice of kirtan, hukam and collective sewa ensures that scripture is always read in a living context.

## Teaching and exam-ready ways to approach this topic
When revising this topic, connect facts with examples and practice writing short, focused paragraphs. Begin by being able to describe clearly who the Gurus were, what the Guru Granth Sahib is and what sewa involves. Use specific examples: Guru Arjan’s compilation of the Adi Granth in 1604; Guru Gobind Singh’s declaration in 1708 that the scripture would be the eternal Guru; the daily practice of langar in a gurdwara. For analysis aim to explain links: for example, show how sewa weakens haumai and test how simran supports ethical action. For evaluation consider questions that examiners like: does the Guru Granth Sahib provide sufficient guidance without living human Gurus? Or, is sewa the best way to achieve spiritual growth? When evaluating, weigh strengths and weaknesses, refer to Sikh teachings and to how Sikhs live out those teachings today, and end with a reasoned conclusion. Practice writing a short plan before you start an answer, use key Sikh terms accurately, and illustrate points with concrete practices and historical events.

## Exam technique
Answering SQA-style questions needs clear structure: show knowledge, then analyse, then evaluate where required. For shorter questions focus on precise definitions and an example. For a 4–6 mark question describe or explain a belief or practice in two or three linked sentences using a specific illustration, such as describing langar and explaining how it expresses equality. For longer questions allocate time so you can include explanation, analysis and evaluation. Begin with a clear opening paragraph that defines terms and states the point you will make. In the middle paragraphs develop that point with reasons, examples (for instance, reference to Guru Nanak’s teachings, Guru Arjan’s role, or the Khalsa), and show connections between beliefs and practice. Use the language of the syllabus in your answer: words like “significance”, “impact”, “relevance”, “analyse” and “evaluate” signal you should move from description to interpretation. When asked to evaluate, balance the answer by considering strengths and weaknesses and finish with a judgement that is supported by the evidence you have discussed. Practise timing: in a 2 hour 20 minute paper you will need to answer across three sections, so allow time for reading the paper, planning, writing clear paragraphs and checking your work. Finally, use key Sikh vocabulary accurately (for example Ik Onkar, simran, hukam, sewa, Khalsa, Guru Granth Sahib, jivan mukti) and show you can explain how belief links to action in the life of Sikhs today.
