# Christianity: beliefs, practices and worship (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview of Christianity as a world religion
Christianity is one of the world's major religions and its beliefs and practices shape the lives of millions. At National 5 level we focus on core Christian doctrines and how those beliefs influence the behaviour, worship and moral choices of Christians. Christianity is diverse: it includes denominations such as Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and the many Protestant churches. Despite differences in organisation and emphasis, most Christians share central convictions about God, the person and work of Jesus, human nature, sin, salvation, and the meaning of worship. A clear grasp of the vocabulary — incarnation, atonement, resurrection, sacrament, liturgy — helps you explain and analyse how doctrine links to daily life and communal worship. Throughout your revision, try to connect doctrinal points with practical examples: scripture passages, types of worship, and contemporary Christian responses to moral issues.

## The nature of God
Christians believe in one God who is personal, loving and just. God is often described using the attributes ‘omnipotent’ (all-powerful), ‘omniscient’ (all-knowing) and ‘omnibenevolent’ (all-loving). Another central Christian way of understanding God is the doctrine of the Trinity: Father, Son and Holy Spirit — three persons in one divine being. This is a distinctive feature of mainstream Christianity and explains how God can be both transcendent (beyond and above creation) and immanent (present and active within creation). Beliefs about God shape worship (praise, prayer and adoration), moral expectations (love of neighbour, justice) and hope (trust in God’s purposes). Different Christians emphasise different attributes; for example, some may focus on God’s justice in response to suffering while others highlight God’s mercy and forgiveness.

## Human nature, free will and sin
Christian teaching often begins with the idea that humans are created in God’s likeness, given dignity and worth. This belief underpins Christian support for human rights and care for the vulnerable. At the same time Christianity recognises human freedom: free will means individuals can choose good or evil. The concept of sin explains why people sometimes choose selfish or harmful actions. Traditions differ in how they understand sin: many Western churches accept the idea of original sin as an inherited tendency toward wrongdoing, while other Christians stress personal responsibility for moral choices. The doctrine of sin connects directly with ethics: if humans are morally responsible, rules, conscience and community all matter in guiding action. Christians also discuss forgiveness, repentance and moral transformation as responses to sin, emphasising that remorse and a change of heart are central to being restored in relationship with God and others.

## Jesus Christ: incarnation, death and resurrection
Jesus is the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe he is the incarnation of God — God become human — which explains why his life and teachings have unique religious authority. The incarnation links divine purposes with human experience: in Jesus God lives, teaches and suffers among people. The death of Jesus is interpreted in different but related ways: many Christians speak of atonement, the idea that Jesus’ suffering and death restore the broken relationship between humans and God. The resurrection is the decisive event in Christian faith: Jesus’ rising from death is understood as triumph over sin and death, promising new life to believers. These beliefs are not abstract; they inform worship (Easter is the most important festival), shape ethics (self-giving love modeled by Jesus) and inspire practical service. Denominational traditions emphasise different aspects of Jesus’ work: some focus on sacrificial atonement, others on moral example or on liberation and solidarity with the poor.

## Salvation, judgement, heaven and hell
Christian ideas about salvation explain how people are saved or brought into right relationship with God. Salvation may be described as God’s gift received by faith, as a process of becoming holy, or as liberation from the powers of evil. Christians also believe in a final judgement when God will evaluate human lives. Traditional imagery of heaven and hell speaks to ultimate reward and punishment, but contemporary Christians interpret these ideas in various ways: some hold to literal understandings, others offer symbolic or metaphorical readings, and some emphasise God’s mercy and hope for reconciliation. These beliefs affect Christian attitudes to ethics and social action: the expectation of divine judgement can motivate moral responsibility, while hope in salvation can encourage compassionate care for others. Understanding the range of views will help you evaluate how doctrine influences behaviour and how Christians respond to questions about justice, suffering and the afterlife.

## Following Jesus: teachings, example and Christian living
Christian ethics flows from Jesus’ teachings and example. The highest moral commandment for many Christians is love — love of God and love of neighbour — expressed in the Sermon on the Mount and in parables such as the Good Samaritan. Christians are called to live out virtues such as humility, forgiveness, justice and service. The idea of discipleship means actively following Jesus: prayer, reading scripture, worship and acts of charity are practical expressions of that commitment. Church life supports moral formation: community, religious instruction and sacraments help shape identity and behaviour. Christians also engage with public issues — poverty, human rights, environment — drawing on theological principles to offer moral responses. When you discuss Christian living in an exam, link belief to practice: explain how a doctrine such as ‘humans made in God’s image’ leads to concrete actions, for instance campaigning for social justice or providing pastoral care.

## Worship and sacramental life
Worship is central to Christian identity. It includes communal services, prayer, scripture reading and sacraments. Worship styles vary widely: liturgical churches follow set forms and a church calendar with seasons like Advent and Lent, while non-liturgical or charismatic churches favour spontaneous prayer, contemporary music and personal testimony. Sacraments are visible signs of inward grace; most Christians accept baptism and the Eucharist (Holy Communion) as central. Baptism marks initiation into the Christian community and may be administered to infants or adults depending on the tradition. The Eucharist commemorates Jesus’ Last Supper and is understood variously as a memorial, a real presence of Christ, or a symbolic act of thanksgiving. Private devotion — personal prayer, reading the Bible, and acts of service — complements public worship. The role of the church as a community and place of worship has both personal and social consequences: it fosters identity, offers moral support, and organises outreach, such as food banks or international relief.

## Denominations and diversity in belief and practice
Christianity’s global reach produces a rich diversity of beliefs and practices. Roman Catholicism emphasises the authority of the Church and sacraments, Eastern Orthodoxy preserves ancient liturgy and sacramental theology, and Protestant traditions often stress scripture’s authority and individual faith. Within Protestantism there are wide differences: Anglican worship can be highly liturgical, Baptist churches practice believer’s baptism and independent governance, and Pentecostal movements highlight charismatic gifts and expressive worship. These differences matter in exam answers: showing awareness that Christians do not all agree strengthens analysis and evaluation. For example, when discussing the nature of baptism or the meaning of the Eucharist, explain how different traditions interpret the same practice and the consequences of those interpretations for community life and personal faith.

## Exam technique
Answering questions well requires clear structure, precise knowledge and thoughtful evaluation. Start by reading the question carefully and make sure you mirror its wording in your answer so you address exactly what is asked. For short knowledge questions aim to give clear factual statements with brief explanation; for analysis questions explain connections, causes or consequences rather than listing facts. For evaluation questions offer a balanced judgement: identify strengths and weaknesses of arguments, consider different Christian responses, and then present a supported conclusion. Always use religious vocabulary accurately — terms like incarnation, atonement, sacrament and liturgy show understanding — and support points with concrete examples, such as a Bible teaching, a denomination’s practice or a contemporary Christian charity. When answering longer questions, use a short introduction that outlines your approach, develop two or three main paragraphs each focused on one idea with evidence and analysis, and finish with a conclusion that directly answers the question.

If you are preparing an assignment, choose an issue that allows comparison of religious and non-religious viewpoints and state the issue clearly at the start — failure to state it can lose marks. Use the research stage to gather several credible sources and prepare a concise Resource Sheet (up to 200 words) that outlines your plan and key evidence; this will be the only support allowed during the one-hour write-up. During the production stage write a clearly organised report: define the issue, present factual knowledge, analyse different responses (including at least one religious viewpoint), evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and end with a reasoned conclusion. In both exams and assignments aim for clarity, balance and precision: accurate knowledge scores marks, analysis shows understanding, and well-supported evaluation demonstrates higher-level thinking.
