# Morality and Relationships: sex, marriage and equality (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why this topic matters
Relationships, sex and marriage are central to most people’s lives and to the ways societies organise themselves. Questions about who we may marry, what counts as a healthy sexual relationship, the purpose of sex, the roles of men and women, and how equality should be promoted or enforced are both personal and public. This topic asks you to consider facts and laws alongside moral principles, religious teachings and non-religious ethical approaches. In National 5 RMPS you are expected to describe beliefs and practices, analyse their causes and consequences, and evaluate different positions. That means knowing what people believe, understanding why they believe it, and being able to judge strengths and weaknesses in different responses.

## Gender roles and changing expectations
Gender roles refer to the social expectations attached to being male, female or another gender. Traditionally many societies assigned clear roles: men as providers and women as carers. Religious traditions have shaped and reinforced these roles in different ways. For example, some interpretations of Christianity and Islam historically placed emphasis on complementary roles within the family, while Hindu teachings about dharma assigned duties according to stage of life and social position. Sikhism and many modern interpretations of Buddhism stress equality and the importance of treating all people with respect, regardless of gender.

In contemporary Britain gender roles are changing. Increasing numbers of women work outside the home, fathers take a larger share of childcare, and laws prohibit discrimination on grounds of sex and gender. These social changes raise moral questions that you should be able to explore: should gender roles be preserved as cultural heritage, or reformed to promote equality? What are the consequences of rigid roles for individuals’ mental health, opportunities and freedom? When analysing these questions, consider both the impact on individuals (psychological well‑being, personal freedom) and on communities (family stability, economic effects). Evaluating viewpoints will often involve balancing respect for tradition with principles of fairness and human rights.

## Sexual relationships: purpose, consent and protection
Sexual relationships are commonly discussed in terms of their purposes: procreation, expression of love and commitment, pleasure, and the strengthening of emotional bonds. Different religious and secular perspectives emphasise different purposes. Many religious traditions value sex within marriage and see procreation as an important purpose; other religious and non‑religious voices accept sex outside marriage provided it is consensual and responsible.

Consent is the central ethical and legal concept. Consent means freely agreeing to sexual activity, with the capacity to consent and without coercion, manipulation or exploitation. In the UK legal framework the age of consent and laws against sexual offences set boundaries to protect vulnerable people. From an ethical standpoint, consent respects personal autonomy and dignity; without consent, sexual activity is harmful and criminal. When you analyse exam questions, show you understand the difference between consent and mere acquiescence, and be able to apply that distinction to scenarios.

Protection is also important: contraception, sexually transmitted infection prevention, and information about safe sex are matters both of personal responsibility and public health. Many religious communities teach abstinence or restrict contraception, while secular public health approaches emphasise access to information and services. In evaluation, consider the effects of different approaches on unwanted pregnancies, health outcomes, and individual conscience.

## Same‑sex relationships and religious responses
Attitudes to same‑sex relationships vary widely. Non‑religious human rights perspectives argue that sexual orientation is a matter of personal identity and that equal treatment under the law is essential. Many secular arguments for legal recognition of same‑sex relationships focus on fairness, freedom and the wellbeing of couples and their children.

Religious responses are diverse. Some religious communities have traditionally taught that sexual relations should take place only within heterosexual marriage. Other communities and denominations have reinterpreted texts or emphasise broader principles such as love, justice and the dignity of all people, and therefore accept same‑sex relationships and marriages. In recent decades many legal systems in the UK and other countries have recognised same‑sex civil partnerships and marriages, reflecting shifts in social attitudes and interpretations of equality.

When you analyse this area, show awareness that religious teachings are not monolithic. Explain reasons for both opposition and support: opponents may appeal to scriptural authority or the belief that marriage is ordered toward procreation, while supporters may emphasise the importance of commitment, mutual care and non‑discrimination. In evaluation, weigh the importance of religious freedom against the rights of LGBTQ+ people to equal treatment, and consider practical consequences for families and communities.

## Marriage: types, purposes and cultural variations
Marriage can be understood legally, socially and religiously. Common purposes ascribed to marriage include companionship, the establishment of a stable environment for raising children, mutual support, sexual fidelity and the formation of a recognised partnership. Religions frame marriage in different ways: Christianity often speaks of marriage as a covenant and a reflection of God’s relationship with humanity; Hindu traditions treat marriage as a sacrament and a key duty (dharma) in adult life; in Islam marriage is a lawful and social contract; Sikhism values marriage as a partnership based on equality and mutual respect.

There are different forms of marriage and relationship arrangements in the modern world. Arranged marriages, where families play a central role in choosing partners, remain common in some cultures; they are not the same as forced marriages, in which a person is compelled to marry against their will. Cohabitation — couples living together without legal marriage — has become more widespread and raises moral and legal questions about rights, responsibility and social recognition. Same‑sex marriages and civil partnerships are now legal in many parts of the UK and other countries, reflecting changing moral norms and legal equality. When answering exam questions, make sure you explain the differences between types of marriage and the ethical issues each raises, for instance the role of consent in arranged marriages and the social protections marriage affords.

## Divorce and changing attitudes
Divorce raises moral questions about commitment, responsibility and compassion. Religious traditions vary in their approach to divorce: some churches and communities allow divorce under certain conditions and offer pastoral care, while others regard marriage as indissoluble or place strict limits on remarriage. Secular approaches tend to focus on practical questions of rights, welfare and the best interests of any children involved.

Social changes have made divorce more common and socially acceptable in many places. Analysing divorce requires attention to causes — such as breakdown of communication, abuse, financial stress — and consequences for adults and children. Evaluation should balance respect for the ideal of lifelong commitment with an understanding that staying in a harmful relationship can be damaging. Consider the ethical duty to protect vulnerable people and promote flourishing, and how this informs differing religious and non‑religious responses.

## Equality, exploitation and the role of the media
Equality in relationships means that people have equal worth, opportunities and legal protections regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race or background. Many religious traditions include principles that support dignity and fairness, even when their social teachings about roles or marriage differ. Non‑religious ethical frameworks, such as human rights or utilitarianism, also provide strong arguments for equality.

Exploitation occurs when power is abused in relationships — for example, through sexual coercion, trafficking, grooming, or economic dependence. Religious and secular moral frameworks converge in condemning exploitation, though they may frame the problem differently. The media plays a powerful role in shaping attitudes: it can perpetuate stereotypes and objectification that normalise inequality, or it can challenge prejudice and promote positive narratives about consent, respect and diverse family forms. When you evaluate media influence, consider both short‑term effects on behaviours and long‑term cultural shifts.

## Applying religious and non‑religious ethics to issues in this topic
To answer exam questions well you should be able to apply religious teachings and non‑religious ethical theories to specific moral issues. For example, use Christian ideas about love and the sanctity of marriage or Islamic teachings on family responsibility when discussing marriage; use human rights language and utilitarian reasoning when arguing for legal equality for same‑sex couples; and draw on Buddhist teachings about intention and harm when analysing sexual consent and exploitation. Always explain how a teaching or theory leads to a particular conclusion and consider counterarguments. For instance, when a religious rule appears to limit equality, explain why some believers defend that rule (appeal to tradition, sacred texts, perceived social goods) and how critics respond (appeal to human rights, reinterpretation of texts, harm‑based reasoning).

When analysing and evaluating, move beyond description. Show the implications of a position, predict consequences, and measure strengths and weaknesses. Use examples and case studies: a law protecting coercion victims, a public health programme promoting safe sex, or a local community negotiating religious freedom and equality. Real examples make answers concrete and show understanding of how beliefs translate into practice.

## Exam technique
In the exam you will be asked to describe, analyse and evaluate. For description aim for clear, accurate facts and definitions: explain what a term means and give an example. For analysis, make connections and explain causes and consequences; ask “why?” and “how?” and show relationships between beliefs, practices and effects. For evaluation make balanced judgements: identify strengths and weaknesses of positions, weigh evidence, and reach a reasoned conclusion.

Structure long answers with a clear opening sentence that addresses the question, followed by paragraphs that develop points with evidence and examples, and finish with a concluding paragraph that answers the question directly. When asked to use religious and non‑religious responses, include at least one clear example of each and explain how they differ. Use switch phrases to signal your skills: phrases such as “one reason for this is…”, “this implies that…”, “a possible objection is…”, and “in conclusion I would argue…” help the examiner see you are describing, analysing or evaluating.

Manage your time by dividing it according to marks: spend longer on higher‑mark questions and keep an eye on the clock. Read questions carefully, underline command words (describe, explain, analyse, evaluate), and make sure you answer exactly what is asked. Finally, use precise religious terms where appropriate, explain sources of belief, and bring in contemporary examples to show relevance. Clear, well‑supported answers that show balanced thinking will gain the best marks.
