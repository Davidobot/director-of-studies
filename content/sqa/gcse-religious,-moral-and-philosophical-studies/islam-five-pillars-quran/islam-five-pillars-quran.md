# Islam: Five Pillars, Qur'an and daily practice (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview of Islam and key beliefs
Islam is a monotheistic religion whose name means “submission” to the will of God (Allah). Central to Islam is the belief that there is one God who is compassionate and merciful, and that human beings are created to worship God and to act as God’s stewards on earth (khalifah). Muslims accept the Qur'an as God’s final revelation and Muhammad as the last prophet (the Seal of the Prophets). Other important beliefs include the existence of angels, divine revelation, accountability on the Day of Judgement, and life after death in Paradise (al-Jannah) or Hell (Jahannam). These beliefs shape how Muslims understand purpose, morality and community, and they give a framework that links faith with everyday decisions and public life.

## The Qur'an: revelation, authority and use
The Qur'an is the central religious scripture in Islam and is regarded by Muslims as the literal word of God revealed to Muhammad through the angel Jibril over about twenty-three years. It is written in Arabic and traditionally memorised, recited and studied in that language; many non-Arabic speakers learn the Arabic text for worship while using translations to understand meaning. The Qur'an functions as guidance for belief, moral teaching and practical life. It addresses worship, law, personal conduct and social relations, and it is used in ritual contexts such as prayer and public readings. In addition to the Qur'an, the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad—the Hadith—help explain how Qur'anic teachings apply in everyday situations. In many Muslim communities the Qur'an is central to education and family life: children learn to recite it, adults consult it for guidance, and scholars refer to it when interpreting religious law. The authority of the Qur'an is not only theological but also cultural and legal in places where Shariah influences civil code.

## Muhammad and the role of prophetic example
Muhammad is seen by Muslims as the final prophet who received the Qur'an and modelled how to live according to God’s guidance. His character and conduct (the Sunnah) provide a practical example for worship, family life, business, dispute resolution and community leadership. The idea that Muhammad is a role model does not mean Muslims worship him; rather, they respect and emulate his behaviour when seeking to apply Qur'anic principles. The Hadith collections record many episodes of Muhammad’s life—how he treated neighbours, how he prayed, how he handled hardship—and these stories are an important source when Muslims consider how to behave in new or complex situations. Understanding Muhammad’s life helps explain ritual details, ethical priorities, and the balance Islam seeks between private devotion and social responsibility.

## The Five Pillars explained
The Five Pillars are the core practices that structure Muslim religious life. They provide a clear framework for how faith is expressed in worship and community obligations, and each pillar carries theological and social significance.

The Shahadah is the declaration of faith: “There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Messenger of God.” Saying the Shahadah with conviction marks someone as a Muslim and summarises the central beliefs of monotheism and prophethood.

Salah (ritual prayer) is performed five times a day at set times. These prayers involve physical actions—standing, bowing, prostrating—and recitation of Qur'anic verses. Before prayer, Muslims perform wudu (ritual washing) to be physically and spiritually prepared. Prayer is a direct link between the worshipper and God; it disciplines the day, expresses submission, and builds communal bonds when performed together, especially at Friday midday congregational prayer (Jumu'ah).

Zakat is an obligatory form of almsgiving intended to redistribute wealth and support those in need. It is a duty to give a portion of one’s accumulated wealth annually if it exceeds a threshold (the nisab). Zakat supports the poor, orphans, travellers and others defined by Islamic law. Beyond meeting material needs, zakat emphasises social justice, responsibility and the moral obligation to reduce inequality.

Sawm, the fast of Ramadan, requires abstaining from food, drink and other physical needs from dawn to sunset during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Ramadan is a time for increased prayer, Qur'anic reading and reflection on self-discipline. Fasting cultivates empathy with the poor, self-control and spiritual renewal. Exceptions are made for those who are ill, pregnant, elderly or travelling, and those unable to fast may make up the days or provide food for the needy.

Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca required at least once in a lifetime for those who are physically and financially able. Hajj rituals include entering the state of ritual consecration (ihram), circumambulating the Kaaba (tawaf), walking between the hills of Safa and Marwah (sa'i), standing at the Plain of Arafat, and symbolic acts such as the ritual stoning at Mina. Hajj unites Muslims worldwide, expresses equality before God, and recalls Abrahamic themes of trust in God and communal sacrifice.

Each pillar is both a personal act of devotion and a public statement: together they shape identity, social order and a rhythm to life.

## Daily practice and communal worship
Daily practice in Islam blends private devotion with communal life. The five daily prayers mark the rhythm of a Muslim’s day; the early morning (Fajr), midday (Dhuhr), mid-afternoon (Asr), sunset (Maghrib) and evening (Isha) prayers create regular moments of reflection and submission. Many mosques call the faithful to prayer, provide a space for community worship and act as centres for education and social services. Cleanliness is emphasised in everyday life: ritual washing before prayer, modest dress, and dietary laws such as abstaining from pork and alcohol are practical ways belief informs behaviour. In family life, the Qur'an and prophetic teachings influence marriage practices, child-rearing and ethical decisions. Festivals give communal shape to worship: Eid al-Fitr celebrates the end of Ramadan with prayer, charity and shared meals, while Eid al-Adha commemorates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice and highlights obedience, sacrifice and provision for the poor. These practices reinforce identity, provide mutual support and give visible signs of religious commitment in public life.

## Living according to the Qur'an: ethics, law and identity
To “live according to the Qur'an” means applying its ethical teachings and guidance to concrete choices. The Qur'an stresses justice, compassion, honesty, care for the vulnerable and responsibility toward creation. These general principles are applied through rules, moral teachings and community standards. In many Muslim-majority societies the Qur'an and Hadith inform family law, inheritance, and aspects of criminal law, while in other contexts Muslims use the Qur'an as personal and moral guidance within a secular legal framework. The concept of stewardship (khalifah) encourages careful use of the environment and resources, while teachings about accountability and the Day of Judgement provide moral motivation. Issues such as medical ethics, business honesty, treatment of minorities and gender roles are areas where Muslims interpret and apply Qur'anic guidance in varied ways. Differences in interpretation—between schools of jurisprudence, cultural practices, and between Sunni and Shia communities—mean that “living according to the Qur'an” looks different across the world. For many Muslims, the Qur'an shapes moral identity and daily choices; for communities it provides cohesion and a basis for social action, such as zakat-funded projects or charity work that address poverty and education.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Islam for National 5 RMPS, make sure your responses show clear knowledge, straight‑forward analysis and balanced evaluation. For shorter questions, give accurate factual detail: for example, define the Shahadah, list the five daily prayers and explain the purpose of zakat. For explain-type questions aim to show understanding by linking facts to meaning—for instance, explain how fasting in Ramadan develops empathy and self-discipline. For analysis, make connections between beliefs and practices: show how the idea of God’s oneness (tawhid) shapes daily prayer and community unity, or how the Qur'an and Hadith work together to guide behaviour. When asked to evaluate, present strengths and weaknesses or benefits and drawbacks, and make a supported judgement: weigh the importance of ritual practices for personal faith against the challenges of applying Qur'anic rules in diverse modern societies.

Use subject-specific vocabulary accurately—terms such as Qur'an, Hadith, Prophet Muhammad, Shahadah, Salah, Zakat, Sawm, Hajj, wudu, Jumu'ah, khalifah and terms for the afterlife—and explain these when necessary to show knowledge. Support answers with examples: describe a Hajj ritual, explain how wudu prepares a person for prayer, or give an example of zakat being used to help a local community. In longer answers, structure your response with a clear introduction, developed paragraphs that analyse and explain, and a conclusion that evaluates and gives your reasoned viewpoint. Time management is important in the 2 hour 20 minute paper: aim to allocate time based on mark value, leaving a few minutes to check your work. For the assignment, choose a clear issue that allows you to present different viewpoints including a religious one, use several sources during research, prepare a concise Resource Sheet (no more than 200 words) to use in the supervised writing stage, and ensure your final report states the issue clearly and reaches a reasoned conclusion based on evidence. Following these approaches will help you show the required knowledge, analysis and evaluation for success in the course.
