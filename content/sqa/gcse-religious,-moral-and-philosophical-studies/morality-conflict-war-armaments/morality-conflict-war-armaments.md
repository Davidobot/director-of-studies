# Morality and Conflict: war, armaments and alternatives to war (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Causes and types of conflict
Conflicts arise for many reasons and take different forms. At the simplest level, wars can begin from competition for territory, resources or power, or from deep-rooted political, ethnic or religious tensions. Economic inequality, failed states, and environmental pressures such as drought or resource scarcity may make violent confrontation more likely. Some wars are interstate, fought between recognised countries; others are civil wars within a state, where factions contest authority. There are also asymmetric conflicts, where a state fights non-state groups such as insurgents or terrorist organisations. Understanding the causes helps explain why solutions differ: a border dispute may be resolvable through negotiation, while long-standing ethnic grievances may require truth and reconciliation processes alongside legal and political measures.

Types of war include conventional wars, fought with regular armies and standard weapons; wars involving guerrilla tactics and insurgency; and total wars, which aim to mobilise entire societies and economies. In the modern era, conflict can include cyber warfare, economic coercion and proxy wars in which outside powers support local forces. Each type of conflict raises distinct moral issues, for example the difficulty of distinguishing combatants from civilians in insurgencies, or the ethics of state-sponsored cyber attacks that can harm public services and civilians.

## Justifications for war and Just War theory
People and states have offered several justifications for going to war, ranging from defence against aggression to humanitarian intervention. The most familiar moral framework that attempts to justify armed force is Just War theory, rooted in classical and Christian thought and developed by thinkers such as Augustine and Aquinas. Just War sets out criteria both for entering war (jus ad bellum) and for conduct within war (jus in bello). Typical requirements for a just cause include a real and grave threat, legitimate authority to declare war, right intention (not simply gain or revenge), last resort after all peaceful means have failed, reasonable chance of success, and proportionality between harm caused and good expected. For conduct, discrimination requires combatants to distinguish between fighters and non-combatants, and proportionality forbids excessive force that causes more harm than the military advantage gained.

Religious perspectives vary. Many Christians accept Just War principles while also valuing peacemaking and forgiveness; the Roman Catholic Church, for example, still teaches the possibility of morally justified war in exceptional cases. In Islam, classical jurists distinguish between legitimate defensive warfare and aggression, emphasising rules about the treatment of prisoners and civilians; modern Muslim thinkers debate how these principles apply today. Buddhism emphasises non-harming and compassion, making most forms of violence deeply problematic, which explains why many Buddhists lean towards pacifism or strict restraints on violence. Non-religious positions also divide: utilitarians may justify war if it produces the greatest overall good, whereas human-rights-based arguments may support interventions to stop genocide even if war causes harm in the short term. Each justification raises strong criticisms, especially when applied to recent conflicts where motives have been questioned or where the aftermath worsened the situation.

## International law and the Geneva Conventions
Since the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, states have tried to limit the worst abuses of war through legal norms. The Geneva Conventions form the core of international humanitarian law, setting rules to protect wounded soldiers, shipwrecked sailors, prisoners of war and civilians. These treaties require humane treatment of captives, prohibit torture and demand that medical personnel be protected. Hague Conventions and later protocols add rules about means and methods of warfare. The laws reflect moral concerns: even in war there are limits on cruelty and deliberate targeting of civilians.

In practice, however, enforcing these rules is difficult. Non-state actors, terrorist groups and loosely organised militias may not accept or follow the conventions, and states sometimes break the rules with impunity. New technologies and tactics also stretch established law: for example, drone strikes across borders raise questions about sovereignty and civilian casualties, while cyber attacks provoke debates about whether and how international humanitarian law applies. International courts and mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court aim to hold individuals accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but political realities often limit their reach. Teaching this topic, it is helpful to stress both the moral ideals behind the conventions and the practical problems of making them work.

## Consequences of war: human, environmental and economic
The human cost of war is the most immediate moral concern. Death, injury, psychological trauma and the displacement of populations leave long-term scars. Civilians frequently bear the heaviest burden: sieges, indiscriminate bombings and attacks on infrastructure can cause more casualties than battlefield engagements. Wars also create refugee crises, placing strains on neighbouring countries and humanitarian agencies. The social fabric of communities is damaged; trust breaks down, and cycles of revenge can entrench conflict across generations.

Environmental consequences can be severe and long lasting. Warfare destroys habitats, contaminates water and soil, and can cause large-scale pollution through oil spills, scorched earth tactics, and the use of chemicals. Nuclear weapons and certain chemicals produce radiation and toxins that persist for decades. Reconciling short-term military goals with long-term environmental stewardship is morally charged: does a military objective ever justify irreversible environmental damage?

Economically, war diverts enormous resources away from health, education and development. Post-conflict reconstruction can cost many times the price of prevention, and economies may be crippled by destruction of infrastructure, loss of workforce and capital flight. Conversely, some industries profit from arms sales, creating ethical concerns about the global arms trade, its influence on policy and its impact on peace. When evaluating war’s consequences, it is important to consider disproportionate impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable.

## Modern armaments and changing warfare
The technology of war has evolved rapidly, raising fresh moral questions. Weapons of mass destruction—nuclear, chemical and biological arms—have the capacity to inflict catastrophic civilian casualties and long-term environmental harm. Nuclear weapons, in particular, underpin the strategy of deterrence, where the threat of mutual destruction is argued to prevent large-scale wars. Critics counter that the mere existence of such weapons poses an unacceptable moral risk and that accidents or proliferation could be catastrophic.

Precision-guided munitions and “smart” weapons were designed to reduce collateral damage by striking military targets more accurately, yet their use does not eliminate moral dilemmas. Remote warfare using drones and increasingly autonomous systems distances decision-makers from the battlefield, raising concerns about accountability, lowered thresholds for using force, and the psychological impact on civilian populations living under remote surveillance and attack. Autonomous lethal weapons, sometimes called “killer robots,” prompt ethical debates over whether machines should make life-and-death decisions.

Conventional weapons—tanks, artillery, aircraft—remain deadly, and their widespread availability can prolong conflicts. The global arms trade, sanctioned and regulated to varying degrees, links economic interests with security policies. Students should be able to explain how new military technologies change the moral calculus, both by offering ways to limit harm and by creating novel risks.

## Alternatives to war: sanctions, diplomacy and pacifism
Not all states or actors choose military force. Sanctions, diplomacy and pacifism are among the main alternatives, each with strengths and weaknesses. Sanctions are economic and political measures intended to pressure a state to change behaviour without direct violence. They can be targeted or comprehensive, and while they offer a non-violent tool, broad sanctions may harm ordinary citizens and be counterproductive. The international sanctions on apartheid South Africa, which combined economic pressure with internal resistance, are often cited as successful, while sanctions that isolate populations without influencing leaders are criticised.

Diplomacy remains the most classical alternative to war. Diplomatic negotiation, mediation by neutral parties, treaties and peace processes can resolve disputes or at least manage them. Multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and regional organisations provide forums for dialogue, sanctions, peacekeeping and legal action. Successful diplomacy can prevent escalation but requires political will, mutual trust and incentives for both sides to engage. Examples such as the Camp David Accords or negotiated endings to civil conflicts show how diplomacy can transform hostile relations into peaceful settlement.

Pacifism rejects war altogether on moral grounds, arguing that violence is never justified. Religious traditions supply strong pacifist voices: Quakers and many Buddhists emphasise non-violence, while some Christian denominations adopt conscientious objection to military service. There are also conditional pacifists, who oppose most war but accept non-violent resistance, civil disobedience or strictly defensive actions. Critics of pacifism argue that refusing all force can allow oppression or genocide to continue unchecked; supporters contend that violence begets violence and that non-violent strategies—when carefully planned—can achieve moral and political change without the costs of war.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on morality and conflict, be clear about the command words used: describe questions require factual detail about causes, laws or types of weapons; explain and analyse questions need reasons and consequences, linking causes to effects; evaluate questions must weigh strengths and weaknesses and reach a justified conclusion. Always give both religious and non-religious perspectives where the question asks for them: for example, present a Just War argument, then a pacifist critique, and show how each applies to a concrete case such as drone strikes or sanctions. Use specific examples to support points, naming historical or contemporary conflicts, treaties like the Geneva Conventions, and types of armaments. When evaluating, apply criteria—such as proportionality, effectiveness, justice or human rights—to judge the arguments, and avoid asserting opinions without support. Structure longer answers with a short introduction that defines the issue, a middle section that lays out arguments and evidence, and a conclusion that makes a reasoned judgement tied back to the question. For the assignment, choose an issue you can research well, include clear religious and non-religious viewpoints, and be precise about the question you are addressing; remember to attach the short resource sheet required. Finally, practise past paper questions under timed conditions and aim to balance factual knowledge with analysis and evaluation to meet the standards expected at National 5 level.
