# Morality, Environment & Global Issues: poverty, resources and climate (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: why this topic matters
This area of the course links moral thinking with urgent global realities: how we use the Earth’s resources, why many people live in poverty, and how climate change is reshaping lives and ecosystems. Questions about fairness, responsibility and human flourishing come to the fore when we consider who benefits from resources, who bears the cost of climate change, and what kinds of international responses are morally acceptable. For examination purposes you will be asked to show factual knowledge of these issues, explain religious and non‑religious responses, analyse causes and consequences, and offer an evaluated personal viewpoint. A clear understanding of basic concepts — resource management, global warming, biodiversity, trade and aid — will help you combine evidence and moral argument in answers and in the assignment.

## Key concepts: resources, climate and biodiversity
Natural resources are raw materials such as water, arable land, forests, minerals and fossil fuels that societies use to survive and to develop. Resource management describes how we control use of these resources so they are available now and in the future; sustainable management seeks a balance between human needs and the health of ecosystems. Climate change refers to long‑term shifts in temperature and weather patterns caused largely by human activity that increases greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; this leads to global warming, rising sea levels and more extreme weather events. Biodiversity means the variety of life in a particular place or on the planet; loss of biodiversity reduces ecosystem resilience and undermines services such as pollination, clean water and soil fertility. These concepts are connected: the way resources are extracted and consumed contributes to climate change and to the loss of biodiversity, while climate impacts in turn undermine resource availability and deepen poverty.

## Causes and effects of poverty in an environmental context
Poverty has many causes and the environment interacts with economic, political and historical factors to make poverty worse. Structural causes include unequal trade relationships, unfair debt burdens and the legacy of colonial exploitation that left weak institutions in many countries. Environmental causes are becoming increasingly important: climate change causes droughts, floods and storms that destroy crops, homes and income; depletion of soil fertility and freshwater scarcity reduce agricultural productivity; and over‑exploitation of forests and fisheries strips local people of food and livelihood resources. Conflict and political instability also exacerbate poverty by displacing communities and interrupting aid and development. The effects of poverty are wide ranging: malnutrition and poor health, reduced access to education and water, migration and urban slums, and intergenerational cycles in which children miss opportunities. Importantly for RMPS, poverty raises moral questions about justice, human dignity and the obligations of richer countries towards poorer ones.

## Religious and non‑religious responses: principles and practices
Religions offer ethical frameworks that shape responses to poverty and the environment. Many religious traditions promote stewardship, the idea that humans have a responsibility to care for creation. In Christianity stewardship is often framed around the belief that the world is God’s creation and that humans are caretakers; Christian charities run development projects, relief work and conservation initiatives. In Islam the concept of khalipha (stewardship) and the emphasis on justice and charity (zakat) motivate practical action to support the poor and to avoid waste. Judaism’s idea of tikkun olam, repairing the world, and Sikhism’s emphasis on sewa, selfless service, encourage community action and social justice. Eastern traditions contribute different emphases: Hindu concepts of dharma and ahimsa can foster respect for life and restraint in consumption, while Buddhist teachings on compassion and interdependence encourage mindful living and care for sentient beings. Non‑religious perspectives, including humanism and environmental ethics, argue from principles such as human rights, utilitarian calculations of greatest good, and intrinsic value attributed to nature; they support policies that reduce suffering, protect ecosystems and promote fair distribution of resources. In practice, religious groups and secular organisations often overlap in charity work, development programmes and climate campaigns, but they may differ in motivation and language: one may speak of moral duty to God, another of rights and global responsibility.

## Trade, aid and charity: forms, controversies and moral evaluation
Responses to poverty and global inequality take many forms. Trade policies can help or hinder development: fair trade initiatives aim to give producers in poorer countries a better deal by ensuring fair prices, decent working conditions and long‑term trading relationships, while critics point out that market access, subsidies in rich countries and complex supply chains can still disadvantage small producers. Aid is also varied. Humanitarian aid provides emergency relief in disasters, development aid supports long‑term projects such as education and infrastructure, and debt relief aims to free resources for domestic spending. Charities, non‑governmental organisations and multilateral institutions all play roles, but controversies persist: tied aid that obliges recipients to buy goods from donor countries can be counterproductive; short‑term projects may create dependency if not well designed; and aid can be politically manipulated. Moral evaluation should weigh the immediate relief of suffering against long‑term justice and autonomy, recognising that sustainable solutions often require political and economic change as well as charitable giving.

## Practical solutions and policies: mitigation, adaptation and sustainable management
Practical responses to climate and resource crises fall into mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through transitions to renewable energy, improved energy efficiency, reforestation and changes in agriculture and transport. Adaptation prepares societies for changes already underway by strengthening infrastructure, diversifying crops, improving water management and planning for climate‑related migration. Resource management includes sustainable agriculture, conservation of biodiversity through protected areas and restoration projects, circular economy approaches that reduce waste, and policy tools such as carbon pricing or regulation. Ethical choices arise in how these measures are distributed: who pays for mitigation, who suffers from conservation restrictions, and how to balance development needs against environmental protection. International agreements such as the Paris Agreement aim to share responsibility, and mechanisms like climate finance are intended to support poorer countries in adaptation and green development, but disagreements over fairness, historical responsibility and capacity to act remain central moral disputes.

## Case studies and contemporary examples to illustrate arguments
Concrete examples make arguments persuasive in the exam and assignment. The rise of Fairtrade networks provides a useful illustration of ethical trade aimed at improving farmers’ incomes and community development. Microfinance initiatives, such as projects inspired by the Grameen Bank model, show how small loans can enable entrepreneurship, although results vary and some loans have led to debt problems. Climate impacts in low‑lying Pacific states and small island nations illustrate the human cost of sea level rise and the moral problem of climate refugees who lose homes through processes they largely did not cause. Large‑scale reforestation or community forestry projects can restore degraded land and provide incomes, while fossil fuel extraction and deforestation in some regions show the conflict between short‑term economic benefit and long‑term sustainability. When describing such examples in assessment, be specific about location, the stakeholders involved and the moral tensions — for example, when a conservation project restricts local access to resources, discuss competing claims to livelihood and ecosystem protection.

## Making an assignment work: choosing and researching your issue
For the assignment you must pick a clearly defined religious, moral or philosophical issue where more than one viewpoint exists. Good choices are not obscure; they allow you to use at least two or three reliable sources and to present a clear religious perspective alongside a secular alternative. Examples could include whether rich countries should pay climate reparations, whether trade sanctions or engagement best support development, or what ethical obligations exist toward climate migrants. Research should be organised and evidenced: use statistics, examples and statements from religious texts or leaders where appropriate. Remember the practical requirements: the research stage is expected to take about eight hours and the writing stage is completed under one hour; you must prepare a single‑side A4 Resource Sheet of no more than 200 words to take into the writing stage, and you must state the issue clearly in your assignment or no marks will be awarded. Use a mixture of primary and secondary sources and show how religious teachings or ethical theories lead to particular responses.

## Exam technique
When answering question‑paper questions, begin by carefully noting what the question asks and which perspective you should focus on. For the World Religion or Morality and Belief sections, include accurate factual knowledge early in your answer, explained in context, then move to analysis by linking belief to practice or cause to effect. When asked to present religious and non‑religious responses, clearly identify each viewpoint and give reasons and examples for them. For evaluation, aim to measure strengths and weaknesses: compare consequences, consistency and practicality of views, and then reach a reasoned conclusion that balances evidence. Use case studies to support claims but keep them concise and directly relevant. Time management is crucial; allocate your time so that longer questions get more planning and developed evaluation. When preparing the assignment, pick an issue you understand well, use varied sources, and practise writing a clear, structured argument within an hour. Make sure your Resource Sheet is focused: include a short plan, a key quote or two, and one or two statistics; remember the 200‑word limit and that failure to include the sheet carries a four‑mark penalty. Finally, use the “knowledge‑analysis‑evaluation” sequence in answers: state factual knowledge, explain and analyse implications, then evaluate to show mature judgement. This pattern matches SQA marking expectations and helps you score across the criteria.
