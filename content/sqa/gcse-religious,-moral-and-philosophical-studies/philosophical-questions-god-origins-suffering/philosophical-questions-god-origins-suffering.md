# Religious & Philosophical Questions: existence of God, origins and suffering (GCSE Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What this topic covers and why it matters
This part of the course looks at big, enduring questions: how the universe and life began, whether God exists, why suffering happens, and whether miracles occur. These questions ask for both factual knowledge and thoughtful response. You will need to explain religious perspectives and non-religious or scientific perspectives, analyse how these positions are argued, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. In exams you will be expected to present clear knowledge, show straightforward analysis and write reasoned evaluations. Understanding these questions helps you to think about how people make sense of life, the limits of scientific explanation, and how religious beliefs interact with everyday experience and public debate.

## Origins of the universe: creation stories and scientific accounts
When people ask how the universe began they encounter two broad kinds of explanation. Religious accounts often describe a creator or divine agent who brings the cosmos into being. Creation stories vary: some people read these stories literally, believing the events described happened exactly as written; others read them non-literally, treating them as symbolic or theological ways of expressing truths about God, purpose and human responsibility. Scientific accounts, by contrast, describe natural processes. The Big Bang theory explains that the universe expanded from an extremely hot, dense state and that galaxies, stars and planets formed over billions of years. Science uses observation, mathematics and testable predictions; religious accounts focus on meaning, purpose and the idea of a creator.

Many students find it helpful to recognise that these views are not always in simple opposition. Some people hold that scientific explanations describe the mechanisms by which the universe developed while religion addresses questions of meaning and why there is something rather than nothing. Others see a conflict: if science can explain origins in physical terms, they argue, the need for a divine agent is reduced. In answering questions on origins, make sure you explain the key ideas clearly, give examples of literal and non-literal readings, and show how different responses claim to answer different kinds of questions: factual how-questions or questions about purpose.

## Origins of life: evolution and creation accounts
Questions about how life began and developed on Earth require you to distinguish between the origin of life itself and the development of living forms after life began. Evolution by natural selection, as a scientific theory, explains how species change over time and how complex organisms can arise from simpler ancestors through variation and selection. For many believers, evolution is compatible with their faith: they accept evolutionary science while seeing God as the ultimate source of life or as guiding the process. Other believers reject parts of evolutionary theory and prefer a literal creation account.

When discussing origins of life, be ready to explain what evolution claims, how it is supported by fossil records and genetic evidence, and how some religious traditions interpret their sacred texts. Pointing out the difference between methodological naturalism (science seeks natural explanations) and metaphysical claims (religion may make supernatural claims) is useful. Also consider the view that scientific and religious explanations can have different scopes: science can describe mechanisms, while religion can address questions of meaning, ethics and purpose. When evaluating responses, consider how persuasive each view is for answering the particular question posed and whether combining approaches gives a fuller account.

## The existence of God: cosmological and teleological arguments and their critics
Arguments for God’s existence aim to move from observable features of the world to a conclusion that a divine being exists. Two classic arguments to know are the cosmological argument and the teleological argument. The cosmological argument, famously developed by Thomas Aquinas, begins with the fact that things in the world are contingent — they come into existence and pass away — and argues that there must be a first cause or necessary being that explains why anything exists at all. Critics challenge the need to posit a first cause, raise the problem of infinite regress, or argue that the universe could be self-explanatory through natural processes such as the Big Bang. Some scientific perspectives suggest that cosmology provides natural explanations for the universe’s origin and that invoking God is unnecessary.

The teleological argument, associated with William Paley’s watchmaker analogy, compares the apparent order and purpose in nature to a watch, arguing that design implies a designer. Modern defenders sometimes point to fine-tuning of physical constants as evidence for a designer. Critics respond that apparent design can arise through natural mechanisms like evolution, or that the appearance of order does not necessarily point to a divine designer. Naturalistic explanations and possibilities such as the multiverse are also offered as challenges. In exam answers it is important to outline both arguments clearly, show how they are supported, present standard counterarguments, and evaluate whether the arguments establish the existence of God or only invite further questions.

## The problem of suffering and evil: types, explanations and theodicies
The reality of suffering and evil is one of the strongest challenges to belief in an all-powerful, all-loving God. The problem is often framed as an apparent contradiction: if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, why does suffering exist? Distinguishing between moral evil (evils resulting from human choices, such as murder) and natural evil (suffering that results from natural events, such as earthquakes) helps organise responses.

Religious explanations include the free will defence, which argues that much moral evil comes from human freedom. According to this view, a world containing free agents capable of love and moral goodness must allow the possibility that those agents will choose wrongly. Another line is the soul-making or developmental theodicy, which suggests that suffering can build character, empathy and spiritual maturity. Some religious responses accept mystery: human beings may not be able to see God’s reasons, but trust that there is a just purpose beyond current understanding. Determinist or scientific perspectives offer different accounts: if natural processes follow laws or biological mechanisms, suffering has causes within those systems rather than moral explanations.

Critics point out difficulties with these theodicies. The free will defence may not explain natural suffering and the scale of evil can seem excessive for character-building. The “inconsistent triad” — the difficulty of reconciling God’s omnipotence, omnibenevolence and the existence of evil — remains central. In exam answers, present these explanations and their limitations, use examples to show why the problem is serious, and evaluate whether religious theodicies succeed in answering the challenge or whether they leave residual problems.

## Miracles and evidence: defining miracles and weighing explanations
Miracles are events that seem to go beyond ordinary patterns and are often taken to show divine intervention. Some miracles are scriptural — stories of healing, resurrection or extraordinary signs in sacred texts — while others are contemporary claims of healing or unlikely recoveries. A key philosophical question is whether miracles contradict fixed laws of nature or are simply extraordinary but lawful events that science does not yet fully explain.

Non-religious explanations include psychological factors, coincidence, misinterpretation, or natural causes not yet understood. Where a healing seems miraculous, medical investigation can sometimes find natural explanations or rate the event as unlikely but not supernatural. Evaluating miracle claims asks you to assess the quality of evidence, the credibility of witnesses, the possibility of alternative explanations, and whether a miracle claim is the best explanation of the facts. Some thinkers argue that a miracle is improbable and that natural explanations should be favoured, while others argue that well-attested miracles can legitimately be taken as signs of the divine.

In exam responses, clearly define what counts as a miracle, discuss scriptural and non-scriptural examples, present both religious and non-religious explanations, and weigh evidence. Remember to show that you can analyse why people find miracles convincing and why sceptics remain unconvinced.

## Interpreting religious and scientific explanations together
One practical insight for students is that religious and scientific explanations often answer different types of question. Science excels at describing processes, mechanisms and empirical patterns; religion frequently addresses questions of meaning, value and purpose. Many people find it helpful to treat the two as complementary rather than mutually exclusive. For example, someone might accept the Big Bang and evolution as scientific descriptions of how the universe and life developed, while also believing that God is the ultimate ground or sustainer of existence. Other people prefer a strictly naturalistic view that leaves no role for the supernatural. As you revise, practice explaining both kinds of response and consider whether they can be combined coherently, highlighting tensions where they cannot.

## Exam technique
To do well in this topic you must combine accurate knowledge with clear analysis and reasoned evaluation. Start answers by briefly defining key terms such as “cosmological argument”, “teleological argument”, “moral evil” and “miracle”. When explaining arguments, state their main steps simply and accurately before you comment on strengths and weaknesses. In analysis, link beliefs to consequences and implications: for example, show how accepting a free will theodicy affects views about moral responsibility and punishment. In evaluation, weigh strengths and weaknesses and reach a supported conclusion — examiners expect a balanced judgement rather than a one-sided statement.

Structure longer answers into clear paragraphs: introduce the point, explain or exemplify it, analyse it (make connections, show implications), and then evaluate it (give reasons for agreeing or disagreeing). Use specific examples to illustrate abstract ideas: mention Paley’s watchmaker as an accessible summary of the teleological argument, set out Aquinas’ chain of causation for the cosmological argument, or illustrate moral and natural evil with real-life scenarios. When you discuss scientific views, describe the kind of evidence they use and why that evidence matters. Always show that you can present both religious and non-religious perspectives and explain how each responds to the question.

For revision, practise short timed essays and past-style questions focusing on description, analysis and evaluation. Prepare one-paragraph summaries of each argument and the main objections so you can recall them quickly in the exam. For the assignment, choose an issue that allows clear comparison of religious and non-religious views, use a range of sources, state your issue clearly, and plan before you write; remember the resource sheet rules. Finally, manage your time in the exam so you can plan answers, write clearly, and leave a few minutes to review and make sure your arguments are coherent and your conclusion is well supported.
