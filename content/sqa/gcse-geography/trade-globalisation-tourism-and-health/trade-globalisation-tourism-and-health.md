## Trade and globalisation: what they are and why they matter
Globalisation describes the growing interconnectedness of people, places and economies around the world. Trade is one of its most visible expressions: goods, services, capital and information now flow across borders more quickly and at larger scale than ever before. For students this means learning to recognise patterns in world trade, the role of transport and communications, and the organisations and companies that link countries into global networks. Multinational or transnational corporations (TNCs) are key players: they locate production where costs are low and move goods to where demand is high. At the same time, changes within countries matter. Deindustrialisation in many developed economies has meant fewer jobs in manufacturing while countries such as China, India and several Southeast Asian states have seen rapid industrial growth. These shifts create winners and losers: some places gain jobs, income and infrastructure, while others face factory closures, long-term unemployment and social change. Understanding globalisation therefore requires looking at economic connections and the social and environmental effects that follow.

## Causes and consequences of inequalities in trade
Inequalities in trade arise from different starting points and advantages. Historical factors, including colonial trade patterns, created uneven access to resources and markets. Today, differences in natural resource endowment, levels of technology, types of labour and political decisions about tariffs and investment help explain why some countries export high-value goods and services while others remain reliant on primary products. Consequences are both economic and social. Rapid industrial growth in emerging economies can reduce poverty and raise incomes, but it can also mean poor working conditions, environmental damage and dependence on a narrow range of exports. In developed countries the decline of traditional industries can lead to deindustrialised towns and community decline. Environmental impacts include increased pollution, resource depletion and pressure on ecosystems. Social effects include changing migration patterns, altered family structures and new consumer cultures. Case studies make these ideas concrete: the garment industry in Bangladesh shows how low-cost production can create employment while also raising concerns about safety and workers’ rights, whereas the decline of heavy industry in parts of the UK shows the human cost of global competition.

## Managing inequalities: trade alliances, fair trade and sustainable practice
There are a range of strategies designed to reduce the negative effects of global trade and to make globalisation fairer. Trade alliances and economic blocs can boost access to markets and provide negotiating power for member states, while regulations at national and international level can protect workers and the environment. Fair trade initiatives aim to improve the incomes and bargaining power of small-scale producers by ensuring better prices, stable contracts and community support. Sustainable practices seek to reduce the environmental footprint of production and consumption, for example by encouraging resource efficiency, waste reduction and renewable energy. Public policy also matters: investment in education, training and infrastructure in poorer regions can help communities benefit from global links rather than being left behind. For classroom use, comparing different strategies and their limitations is valuable: measures that help one group may disadvantage another or create unintended environmental costs, so critical evaluation is essential.

## Tourism as a global industry: causes, types and development
Tourism has become one of the largest global industries. It grows because people generally have more leisure time, higher incomes, cheaper travel and expanding information about distant destinations. Tourism takes many forms. Mass tourism centres on high visitor volumes to a few attractions and often relies on package holidays and large resort developments. Eco-tourism, by contrast, focuses on low-impact, nature-based experiences that aim to benefit local communities and conserve ecosystems. Tourism development can be charted using theoretical models such as the Butler model, which shows how destinations move from exploration and involvement through to growth and possible consolidation or decline. Examples help illustrate the variety of experiences: Mediterranean beach resorts grew rapidly in the late twentieth century, while places such as Costa Rica promoted eco-tourism to attract visitors interested in biodiversity and conservation. New, high-value developments such as Dubai demonstrate how governments and private investors can create destinations almost from scratch, with significant economic benefits but also important environmental and social trade-offs.

## Impacts of tourism and how destinations are managed
Tourism brings economic benefits including jobs, foreign currency and investment in infrastructure, but benefits are rarely spread evenly. Financial leakage—where profits are repatriated to foreign owners—can reduce the local economic gain. Social impacts include cultural change, overcrowding and loss of local services, while environmental effects range from habitat degradation and water shortages to pollution and increased carbon emissions. Managing these impacts requires a combination of planning, regulation and community involvement. Zoning, visitor caps and permit systems can limit physical damage at sensitive sites, while economic measures such as encouraging locally owned businesses and limiting large-scale foreign ownership can help retain income locally. Education and interpretation help visitors understand why careful behaviour matters. Practical classroom case studies include Machu Picchu, where visitor limits and careful pathway design have been introduced to protect fragile archaeology, and the Great Barrier Reef, where conservation management seeks to balance tourism, fishing and coastal development while addressing the added pressure of climate change.

## Health as a global issue: patterns, causes and responses
Health is closely linked to levels of development and to migration, urbanisation and the environment. Some diseases are more prevalent in poorer countries because of limited access to clean water, sanitation and healthcare, while wealthier societies face rising rates of non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and certain cancers linked to lifestyle. The global distribution of disease is therefore uneven and changing. HIV/AIDS remains a major challenge in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, with profound social and economic consequences, while malaria affects large parts of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia and Latin America, impacting child mortality and productivity. In richer countries, heart disease and obesity reflect different patterns of risk. Managing health issues requires interventions at many levels. Preventive strategies include vaccination programmes, distribution of mosquito nets and improved sanitation, while treatment and care need functioning health services and trained staff. International organisations, national governments and local communities all play roles. Public health campaigns, investment in clean water and sanitation, and programmes to improve maternal and child healthcare have produced dramatic improvements in many places, but persistent inequalities mean that health remains a central global challenge.

## Skills, fieldwork and preparing your assignment
Success in this topic depends as much on practical skills as on factual knowledge. Map skills, including four- and six-figure grid references, interpreting contour patterns and measuring distances, are frequently tested and are useful in fieldwork. You must also be comfortable extracting information from graphs, tables and diagrams and presenting findings clearly. Fieldwork can link trade, tourism or health to a local context: a small survey of visitor numbers in a local park, a study of shop types and supply chains in a town centre, or an audit of local health services can all be turned into useful evidence. For the course assignment you will research a chosen geographical issue and bring processed information into a supervised production stage. Processed Information is limited to two single-sided A4 sheets or one single-sided A3 sheet and must not contain drafts of your final report. The research stage should be used to gather a range of sources, including statistics, maps and case study details, and to reflect on the best way to present your findings. When writing up in the supervised production stage you must work independently and be ready to explain your methods and conclusions clearly, supporting them with the evidence you gathered. Teachers commonly advise choosing a focused question, using a mix of numerical and descriptive evidence, and making sure the link between data and conclusion is explicit.

## Exam technique
Answering exam questions successfully combines clear knowledge with careful use of evidence and skills. Start by reading each question carefully and underline key terms such as “describe”, “explain”, “compare” and “evaluate” to make sure your response matches the demand. When a question asks for examples, use named case studies rather than general statements; specific detail gains marks. For questions that require use of maps or graphs, refer directly to the source: describe the main pattern, pick out one or two precise features and explain their significance. For extended answers, structure your response with a short introduction that defines the issue, a middle that develops two or three clear points supported by evidence, and a concluding sentence that sums up your judgement. Time management is important: allocate more time to questions worth more marks and leave a few minutes at the end to check calculations and spelling where it matters. Practise past question papers under timed conditions and use examiner feedback from specimen papers to understand the level of detail expected. For the assignment, choose a manageable topic, gather a balanced range of evidence during the research stage, and remember that the production stage is strictly supervised with limits on resources; prepare Processed Information carefully while keeping it free of any draft text of your final report.
