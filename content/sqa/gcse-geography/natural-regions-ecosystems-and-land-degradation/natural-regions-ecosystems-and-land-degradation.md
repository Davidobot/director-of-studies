# Natural regions, ecosystems and land degradation (GCSE Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What are natural regions and ecosystems?
Natural regions are broad areas of the Earth with similar climate, vegetation and landforms. They are often described by climate type — for example tundra or equatorial tropical forest — and by the ecosystems that develop under those conditions. An ecosystem is the living community (plants, animals, microbes) together with the non-living parts of the environment (soil, water, air, climate) and the interactions between them. When studying natural regions it helps to think about three linked elements: the climate that shapes the region, the characteristic plants and animals that live there, and the ways people use and affect those places. In exam answers you should describe each element clearly, explain how they connect, and give specific examples to show your understanding.

## Tundra: climate, life and pressures
The tundra is a cold natural region found near the Arctic and at high latitudes. Winters are long and severe, summers are short and cool, and precipitation is low, often falling as snow. A key physical feature is permafrost — ground that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years. Vegetation is low and sparse, made up mainly of mosses, lichens, dwarf shrubs and grasses adapted to short growing seasons and shallow active layers of soil. Animal life includes species adapted to cold and seasonal food availability, such as reindeer, arctic foxes and migratory birds.

Human activity in tundra areas has increased in recent decades through resource extraction, infrastructure and tourism. Extraction of oil and gas requires roads and drilling pads that can disrupt the fragile soils and vegetation, and permafrost thaw caused by climate warming can damage buildings and pipelines. When warming melts permafrost, previously frozen organic matter decomposes and releases greenhouse gases, creating a feedback loop that accelerates warming. In exam answers you should explain the role of permafrost and the special adaptations of tundra plants and animals, and link human pressures to physical changes and social impacts.

## Equatorial tropical forests: climate, biodiversity and human use
Equatorial tropical forests, often called rainforests, exist near the equator where temperatures are high and rainfall is abundant and reliable throughout the year. This stable, warm and wet climate supports exceptionally high biodiversity and complex vegetation layers, from emergent trees through closed canopy to understory plants and ground plants. Tropical forests are home to a large proportion of the planet’s species and provide many ecosystem services: they store carbon, regulate water cycles, protect soils and supply food, timber and medicines.

Human use ranges from traditional sustainable practices by indigenous peoples to large-scale commercial activities. Clearing for agriculture, cattle ranching, commercial logging and infrastructure leads to loss of habitat and biodiversity. Forest clearance also releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change. When writing about tropical forests in assessments, give clear descriptions of the climate and structure, explain why biodiversity is so high, and use concrete examples of how and why forests are cleared as well as the consequences of that clearance.

## Processes and types of land degradation
Land degradation describes the decline in the productive capacity of land and the loss of its ecosystem functions. Common processes include deforestation, soil erosion, desertification, salinisation, peatland degradation and permafrost thaw. Deforestation removes the tree cover that protects soils and cycles nutrients; exposed soils become vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. In semi-arid areas, overgrazing and poor farming methods can strip vegetation and set off desertification, where land becomes progressively more arid and less productive. Irrigation without proper drainage can cause salinisation of soils, reducing crop yields. In colder regions, degradation can involve peatland drainage or thawing permafrost, releasing carbon and damaging habitats. When describing these processes, link the physical mechanisms — such as runoff, wind erosion or groundwater rise — with human actions that trigger them, and show how they affect ecosystem services like water regulation and soil fertility.

## Impacts on people and the environment
The impacts of land degradation are wide-ranging and often interlinked. Environmentally, degradation reduces biodiversity, disrupts water cycles, increases greenhouse gas emissions and causes landscape change such as gullying or desert expansion. For people, the consequences can be loss of livelihood, food insecurity and forced migration. For example, when topsoil is lost from farmland the productivity of that land falls, farmers may need to expand into marginal areas, and local food prices can rise. In coastal and small island contexts, mangrove clearance or coral reef damage reduces protection against storms and threatens fisheries. It is important when explaining impacts to separate immediate effects — such as crop failure after a drought — from longer-term and indirect consequences, such as rural poverty, conflict over resources and reduced resilience to future shocks. Good exam answers balance environmental and social impacts and explain cause-and-effect chains.

## Managing and reducing land degradation: strategies and examples
Strategies to manage land degradation range from local, community-led actions to national and international policy. At the local level, techniques such as sustainable agriculture, agroforestry, contour farming, terracing and reduced tillage help conserve soil and water. Reforestation and afforestation restore tree cover and stabilise soils, while restoring peatlands or wetland areas helps lock away carbon and reinstate natural hydrology. In semi-arid regions, projects that combine planting drought-resistant trees, improving grazing management and supporting small-scale irrigation can reduce desertification. At larger scales, protected areas conserve biodiversity, and economic measures such as payments for ecosystem services, carbon credits and incentives for sustainable land use (for example through certification schemes) encourage better practice. Integrated river basin management and land-use planning reduce conflicting demands on land and water. Effective management often requires participation by local communities, because long-term success depends on local knowledge, incentives and ownership of solutions. When answering questions on solutions, show clear links between the problem identified and the most appropriate, realistic measures to address it, and support your points with examples.

## Case studies to illustrate key ideas
Case studies make theoretical points concrete and are highly useful in exams. The Amazon Basin provides a clear example of tropical forest loss driven by cattle ranching, soy cultivation and road-building; the consequences include biodiversity loss, regional climate impacts and emissions of stored carbon. In the Sahel region of Africa, overgrazing, population pressure and variable rainfall have contributed to soil degradation and desertification; successful interventions there include farmer-managed natural regeneration and agroforestry that restore tree cover and improve soil fertility. In Scotland, peatland drainage for forestry and agriculture has released carbon and damaged habitats; recent restoration efforts focus on re-wetting peat, blocking drainage channels and re-establishing native vegetation to store carbon and improve water quality. Arctic examples show how permafrost thaw affects infrastructure and releases greenhouse gases, illustrating a direct feedback between local degradation and global climate. Use case studies to provide specific facts — for instance approximate rates of deforestation or an example project name — but ensure you explain the link between the facts and the broader processes you are describing.

## Linking geographical skills to natural regions and degradation
A strong answer in this topic often uses geographical skills to support explanations. Maps help show the distribution of natural regions, where degradation is worst and how population density or land use overlaps with fragile environments. Graphs and tables can demonstrate trends in deforestation rates, soil loss or precipitation change, and interpreting these sources is a common exam requirement. Fieldwork skills are also relevant: simple soil tests, vegetation surveys and photographic evidence can provide primary data for an assignment on local degradation. When you use a map or graph in an answer, describe what it shows, pick out the important data, and explain how that evidence supports your point about causes, effects or solutions.

## Exam technique
Answer questions by first identifying the command word and the focus required: do you need to describe, explain, compare, evaluate or suggest solutions? Start with a short introduction that defines the key term or frames the issue, then develop paragraphs that follow a clear logical order. For a describe question concentrate on accurate, specific detail about features and processes. For explain questions make sure each point shows cause and effect: state the cause, describe the process it triggers and explain the resulting effect. Always use examples to illustrate general points; case studies or local examples add credibility and make answers more convincing. When asked to evaluate or assess management strategies, weigh advantages and disadvantages and show awareness of constraints such as cost, governance and local acceptance. If a question includes a map, photograph or graph, refer explicitly to the source: describe what it shows, extract the key facts and use those facts to support your argument.

In extended answers aim for a clear structure of several linked paragraphs that build your argument. Use geographical terminology accurately, but avoid long, unsupported lists of facts; instead, explain how each fact links to the question. When discussing solutions, consider multiple scales — individual, community, national and international — and explain why an integrated approach is often most effective. For the assignment component, choose a focused topic that you can research thoroughly, collect reliable Processed Information and practise presenting numerical and graphical evidence. Remember the practical rules for the assignment: prepare well during the research stage, ensure Processed Information is concise and relevant, and use the production time efficiently to present a clear, evidence-based conclusion. Finally, check your time in the exam, re-read each answer to correct errors, and make sure every point you make contributes to answering the question directly.
