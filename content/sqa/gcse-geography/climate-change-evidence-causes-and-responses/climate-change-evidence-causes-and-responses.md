# Climate change: evidence, causes and responses (GCSE Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What climate change means and why it matters
Climate change describes the long-term shift in average weather patterns and the balance of energy in the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans. It is not just a change in temperature but a change in rainfall patterns, sea levels, storm frequency and biodiversity. For people and places, the consequences are wide ranging: more frequent heatwaves and floods, increased risk to crops and water supplies, rising sea levels that threaten low-lying coasts and small island states, and damage to ecosystems such as coral reefs and Arctic sea ice. Understanding climate change means looking at the evidence for past and present change, the natural and human causes behind it, and the strategies that societies can use to reduce harm and adapt to the changes that are already underway.

## Evidence for past and recent climate change
Evidence for climate change comes from many different sources and from different timescales. Ice cores drilled from Greenland and Antarctica contain layers of snow and trapped air that record changes in temperature and the concentration of greenhouse gases over hundreds of thousands of years. These records show that global climate has varied naturally through glacial and interglacial cycles, but also that recent rises in carbon dioxide and methane match the start of the Industrial Revolution and are unusually rapid in geological terms. Tree rings and pollen records preserve information about climate over hundreds to thousands of years, while historical sources such as ships’ logs and written temperature records extend our knowledge over the last few centuries. For the most recent decades, thermometer measurements and satellite observations provide clear numerical data. Instrumental records show that global average temperature has risen by roughly a degree Celsius or more since the late 19th century, glaciers around the world are retreating, Arctic sea ice and mountain snow cover are shrinking, and global mean sea level has risen by the order of centimetres to around a couple of tenths of a metre since 1900. Together, these lines of evidence build a consistent picture: the planet is warming and the rate of change in the modern era is linked with human activity.

## How the greenhouse effect and the carbon cycle work
To explain why the planet warms, it helps to understand the greenhouse effect and the carbon cycle. The Earth receives energy from the Sun in the form of shortwave radiation; the surface absorbs some of this energy and emits longwave (infrared) radiation back to space. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—most importantly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)—absorb some of that outgoing longwave radiation and re-radiate it back toward the surface, producing a warming effect that makes the planet habitable. Human activities have increased the concentration of these gases, principally by burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), removing forests that would otherwise store carbon, and through agriculture and industrial processes that release methane and nitrous oxide. The carbon cycle describes the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, land and living organisms; when emissions exceed the capacity of sinks such as forests and oceans to absorb carbon, atmospheric concentrations rise and the greenhouse effect strengthens. There are also important feedbacks: warming can increase water vapour (itself a greenhouse gas), change cloud patterns, and reduce ice cover (which lowers the Earth’s reflectivity), all of which can amplify warming.

## Natural drivers and how they differ from human causes
Climate has always been influenced by natural factors. Over long timescales, cycles in the Earth’s orbit (Milankovitch cycles), variations in solar output and major volcanic eruptions have driven changes between colder and warmer periods. Volcanic eruptions, for example, can inject aerosols into the stratosphere that temporarily cool the planet by reflecting sunlight. However, natural drivers cannot explain the pattern of warming observed since the mid-20th century. The speed, global scale and the chemical fingerprint of the increase in greenhouse gases point to human activity as the dominant cause of recent warming. In short, natural factors are important for understanding past changes, but the current trend is best explained by enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations from human sources.

## Observed and projected impacts
The effects of climate change are already visible in many places and are projected to increase in severity unless emissions are reduced. Warmer average temperatures change precipitation patterns, increasing drought in some regions and heavier rainfall and floods in others. Heatwaves have become more frequent and intense, increasing health risks and causing economic disruption. Rising sea levels, caused by thermal expansion of warming oceans and the melting of land ice, threaten coastal communities and infrastructure, with low-lying countries and small islands particularly vulnerable. Ecosystems are affected: coral reefs suffer from bleaching when water temperatures rise, species ranges shift polewards or to higher altitude, and agricultural zones may change, affecting food security. Looking ahead, climate models project a range of possible futures depending on how much greenhouse gas emissions continue. Lower-emission pathways keep warming closer to the internationally agreed goals, while higher-emission scenarios produce greater warming, more sea-level rise and larger impacts on people and nature. These projections are useful for planning: governments, communities and businesses use them to understand risks and to decide the balance between cutting emissions and adapting to unavoidable change.

## Responses: mitigation and adaptation
Addressing climate change requires two linked responses: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation aims to reduce the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and enhance carbon sinks so that future warming is limited. Practical mitigation includes switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables such as wind, solar and hydro, improving energy efficiency in buildings and transport, changing land use practices to store more carbon in soils and forests, and industrial measures like capturing and storing CO2. International agreements provide a framework for collective action, while national policies such as carbon pricing, subsidies for low-emission technologies and regulations on emissions shape how countries pursue mitigation. Adaptation means adjusting to the effects of climate change that are already happening or expected. Examples include building flood defences, improving water management to cope with droughts and variable rainfall, changing agricultural practices and crop choices, designing heatwave plans and strengthening health systems, and planning for managed retreat where coasts become unsustainable to defend. Effective response combines both approaches: mitigation reduces the size of the future problem, while adaptation reduces vulnerability now. Local actions like recycling, reducing food miles and improving home insulation complement national and international strategies.

## Case studies and classroom examples
Using concrete examples helps to make the ideas of climate change real. Bangladesh is frequently used as a case study for vulnerability: a low-lying, densely populated delta with regular cyclones and flooding. Rising sea levels and storm surges increase the risk to homes, farmland and livelihoods, and the country pursues a mix of adaptation measures such as coastal embankments, early warning systems and livelihood diversification to reduce vulnerability. The Great Barrier Reef and other coral systems provide an example of ecological impacts and management challenges: increased sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, while local measures such as reducing pollution and creating marine protected areas can improve resilience. In the Arctic, retreating sea ice has opened new shipping routes and heightened interest in resource access; this illustrates how climate change can create new economic opportunities for some while accelerating risks to indigenous communities and fragile ecosystems. In the UK, recent heatwaves and storm events demonstrate local impacts and the need for preparedness: public health alerts, changes to infrastructure design, and investment in flood defences are all part of adaptation. In each case study, it is useful to weigh the causes, the observable and likely effects, and the range of mitigations and adaptations that have been proposed or implemented.

## Using data and skills in geography assessments
Geography assessments expect you to interpret and use different forms of evidence: maps, graphs, tables and photographs. When you are given a graph of temperature anomalies, a map of vulnerable coastlines, or a table of greenhouse gas emissions, start by describing what the source shows and then explain the significance. For example, a steadily rising line on a CO2 graph can be described as an increasing concentration linked to human activities; you should then explain why this matters in terms of the greenhouse effect and likely impacts such as sea-level rise. Practice converting information between formats: read data from a chart and explain it in words, or summarise a long passage into a concise explanation. Fieldwork and local data collection can strengthen your understanding and provide material for assignments: a local investigation into flood risk or energy use can demonstrate the practical application of geographical skills. Remember that a balanced answer often combines global context, specific examples and a clear, evidence-based conclusion.

## Exam technique
In exams, read the question carefully and pay attention to command words: describe requires detail about features or patterns, explain requires causes and consequences, and evaluate asks you to weigh strengths and weaknesses before reaching a judgement. Always use data and examples where possible; a specific case study (for instance, coastal flooding in Bangladesh or recent UK heatwaves) will strengthen your explanation. When interpreting graphs or maps, state what the source shows first, then link it to geographical processes or human responses. For extended questions, structure your answer with a clear opening sentence, two or three developed points each with explanation and evidence, and a concluding sentence that directly answers the question. Manage your time so that longer questions get proportionally more time and leave a few minutes at the end to check calculations and to ensure you have answered every part of the question. For the coursework assignment, plan your research carefully, keep clear Processed Information notes within the permitted sheets, and practise presenting findings in a concise, evidence-supported way; during the controlled production stage make sure your writing is focused, uses the processed materials, and answers the research question directly. Practise past papers under timed conditions and ask for feedback to improve clarity, use of data and geographical reasoning.
