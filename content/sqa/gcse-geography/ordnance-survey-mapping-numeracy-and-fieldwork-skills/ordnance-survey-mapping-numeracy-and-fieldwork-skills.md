# Ordnance Survey mapping, numeracy and fieldwork skills (GCSE Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Why these skills matter
Ordnance Survey mapping, numeracy and fieldwork skills lie at the heart of geographical study. They turn places and processes from abstract ideas into measurable, testable evidence. Being confident with maps and map-based measurements lets you locate features, describe landscapes and plan fieldwork. Strong numeracy and graphical skills let you extract patterns from data, test hypotheses and show clear, evidence-based conclusions. Fieldwork skills bring classroom theory to life: carefully collected primary data can be analysed and presented to support explanations about rivers, coasts, urban areas or climate impacts. Together these skills are what examiners look for in the question paper and what you must demonstrate practically in the assignment.

## Ordnance Survey map basics and grid references
Ordnance Survey (OS) maps use a grid of eastings and northings to locate features. A four‑figure grid reference identifies a whole grid square by giving the easting first and then the northing; it tells you the square in which a feature lies. A six‑figure reference refines this by dividing that square into tenths and estimating the position to the nearest 100 metres. To find a six‑figure reference you first read the lower-left corner of the square (the two-digit easting and northing), then estimate how many tenths across the square the feature is, and finally how many tenths up the square it is. Practise this on sample maps until the steps become automatic: find the square, read the two base numbers, then add the estimated tenths to produce six digits. OS maps also rely on a consistent set of symbols and colours: black for buildings, brown for contours, blue for water, green for vegetation and named symbols for features such as churches or quarries. Learning the common symbols speeds up interpretation and saves time in exams.

## Contours, relief and cross-sections
Contours are the lines that join points of equal height and are the primary way OS maps show relief. The spacing of contours indicates slope steepness: close contours signpost steep ground, widely spaced contours gentle slopes. Spot heights and trig points give precise elevations that are useful when calculating gradients or drawing cross-sections. To produce a cross-section you trace a straight line across the map, mark each contour the line crosses and plot those heights on graph paper to reveal the shape of the land. When asked to calculate gradient, use the vertical change divided by horizontal distance. For example, if a hilltop is at 160 metres and the valley at 40 metres, the vertical change is 120 metres. If the horizontal distance measured on the map (and converted using the scale) is 600 metres, the gradient is 120 ÷ 600 = 0.2, which can be expressed as 1:5. Practise converting gradients into ratios and percentages and be ready to show your calculation steps in the exam.

## Measuring distance and direction on maps
Map scale links map measurements to real distance. On a 1:50 000 map one centimetre represents 500 metres on the ground, while on a 1:25 000 map one centimetre represents 250 metres. To measure a curving path use a piece of string to follow the route, then lay the string along the map ruler and convert using the scale. When converting measurements, write units clearly: if a measured map length is 7.2 cm on a 1:50 000 map, the ground distance is 7.2 × 500 m = 3,600 m or 3.6 km. Direction is usually required as a compass bearing measured clockwise from north. Use a protractor aligned with the map’s north lines to measure the bearing to the nearest degree, and remember to state whether you are using grid north or magnetic north if the question asks for it. In fieldwork, pacing, GPS and odometers can verify distances; in assessments, always show your working and the scale used.

## Linking maps with photographs, sketches and transects
Exams often ask you to relate maps to photographs or to produce field sketches. The key is annotation: identify features on the photograph and match them to identifiable map features using grid references or descriptions of relative location. A good field sketch is not an artistic drawing but a simplified, labelled diagram that highlights important features and processes. Include annotations that explain what the feature shows and why it is important. Transects and cross-sections bridge map study and field observation; a transect is a line through a landscape along which you make regular observations or measurements. When describing a transect, explain the sampling interval and how observations change along the line so a reader understands patterns in land use, vegetation or slope.

## Numeracy and graphical skills for geography
Numeracy in geography covers everything from simple calculations of percentages and means to selecting the right graph to show a pattern. Always choose the graph that fits the story you want to tell: line graphs are best for changes over time, bar charts for comparing categories, scatter plots for testing relationships and pie charts for showing proportions. When you plot a graph, label both axes with quantities and units, choose an evenly spaced scale, and plot points accurately. If you are comparing two variables it is useful to draw a best-fit line and comment on the strength and direction of any relationship. For descriptive statistics, be able to calculate the mean as a central value, the range to show spread, and use percentages to compare different-sized areas or populations. When handling rates—birth rates, death rates or disease incidence—express them per 1,000 or per 100,000 clearly so comparisons are meaningful. Examiners reward clear presentation and an explanation of what the numbers mean for people or places.

## Planning, conducting and recording fieldwork
Good fieldwork begins with clear aims and a plan for how to collect reliable data. Define a focused question, choose methods that will answer it and select a sampling strategy suited to the environment: systematic transects for studying change across a shore or urban zone, random sampling to avoid bias when estimating vegetation cover, and stratified sampling to ensure all land uses are represented. Prepare equipment such as tape measures, clinometers for slope, quadrats for vegetation counts, flow meters for river velocity, hand-held GPS or smart phones for locations, clipboards and waterproof data sheets. Before going out, carry out a risk assessment and make sure everyone knows safety procedures, meeting points and what to do in an emergency. Informed consent and respecting privacy are necessary when collecting data involving people; anonymise any personal data in the write-up. Record raw data clearly in tables while in the field and note any unusual events or weather that could affect results.

## Processing and evaluating field data
Back in the classroom you will process raw field data to produce the Processed Information allowed in the assignment and to prepare analysis for reports. Use spreadsheets to check calculations, compute averages, convert units and produce graphs. Present spatial data as annotated maps or cross-sections and make sure all maps have a scale bar, north arrow and legend. When interpreting results, link numerical patterns to physical or human processes: explain why river velocity might increase downstream or why housing density changes toward the city centre. A critical evaluation of fieldwork is essential: discuss possible sources of error such as measurement inaccuracies, sampling bias, changes in conditions during sampling, and limitations of instruments. Consider reliability and validity—could the same method be repeated with similar results and does your data actually measure what you intended? Finally, draw evidence-based conclusions that answer your original question and suggest realistic improvements for future investigations.

## The assignment: Processed Information and controlled conditions
The course assignment tests your ability to design and carry out a small investigation, and to present evidence under controlled conditions. During research you may use a wide range of resources and collect primary data, but when you come to the production of evidence you must work independently under strict supervision for a maximum of one hour and you may only use processed information on up to two single-sided A4 sheets (or one single-sided A3 sheet). Processed Information should contain the results of your research (tables, graphs, maps) but must not include draft answers, prepared conclusions or model text for the assignment itself. Teachers may give reasonable help during the research stage—advice on topic choice, sources and organisation—but they must not provide model answers or detailed feedback on drafts. If you fail to submit Processed Information a penalty is applied, so plan carefully and ensure your processed sheets are concise, relevant and well organised to support your one-hour write-up.

## Exam technique
Read each question carefully and note command words such as describe, explain, compare, suggest and evaluate; they tell you how much detail and what kind of answer is required. For mapping questions always show working: give grid references, record the scale you used for distance calculations, show the arithmetic for gradient or area conversions and label any sketches or cross-sections you draw. When interpreting graphs and maps, use evidence—quoting numbers, compass directions and feature names—to support your points. In numerical questions convert units plainly and include final answers with sensible units and appropriate significant figures. For the assignment and longer exam answers structure paragraphs so they begin with a clear point, followed by evidence and then explanation. Time management matters: allocate time to each section according to its marks, leave a few minutes to check answers and make sure any labelled diagrams are neat and readable. Practise past paper questions under timed conditions, include full calculations and annotated sketches in your revision, and become familiar with producing concise Processed Information so you can make the most of the supervised write-up. Clear evidence, accurate calculations and logical explanations are the most reliable route to higher grades.
