# Environmental hazards: earthquakes, volcanoes and storms (GCSE Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: what environmental hazards are and why they matter
Environmental hazards are natural physical events — such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tropical storms — that have the potential to cause harm to people, property and the environment. It is important to distinguish between a natural hazard and a natural disaster: a hazard is a physical process with the capacity to cause damage, while a disaster is what happens when a hazard affects vulnerable people and causes serious loss. Geography studies these hazards to understand where they happen, why they happen, how people are affected, and what can be done to reduce risk. Learning about environmental hazards also develops practical skills you will need in SQA National 5 assessment: interpreting maps, graphs and charts; explaining physical processes; and using case studies to evaluate management strategies. Real-world examples such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption in Iceland and typhoons in the Philippines help to make these ideas concrete and show differences in impact and response between more and less developed countries.

## Types and causes: how earthquakes, volcanoes and tropical storms form
Earthquakes, volcanoes and tropical storms form by different physical processes, often related to plate tectonics and atmospheric conditions. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy along faults in the Earth’s crust; most occur at plate boundaries where plates converge, diverge or slide past each other. Volcanoes form where magma reaches the surface, commonly at subduction zones where one plate sinks beneath another, at mid-ocean ridges where plates pull apart, or at hotspots where a plume of hot material rises through the mantle. Volcanic eruptions vary from gentle lava flows to explosive ash-producing events depending on magma composition. Tropical storms (called hurricanes or typhoons in different ocean basins) develop over warm tropical oceans when sea surface temperatures exceed about 26°C. Warm water fuels rising air, low pressure develops at the surface, and the Coriolis effect causes the system to spin and organise into a storm with spiralling bands and often a calm eye. Understanding these causes helps explain the global distribution of hazards and why some places are at higher risk than others.

## Impacts on people and landscapes: immediate and longer-term effects
The impacts of hazards can be immediate and devastating or slow and long-lasting. Immediate impacts include loss of life, injuries, the destruction of homes and infrastructure, and damage to transport and utilities. For example, strong earthquake shaking can collapse buildings, while the ash and lava from eruptions can bury farmland and disrupt air travel. Tropical storms bring intense rainfall, coastal storm surge and strong winds, often causing flooding, coastal erosion and widespread damage to buildings and crops. Longer-term impacts include economic disruption, loss of livelihoods, environmental degradation, public health problems and population displacement. Secondary hazards often follow primary events: earthquakes may trigger landslides and tsunamis; volcanic ash can contaminate water and soil; flooding from storms may lead to outbreaks of disease. The pattern of impacts also depends on local factors such as building standards, population density, preparedness and the capacity of emergency services. In wealthier countries economic losses tend to be very high because there is more property to damage, but death tolls are often lower due to stronger governance, planning and infrastructure. In poorer countries, the human cost — deaths, injuries and long-term poverty — is frequently much greater.

## Why people live in hazardous areas and the concept of vulnerability
People continue to live in hazard-prone areas for a variety of reasons. Volcanic soils are often highly fertile, supporting productive agriculture; coastal and river locations provide access to trade, fishing and transport; geothermal energy and tourism bring economic benefits; and historical settlement patterns and social ties keep communities in place. The decision to live in these areas is a balance between benefits and risks. Geography introduces the idea of vulnerability: the degree to which people and places are susceptible to harm from a hazard. Vulnerability depends on physical exposure, housing quality, wealth, health, education and governance. Exposure is about being in the path of the hazard; capacity to cope and recover depends on resources, planning and social networks. This is why the same event can be a disaster in one country and a manageable hazard in another. Understanding vulnerability helps when analysing case studies and when evaluating which management strategies will be most effective for a particular place.

## Prediction, planning and preparedness: reducing risk before hazards strike
Reducing the risk posed by hazards involves a mix of prediction, planning and preparedness. Prediction aims to give advance warning so people can take action. For earthquakes long-term prediction can identify higher-risk zones through monitoring of seismic activity and historical records, but short-term prediction remains difficult. Volcanoes are often more predictable: signs such as earthquakes beneath a volcano, ground deformation and changes in gas emissions give warnings of an eruption. Tropical storms are well tracked by meteorological satellites and forecasting models, allowing several days’ warning of their path and intensity. Planning and preparedness include land-use zoning to avoid building in the most dangerous areas, strict building codes designed to resist shaking or high winds, the creation of evacuation routes and shelters, public education programmes, and drills. Nature-based solutions such as maintaining mangrove forests and coastal dunes can reduce the impact of storm surge and erosion. Prepared communities with good communication systems, emergency supplies and practiced evacuation plans can dramatically reduce death and injury when hazards occur.

## Response, recovery and mitigation: what happens after an event
The immediate response to a hazard focuses on search and rescue, emergency medical care, temporary shelter, food and water and the restoration of critical services. International and national agencies often cooperate to provide rapid humanitarian aid. Recovery is the longer process of rebuilding homes and infrastructure, restoring livelihoods and rehabilitating the environment. Mitigation means taking steps to prevent or lessen future harm: rebuilding to higher standards, relocating vulnerable communities, investing in early-warning systems and improving land management. Insurance and financial mechanisms can help speed recovery and spread financial risk. Successful recovery also involves community participation and long-term planning to increase resilience. Case study comparisons are instructive: Japan’s strict building codes and tsunami defences reduced casualties in many earthquakes, while the 2010 Haiti earthquake showed how weak building regulation and poverty can lead to catastrophic human loss and a prolonged recovery.

## Using evidence and case studies: maps, graphs and numerical data
Geography assessments and the National 5 assignment expect you to use a range of evidence to support explanations. Hazard maps show zones of risk for earthquakes, volcanoes and storms and are useful for land-use planning and communicating risk. Graphs and tables can display trends in frequency, intensity or economic losses; for example, a storm track map combined with a chart of economic damage helps explain why certain regions experience higher losses. In case studies always include named places and specific facts: the magnitude and location of an earthquake, the type of volcano and eruption style, or the category and track of a tropical cyclone, followed by clear explanation of impacts and management. When researching an assignment you will collect processed information; make sure this is concise, relevant and not a draft of your final report. Use numerical evidence to strengthen points — casualty figures, number displaced, costs of damage, or evacuation times — and interpret what those numbers mean for the affected community. Remember that judgement about reliability and relevance of sources is part of good geographical practice.

## Exam technique
Answering questions well requires clear structure, relevant examples and effective use of evidence. Begin by reading the question carefully and underlining command words such as “describe,” “explain,” “compare” or “assess.” If a definition is needed, give a short, clear one before you proceed. Use the PEE approach — make a Point, give Evidence (a specific example or datum), and Explain how the evidence supports the point. For questions on hazards always cover causes, impacts and management: explain why the hazard happens, who is affected and how, then evaluate methods used to predict, prevent or respond. When asked to compare developed and developing countries, focus on differences in vulnerability, impacts and capacity to respond, and use named case studies to illustrate both sides. Include short- and long-term effects and be explicit about which scale (local, national, global) you are discussing. For higher-mark answers aim to evaluate as well as describe: weigh strengths and limitations of management strategies, consider economic and social trade-offs, and suggest reasonable improvements. In the assignment, choose a clear question, gather processed information carefully and ensure your final production stage is completed under the controlled conditions required by SQA — do not include drafts in your processed information and make sure you can reach a supported conclusion. Finally, practice past paper questions under timed conditions, use diagrams or simple labelled sketches where helpful to explain processes, and always check your work for clarity and that you have answered every part of the question.
