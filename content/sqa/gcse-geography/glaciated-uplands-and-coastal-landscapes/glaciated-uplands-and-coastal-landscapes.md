# Glaciated uplands and coastal landscapes (GCSE Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: why these landscapes matter
Glaciated uplands and coastal landscapes are two contrasting types of physical environment found across the United Kingdom. Both are shaped by powerful natural processes — ice moving across the land in uplands, and waves and currents working on the shore — yet they interact with people in similar ways: they provide resources, places to live and work, areas for tourism and recreation, and sometimes present hazards. For revision it helps to think of upland glacial landscapes as the product of cold-climate erosion and deposition during past ice ages, and coastal landscapes as the result of continual wave action, weathering and sediment movement. Understanding the processes that create the characteristic landforms, being able to name and describe those landforms, and explaining how humans use and manage these areas are key skills for the exam.

## Glaciated uplands: processes that create the landscape
Glaciated uplands were carved during periods of cold climate when valley glaciers and ice sheets moved over high ground. Two erosion processes are especially important: abrasion and plucking. Abrasion occurs as rock fragments already trapped in the base and sides of a glacier grind over the bedrock like sandpaper, smoothing and polishing surfaces. Plucking happens when meltwater penetrates cracks in the bedrock, refreezes, and pulls blocks of rock away as the ice moves. Freeze–thaw weathering is also significant on upland slopes: water enters cracks during warmer parts of the day, freezes at night, expands and breaks rock apart, producing scree slopes. Over time these processes deepen and widen valleys and sculpt distinctive glacial landforms. It is useful to remember that many of the sharp features in glaciated landscapes are the result of ice exploiting weaknesses in the bedrock and leaving behind steep, dramatic shapes where the ice had most power.

## Key glacial landforms and how they form
A corrie (or cirque) is an armchair-shaped hollow on a mountainside formed where snow accumulates and turns to ice. Nivation and repeated freeze–thaw help enlarge the hollow; the rotating movement of a small glacier deepens it by abrasion and plucking. After the ice melts, a corrie may hold a small lake called a tarn. An arête is a narrow, knife-edged ridge that separates two cirques; it forms as glaciers erode back into either side of a ridge. Where three or more cirques erode towards a point, a pyramidal peak (sometimes called a horn) can develop; the Matterhorn-style peak is a dramatic example of this process on a larger scale. U-shaped valleys are perhaps the clearest signs of glacier modification of earlier V-shaped river valleys: a glacier widens and straightens a river valley into a broad, steep-sided, flat-bottomed U shape. Hanging valleys occur when smaller tributary glaciers are not able to erode as deeply as a main glacier, and the side valleys are left ‘hanging’ above the main valley floor — waterfalls commonly mark the junctions. Truncated spurs are former interlocking spurs of a river valley that have been cut off and steepened at their ends by the passing glacier, leaving steep, cliff-like ends where once the river wound around them.

## Coastal processes that build and reshape shores
Coastal landscapes are continually reshaped by marine processes and the geology of the shoreline. Waves remove material from the coast by hydraulic action, where trapped air in cracks is compressed and forces rock apart, and by abrasion, where pebbles and sand thrown against the cliff wear it away. Attrition reduces the size ofrock particles as they collide with each other in the surf, while solution (corrosion) dissolves soluble minerals in cliffs and shorelines. The type of waves that reach the coast matters: destructive waves, with a strong backwash, remove material and steepen beaches; constructive waves, with a stronger swash, deposit material and build beaches. Longshore drift transports sediment along the coast in the direction of the prevailing wind; this movement is central to the formation of depositional features such as spits and sand bars. The rock type and structure — whether cliffs are made of hard resistant rocks or softer, more easily eroded strata, and whether bedding planes are concordant or discordant with the coast — influence how quickly the coastline changes and which features develop.

## Key coastal landforms and their examples
Cliffs, caves, arches and stacks are the classic erosion sequence on a rocky coastline. Waves exploit weaknesses and joints to form caves; where a cave deepens and a weakness extends through a headland, an arch can develop; when an arch collapses under continued erosion, it leaves an isolated pillar of rock known as a stack. Headlands and bays form where bands of rock of differing resistance lie parallel to the coast: softer rocks erode more quickly producing bays with sheltered beaches, while harder rocks remain as protruding headlands exposed to wave attack. Spits and sand bars are depositional landforms created by longshore drift where sediment is deposited across a bay or estuary mouth; a spit is a narrow finger of sand or shingle that extends from the shoreline and may show recurved ends where changes in wind or wave direction occur. A well-known UK example of a spit is Spurn Head on the Humber estuary, while Chesil Beach in Dorset is an important example of a shingle bar that links land and shapes coastal hydrodynamics. Examples of stacks and arches can be seen along the Jurassic Coast and at Old Harry Rocks near Studland in Dorset; dramatic cliffs and headlands are visible at Flamborough Head and along parts of Scotland’s coastline such as the Kintyre and Caithness coasts.

## Human uses of upland and coastal landscapes and resulting conflicts
Both upland and coastal areas support multiple land uses that can sometimes conflict. Upland areas are used for sheep and cattle grazing, commercial forestry, water storage for reservoirs and hydroelectric schemes, renewable energy such as wind farms, industry in more accessible valleys, and recreation and tourism — walking, climbing and winter sports. Coastal zones host ports and harbours, tourist resorts, residential development, defence infrastructure, and energy installations including offshore wind farms. Conflicts arise when one use damages another: tourism can bring income but also footpath erosion, litter and pressure on fragile habitats; forestry or large-scale renewable projects may change the visual character of upland regions and conflict with conservation targets and local residents; coastal defences built to protect towns can starve down-drift beaches of sediment, increasing erosion elsewhere. Economic priorities, environmental protection, and community interests must be balanced, and that balance is at the heart of many management debates.

## Managing landscapes: strategies, trade-offs and sustainable options
There are a range of solutions to manage land use conflicts and protect both upland and coastal environments, often involving trade-offs. In upland areas, planning controls, national park designations and conservation management can protect landscapes while supporting sustainable tourism through path maintenance and visitor education. Rewilding and targeted forestry can improve biodiversity and reduce flood risk downstream, but may change grazing patterns and local livelihoods. For coasts, engineering responses range from hard defences, such as sea walls and rock armour, to soft engineering, like beach nourishment and managed realignment. Hard defences give immediate protection to property but are expensive and can transfer the problem elsewhere; soft engineering works with natural processes, is often cheaper in the long run, and can create new habitats, but may require difficult decisions about abandoning some land to the sea. Modern coastal management increasingly involves stakeholder consultation, long-term monitoring, and mapping of areas suitable for managed retreat so that limited resources are used strategy to protect the most valuable human and natural assets.

## Fieldwork, map skills and illustrating answers
Fieldwork and map-reading skills are practical ways to deepen understanding and score well in exams. In upland glaciated landscapes, simple fieldwork might include measuring valley cross-sections to show U-shaped profiles, locating corries and moraines on maps and photographs, and observing scree deposits and weathering features. In coastal studies, transects along a beach can measure sediment size and beach profile to show how constructive and destructive waves influence deposition; mapping longshore drift markers and examining cliff profiles help demonstrate processes. Being confident with Ordnance Survey map skills — four- and six-figure grid references, interpreting contour patterns to recognise truncated spurs or corrie basins, and using map evidence with photographs — allows you to link theory to real landscapes. Practice drawing and labelling clear, simple diagrams of a corrie, a U-shaped valley with hanging tributary, or the cliff-to-stack erosion sequence; annotated sketches combined with process explanation are quick ways to gain marks.

## Exam technique
When answering questions, start by reading the command word carefully and planning your response. For description questions, lead with a clear definition of the landform or process, then describe its appearance using precise terminology and, where possible, give a named example. For explanation questions, set out the sequence of processes — for example, how plucking and abrasion form a corrie, or how longshore drift and changes in wind direction build a spit — and link each step clearly to the resulting landform. In evaluation or ‘assess’ questions about management, balance advantages and disadvantages, refer to short- and long-term impacts, include economic, social and environmental considerations, and conclude with a justified recommendation. Use case studies to support points: a short named example such as the Cairngorms for corries and arêtes, the Lake District for U-shaped valleys and hanging valleys, Holderness or Spurn Head for rapid coastal erosion and spit dynamics, and Medmerry or managed realignment schemes for coastal management, will show examiners you can apply knowledge to real UK locations. Time management is important: allocate time proportionally to the marks available, make diagrams where they help — labelled sketches can save words and gain marks — and always check your answer links processes to landforms and to human impacts or management where required. Practise past-style questions under timed conditions using OS maps, photographs and data to build confidence and skill in integrating the theory with real-world evidence.
