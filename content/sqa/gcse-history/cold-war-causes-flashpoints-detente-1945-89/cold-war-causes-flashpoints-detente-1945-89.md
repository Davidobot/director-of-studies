# The Cold War: causes, flashpoints and détente (1945–89) (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Origins and nature of the Cold War
The Cold War began in the closing months of the Second World War and was shaped by a mixture of ideology, power politics and mutual mistrust. The Soviet Union, scarred by the devastation of the Nazi invasion, wanted secure borders, friendly governments in Eastern Europe and recognition of its great‑power status. The United States and its Western allies, having fought for a liberal, international order, were suspicious of Soviet one‑party rule and Communist expansion. Differing visions for post‑war Europe were made visible at conferences such as Yalta and Potsdam, where disagreements over Poland, reparations and the fate of Germany surfaced. The development and use of atomic weapons added a terrifying new dimension: both sides could inflict catastrophic damage, so direct war between the superpowers was avoided. Instead, competition took the form of political influence, economic pressure, propaganda, espionage and proxy wars, a pattern that defined international relations from 1945 to 1989.

## Containment, the Marshall Plan and the division of Europe
A clear example of how the West reacted to Soviet behaviour was the United States’ policy of containment. Articulated in different forms, containment aimed to stop further Communist expansion without provoking full‑scale war. The Truman Doctrine announced US support for states resisting Communism, and the Marshall Plan used economic aid to rebuild Western European economies and make them less vulnerable to Communist appeal. In response to growing Western integration and the formation of NATO in 1949, the USSR consolidated control over Eastern Europe and later created the Warsaw Pact. Germany became the most visible symbol of division: the Federal Republic (West Germany) aligned with the West, while the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) remained firmly under Soviet influence. This political, economic and military division entrenched the bipolar world order and set the stage for repeated confrontations.

## Early military confrontations and the role of nuclear weapons
Although the superpowers avoided direct military conflict, the immediate post‑war years saw serious confrontations. The Berlin Blockade of 1948–49 was an early crisis in which the Soviets attempted to force the Western powers out of West Berlin; the Western response, the Berlin Airlift, illustrated how far each side would go to defend its interests short of war. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 showed how regional conflicts could draw in global powers: the United States and its UN allies intervened to stop the spread of Communism into the South, while China and the USSR supported the North. The Korean War hardened attitudes and normalised the idea of proxy warfare. The existence of nuclear arsenals created the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), which paradoxically made direct superpower war less likely but made crises more dangerous. Crises had to be managed carefully because any escalation could become catastrophic.

## Flashpoints: Hungary, Berlin and Cuba
The Cold War produced moments of acute danger. In 1956 Hungarians revolted against Moscow’s domination; the uprising began with demands for political reform and national freedom but was crushed when Soviet tanks entered Budapest. The brutal suppression showed the limits of Western influence behind the Iron Curtain and reinforced the Soviet approach to security in Eastern Europe. Berlin remained a recurring flashpoint. In 1961, confronted by mass emigration from East to West through Berlin, the East German government, supported by the USSR, erected the Berlin Wall. The Wall became a powerful symbol of the Cold War—of division, repression and competing ideologies. The most dangerous crisis came in October 1962 with the Cuban Missile Crisis. When the USSR secretly placed nuclear missiles in Cuba, the United States discovered them and imposed a naval blockade. For thirteen days the world stood on the brink of nuclear war before a negotiated settlement was reached: the Soviets withdrew their missiles from Cuba and the US secretly agreed to remove missiles from Turkey. The crisis demonstrated how close miscalculation could bring about catastrophe, and it prompted both sides to seek better crisis management.

## The long shadow of proxy wars: Vietnam and beyond
From the 1950s through the 1970s, proxy wars were a dominant feature of the Cold War. The Vietnam War stands out for its length, intensity and domestic impact in the United States. US intervention, rooted in the domino theory and the policy of containment, escalated in the 1960s as America sought to prevent a Communist takeover of South Vietnam. The Vietcong and North Vietnamese forces used guerrilla tactics and benefited from support from the Soviet Union and China. The war exposed the limits of American military power in counter‑insurgency, provoked massive anti‑war protests at home, and shifted global opinion. Other conflicts—such as in Angola, Afghanistan (where the Soviet invasion in 1979 led to a US‑backed Afghan resistance) and various civil wars—were shaped by superpower rivalry and local causes. These wars had devastating human and economic costs, and they reinforced the idea that the Cold War was fought most brutally in the developing world.

## Détente, arms control and their limits
By the late 1960s and into the 1970s, both superpowers recognised the economic and strategic costs of endless competition. A period known as détente sought to reduce tensions through negotiation. High‑profile agreements included the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) which limited some categories of nuclear weapons, and the Helsinki Accords, which combined recognition of post‑war borders with commitments to human rights. Détente also brought improved diplomatic relations, trade and cultural exchanges. However, détente had limits. Differences over human rights, continued proxy conflicts, and renewed rivalry in areas like the Third World kept tensions alive. Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979 dealt a severe blow to détente, triggering a new period of hostility in the early 1980s. Meanwhile, domestic politics in both blocs—public opinion, leadership changes and economic pressures—shaped how far détente could go.

## Gorbachev, reform and the end of Cold War confrontation
The final phase of the Cold War was shaped by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who came to power in 1985 and introduced the twin policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). Facing economic stagnation and the unsustainable cost of military competition, Gorbachev sought to reform the Soviet system and reduce confrontation with the West. He negotiated arms control agreements with the United States, most notably the Intermediate‑Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 1987, which eliminated a whole class of missiles. At the same time, his unwillingness to use force to sustain Communist regimes in Eastern Europe opened the way for popular revolutions. 1989 became the pivotal year: peaceful uprisings swept through Eastern Europe and the Berlin Wall fell in November. These events signalled the collapse of Soviet control in the region and the practical end of Cold War division. While the Soviet Union itself did not formally dissolve until 1991, the period from 1989 shows how diplomatic change, economic weakness and popular movements combined to end an era of confrontation.

## The Cold War’s impact and legacy
The Cold War reshaped politics, societies and economies across the globe. It spurred rapid technological and military advances, including the space race, and led to the formation of military alliances and blocs. On the home front, fear of espionage and subversion influenced public life and civil liberties in various countries. Economically, the arms race diverted resources, and the ideological competition affected development strategies and trade relationships. The end of the Cold War did not erase its consequences: the post‑1991 period saw new security challenges, the re‑ordering of international institutions, and debates about how to integrate former communist states into a wider European framework. For students, understanding the Cold War means seeing how ideology and power interact, how international crises were managed, and how domestic politics and economic realities can transform the international system.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the Cold War, read the question carefully to identify exactly what is being asked. For a ‘Describe’ question, focus on clear factual points presented in concise sentences, and develop each fact if possible. For ‘Explain the reasons why…’ questions, structure your response by giving distinct reasons and linking each explicitly to the question—explain how and why each factor contributed. ‘To what extent’ or ‘How successful’ questions require balanced argument: set out at least two reasons supporting the claim and at least one counter‑argument, then reach a clear judgement supported by evidence. When working with sources, begin by identifying what the source actually says and then evaluate its usefulness by considering the author, purpose, timing, content and omissions; remember that a source can be valuable in some ways and limited in others. For comparison questions, compare sources point by point and conclude with an overall judgement about the extent of agreement. For ‘How fully’ context questions, use the source as a starting point and add outside knowledge to show what the source includes and what it omits. Throughout, aim for clarity, use specific examples (Berlin Airlift, Korean War, Cuban Missile Crisis, SALT, 1989 revolutions) to support your points, and conclude with a brief, reasoned judgement that answers the question directly.
