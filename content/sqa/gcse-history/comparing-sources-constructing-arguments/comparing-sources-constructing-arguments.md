# Comparing sources and constructing historical arguments (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Why comparing sources and building arguments matter
At National 5 level you are not simply learning facts; you are learning how to use evidence to make sense of the past. Comparing sources and constructing historical arguments are central to being a historian. When you compare two accounts or evaluate a single source, you show that you can weigh evidence, judge reliability, place material in its context, and reach a balanced conclusion. These skills are assessed in both the question paper and the assignment: the question paper asks you to describe, explain, evaluate and compare sources under timed conditions, while the assignment demands a researched, evidence-based argument. Practising these skills helps you think clearly, write persuasively and show how knowledge and evidence combine to support reasoned conclusions.

## Reading a source carefully: origin, purpose, content and context
Every useful evaluation begins with careful reading. Ask: who produced this source and why? The origin (author, date and type of source) affects what the source can tell you. The purpose—whether to inform, persuade, justify or entertain—often shapes tone and emphasis. The content gives direct evidence: facts, claims, descriptions or explanations. The context—what was happening at the time and the position of the author—helps you judge whether the source is likely to be complete, biased, or limited. For example, a British recruiting poster from 1914 will be strong evidence for showing how propaganda encouraged enlistment, but it cannot tell you directly how many men actually volunteered for reasons of peer pressure or economic incentive. Noticing what a source does not say is as important as noting what it does say.

## Evaluating usefulness: what to say and how to say it
When asked to evaluate the usefulness of a source as evidence for a particular issue, structure your answer so that each point links back to the question. An effective evaluation discusses the author, the type of source, the timing, the purpose and the content, and then draws a judgement about usefulness. For example, when assessing a short diary entry about the Battle of Bannockburn, note that a contemporary personal diary may offer vivid first-hand detail (strength), but the writer’s limited perspective and possible exaggeration reduce overall usefulness for explaining national strategy (limitation). A balance of positive and negative comments with reasons and an overall judgement is key. Make sure to use your own knowledge to identify significant omissions: what the source does not mention that you know is important. This demonstrates that you can combine source analysis with factual knowledge to reach a judgement.

## Comparing sources: techniques for clear, direct comparison
Comparing sources goes beyond saying they agree or disagree; you must compare content point by point and use provenance to interpret differences. Start by identifying clear points made in each source. If two newspaper reports disagree about the causes of the 1707 Treaty of Union, for instance, compare how each explains economic motives, political pressure, or national identity. Move from simple points of similarity or difference to developed comparisons that explain why the differences exist. Consider the authors’ backgrounds, intended audiences and the moment each source was produced. A Scottish pamphlet written during the 1706 debates will have different aims and tone from an English merchant’s letter written after the Treaty. Use direct comparisons (this source says X, while that source says Y) and then explain the implications for which source you trust more for particular aspects of the issue.

## Contextualisation and the importance of omission
Contextualisation asks you to place a source within its wider historical setting and judge how fully it represents an event or explains causes. When you are asked “How fully does Source X explain…?” you should make a judgement about completeness. For example, a government report on poor housing in Victorian towns may describe overcrowding and disease, but it might omit causes such as industrial migration or inadequate sanitation policies. Pointing out these omissions shows that you understand the limits of a single source. In exam answers, support your judgement with specific additional knowledge. Good contextualisation is not merely background narrative; it directly tests the source’s coverage against what you know to be important.

## Constructing a historical argument: using knowledge and evidence together
A strong historical argument links evidence from sources with your own knowledge to explain and evaluate. Begin with a clear, focused introduction that answers the question and outlines your approach. In the body of your essay or assignment, present at least two well-developed factors or lines of evidence. For each factor, use the sources to provide contemporary or interpreted evidence and then bring in factual knowledge to expand, test or qualify that evidence. For instance, if answering “To what extent was propaganda the main reason Scots volunteered in 1914?” you would examine a recruiting poster (source evidence), explain how it worked in daily life (contextual knowledge), weigh other factors such as patriotism and the pals battalions (additional evidence and knowledge), and then evaluate the relative importance of each factor. Always end with a reasoned conclusion that revisits your opening judgement and explains why one interpretation is stronger, acknowledging any remaining uncertainties.

## The assignment: research, resource sheet and independence
The National 5 assignment is your chance to research an historical question, gather evidence and present an argument. You have an open choice of question and a notional eight hours for the research stage during the course, followed by one hour, in supervised conditions, to produce the final piece of evidence. During research you should collect material from at least two sources, note references and begin to shape your argument. The History Resource Sheet, a single side of A4 with no more than 200 words, must accompany your submission; it is not assessed directly but failure to include it costs four marks. During research you may receive reasonable assistance: help choosing a topic, advice about likely sources, and interim checks. You must not be given the question or directed to specific resources, and the final production hour must be completed independently under high supervision. The assignment is assessed on stages that include introducing a question, referencing, deploying knowledge, analysing and evaluating factors, organising material, supporting a conclusion and reaching a reasoned judgement, so plan your work to show all of these skills.

## Building clarity and precision in writing
Clarity matters as much as accuracy. Answers that are well signposted are easier to mark and score higher. In timed exams use short, focused paragraphs, each with a clear topic sentence that links back to the question. When you use sources, quote or summarise briefly and follow immediately with analysis: say why the point matters and whether it is reliable. For essays, an introduction should set out your judgement and the main factors you will discuss, and the conclusion should explain why your judgement follows from the evidence. In the assignment, keep your Resource Sheet tight and accurate: treat it as a practical aide-mémoire that summarises your sources and references, and ensures you use evidence, not assertion, in the production hour. Avoid overlong narrative that does not directly address the question; examiners reward focused analysis and evaluation.

## Exam technique
Begin every exam question by reading the question carefully and underlining the key command words: describe, explain, compare, evaluate, to what extent, or how fully. For a Describe question make clear factual points and, where possible, develop one or two of them. For Explain questions give reasons and link each reason explicitly to the question; do not simply narrate. For To what extent/How important/How successful questions treat the task like a short essay: open with a clear judgement, give at least two balanced factors with supporting knowledge, then reach a reasoned conclusion that explains the relative weight of those factors. For Evaluate the usefulness of a source, discuss provenance (author, purpose, timing), content and omissions, and end with an overall judgement about usefulness for the specific question. For Compare questions align content points directly and explain differences using provenance; avoid listing separate analyses—compare point by point. For How fully questions make a clear judgement about the scope of the source and use your own knowledge to identify significant omissions that matter for the question. Manage your time: plan brief outlines for longer answers, allocate minutes per question in proportion to marks, and leave a couple of minutes to check and polish key sentences. In the assignment remember the rules about research and production: use your research time to assemble clear evidence and a short Resource Sheet, then use the one-hour supervised sitting to write a focused, structured argument with evaluation and a supported conclusion. Finally, always link every point back to the question: relevance distinguishes a good answer from a great one.
