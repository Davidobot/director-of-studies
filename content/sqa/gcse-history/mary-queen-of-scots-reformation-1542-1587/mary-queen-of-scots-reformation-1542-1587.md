# Mary Queen of Scots & the Reformation (1542–1587) (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview and themes
The period 1542–1587 in Scotland is dominated by the twin dramas of a young Catholic queen whose life intersected with European dynastic politics and a powerful Protestant Reformation that transformed Scottish society. This chapter explores the causes and consequences of religious change, the struggles over royal authority, and the role of powerful nobles. The main themes to follow are monarchy, church and authority: how a monarch tried to govern a country whose religious and political landscape was shifting; how the Scottish Kirk developed its own identity, often in opposition to royal power; and how competing noble factions used religion and marriage to pursue influence. Understanding these themes helps explain why Mary Stuart’s personal choices—her marriages, her courtiers, her alliances—had such large political consequences.

## Scotland in 1542–1559: dynastic crisis and French connections
Mary was born in December 1542 and became queen when her father James V died shortly after her birth. Scotland was immediately vulnerable. A minority ruler invited regents and foreign influence. England sought to force a dynastic settlement by marrying the infant Mary to Edward VI; the series of aggressive military raids known as the ‘Rough Wooing’ (1543–1550) aimed to make Scotland accept an English marriage. Instead, many Scots turned to France and the Auld Alliance for protection. Mary was taken to France in 1548 and raised at the French court, where she married the Dauphin and became Queen Consort of France in 1558. Meanwhile, in Scotland the Catholic establishment, led by figures such as Mary of Guise (Mary’s mother), tried to maintain royal authority and preserve Catholicism. The political and social structures of mid-16th-century Scotland—powerful noble families, influential burghs and an established clergy—meant that any lasting change would have to involve the nobility and towns as well as the monarchy.

## The Scottish Reformation, 1559–1560
Religious reform in Scotland had its own pattern and pace. Protestant ideas arrived gradually and were given a distinct Scottish voice by preachers such as George Wishart and John Knox. The preaching of Knox, influenced by Calvinism, was energetic and polemical, and discontent with the morality and wealth of some clergy aided the spread of Protestantism. Opposition to the regency of Mary of Guise combined religious and political grievance. A group of Protestant nobles, the Lords of the Congregation, led a rebellion in 1559; their cause attracted English support, not out of religious zeal alone but because England wished to limit French influence. The conflict ended with the Treaty of Edinburgh in 1560, which led to the withdrawal of French troops and effectively ended French domination. In the same year the Scottish Parliament accepted a Protestant confession, abolished papal authority and began the process of dismantling the old ecclesiastical structures. These measures were more a political settlement than a unanimous religious conversion: many Scots remained Catholic in sympathy, and implementation varied across the country. Nonetheless, by 1560 the institutional basis for a reformed Scottish Kirk had been laid.

## Mary’s return and reign in Scotland, 1561–1567
Mary returned to Scotland in 1561 as a young widow after the death of her French husband, Francis II. She arrived determined to assert her monarchical dignity and to secure her inheritance, but she faced a kingdom that had moved decisively toward Protestantism in her absence. Mary’s personal qualities—her intelligence, courtly sophistication and Catholic faith—were both assets and liabilities. She tried to follow a policy of conciliation, keeping some Protestant advisers while practising her Catholic faith privately. Problems emerged from court culture and family politics. Her marriage in 1565 to her cousin Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was politically fraught. Darnley’s behaviour alienated the nobility; the murder of Mary’s private secretary David Rizzio in 1566, carried out by nobles with Darnley’s involvement, exposed divisions at court. In February 1567 Darnley himself was murdered in suspicious circumstances at Kirk o’Field. James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, was widely suspected of involvement. The rapid sequence that followed—Mary’s controversial marriage to Bothwell in May 1567 and the subsequent uprisings of the nobles—destroyed her support. A coalition of nobles forced her to abdicate in favour of her infant son, James VI, in July 1567. Mary escaped captivity briefly but was defeated at the Battle of Langside in May 1568 and fled to England, seeking protection from her cousin Elizabeth I.

## Regents, the Kirk and the struggle over authority
After Mary’s abdication the governance of Scotland passed to a succession of regents who ruled in the name of the young James VI. The most important regents, including James Stewart, Earl of Moray, and later the Regent Morton, were Protestant and worked to consolidate the Reformation settlement while stabilising royal government. The regents had to balance noble interests, the demands of the reformed clergy and the fragile economy. Religious settlement advanced through the 1570s: the Kirk developed a Presbyterian structure with a system of kirk sessions and presbyteries, and figures such as Andrew Melville promoted the idea that church courts had jurisdiction independent of the crown. This challenged traditional monarchical control and led to friction. In the early 1580s a reaction against the perceived dominance of the nobility and the Kirk culminated in legislation like the so-called Black Acts (1584), which attempted to strengthen royal authority and restore bishops. These laws provoked opposition from strong Presbyterian leaders and contributed to continued factional rivalry. The regent governments also had to contend with foreign policy pressures, particularly from England, and the competing agendas of powerful magnates who often treated the crown as one player among others.

## Mary in England, plots and execution, 1568–1587
Mary’s arrival in England created a long-term diplomatic dilemma for Elizabeth I. Mary had a strong claim to the English throne as the granddaughter of Margaret Tudor and represented a focal point for English Catholics and foreign powers. For Elizabeth, keeping Mary alive risked encouraging Catholic plots; executing her risked provoking Catholic Europe. Over nearly two decades Mary was held in increasing isolation under house arrest. During that time she was implicated, rightly or wrongly, in several conspiracies that aimed to restore Catholic power or to replace Elizabeth. The Ridolfi plot of 1571 envisaged Spanish support for an invasion and Mary’s marriage to the Duke of Norfolk. Later the Throckmorton and Babington plots revealed extensive Catholic networks and foreign involvement. The Babington plot of 1586 directly implicated Mary in correspondence that discussed assassination plans for Elizabeth and an invasion to place Mary on the English throne. Evidence from these conspiracies provided the basis for Mary’s trial. She was tried for treason, found guilty by a special commission, and executed at Fotheringhay Castle on 8 February 1587. Her execution altered the international balance: it hardened the enmity of Catholic powers, contributed to the justification for the Spanish Armada in 1588, and removed the most plausible Catholic alternative to Elizabeth’s rule.

## Legacy and significance
Mary’s life and death have been interpreted in many ways: as a tragic figure overwhelmed by forces beyond her control; as a scheming conspirator; as a symbol of Catholic martyrdom; or as a cautionary example of how personal choices can have national consequences. What is clear is that the period consolidated Protestantism in Scotland and weakened the role of the crown as an uncontested centre of authority. The regency era and the rise of the Kirk established institutions and ideas—especially Presbyterianism—that survived and shaped Scottish governance. Mary's son, James VI, eventually became king of England in 1603, uniting the crowns and bringing a Stuart succession to England; this outcome owed something to the dynastic claims that Mary embodied, even as her personal ambitions failed. For Scotland, the Reformation changed worship, education and politics; for England, the presence and execution of Mary increased tensions with Catholic Europe. In coming to terms with Mary’s place in history, students should weigh short-term political mistakes alongside long-term structural forces: the power of nobles, the influence of ideas like Calvinism, international rivalries between England, France and Spain, and the limits of monarchical authority in a fractured polity.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Mary Queen of Scots and the Reformation, begin by identifying exactly what the question asks: are you asked to describe, explain reasons, assess how far, evaluate a source’s usefulness, compare sources, or place a source in context? For describe questions offer clear, factual points with short elaboration where helpful. For explain questions give reasons linked directly to the question; each paragraph should open with a reason and then use specific evidence or an example—for instance, explain how Bothwell’s reputation or Darnley’s behaviour weakened Mary’s authority. For ‘to what extent’ or ‘how successful’ questions plan a balanced response with at least two clear factors, assess their relative importance and finish with a judgement that answers the question directly. When evaluating sources, comment on author, date, purpose, tone and content, and identify what the source leaves out; use your contextual knowledge to show strengths and weaknesses. For comparison questions, compare point by point: agree or disagree, and then reach an overall judgement about the difference in perspective or emphasis. Time management is crucial: in a two-hour exam spend an appropriate amount of time on each section, leaving time to plan and to write a concise conclusion. Always link facts back to the question; recall specific names and dates to strengthen answers (for example, Treaty of Edinburgh 1560, Mary’s return 1561, Darnley’s murder 1567, Langside 1568, execution 1587). Practice planning short essays under timed conditions, practice source evaluation using the same approach, and learn key quotations or concise summaries of events to use as evidence. Finally, show depth by explaining consequences and connections: how the Reformation affected government, how Mary’s marriages altered noble alliances, and how her fate influenced Anglo‑European politics.
