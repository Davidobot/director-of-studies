# Treaty of Union and its impact (1689–1715) (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## The background: Scotland and England after 1689
The period after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89 left Scotland and England bound by the same monarch but often at odds over policy, religion and trade. William and Mary ruled both kingdoms, but the Union of the Crowns (1603) had not produced a political union of Parliaments; Scotland still had its own Parliament, church and law. Relations grew strained in the closing years of the seventeenth century. England’s growing commercial strength, its Navigation Acts and involvement in European wars meant it sought to control trade in ways that disadvantaged Scottish merchants. Meanwhile Scotland faced poor harvests, economic weakness and political anxieties about the succession to the crown once Queen Anne left no surviving heir. These strains set the scene for the negotiations and controversies that led to the Treaty of Union in 1707.

## Economic crisis and the Darien disaster
A central immediate cause of the move towards union was Scotland’s desperate need to improve its economy. In the 1690s Scotland suffered bad harvests and trade difficulties; many landowners and burghs saw their incomes fall. The Darien scheme — an ambitious attempt by the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies to found a colony on the Isthmus of Panama (1698–1700) — collapsed disastrously. Thousands of Scots invested savings and charters; disease, poor planning and hostile Spanish forces ruined the colony and left the company bankrupt. The financial shock heightened the feeling that Scottish prosperity required access to larger markets and colonial trade. English commercial law, especially the Navigation Acts, limited Scots’ trading opportunities with English colonies. The economic fallout from Darien was therefore a powerful argument used by pro-Union politicians who claimed that union with England would open markets and bring stability.

## Succession and political pressure: Act of Security and the Alien Act
Political manoeuvring over the succession after Queen Anne intensified relations between the two parliaments. England had settled the Protestant succession with the Act of Settlement (1701), which named the Hanoverian line as heirs. Scotland, anxious to protect its own interests, passed the Act of Security in 1704 giving the Scottish Parliament the right to choose a different successor unless its concerns were addressed. England responded with pressure. The Alien Act of 1705 was a coercive measure passed by the English Parliament: it threatened to treat Scots as aliens, to impose trade restrictions and to block the inheritance rights of Scots in England unless Scotland negotiated on succession or repealed the Act of Security. Faced with the prospect of severe economic sanctions and political isolation, Scottish leaders were pushed towards negotiation. At the same time, both crowns appointed commissioners to discuss a wider political union, beginning formal negotiations in 1706.

## Arguments, parties and public reaction in Scotland
The debate inside Scotland was fierce and divided. Supporters of union argued that it would remedy the economic crisis, provide access to colonial trade, guarantee a secure Protestant succession and bring peace between the two kingdoms. Key pro-Union figures included members of the Court party who favoured close ties with London; the Duke of Queensberry played a leading role in steering the Treaty through the Scottish Parliament. Opponents stressed the loss of Scottish independence, the closure of the Scottish Parliament, and the danger of English domination. Influential critics like Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun attacked the idea as a surrender of national identity and liberties. Between these positions stood the Squadrone Volante, a group of independent members who could swing votes and whose support proved decisive.

Public feeling was largely hostile to the idea of surrendering the Scottish Parliament. Riots and demonstrations took place in Edinburgh and other towns; pamphlets and sermons denounced the negotiations as a betrayal. Rumours of bribery and corruption circulated: many contemporaries believed that some MPs had been paid or promised rewards to support the Treaty. This sense of grievance fed a lasting narrative that union had been achieved by the purchase of a “parcel of rogues”, a phrase that later nationalists would turn into cultural memory.

## Negotiation and the main terms of the Treaty
Negotiations produced the Acts of Union passed by the English and Scottish Parliaments in 1707. The Treaty contained several important political, economic and legal provisions. Politically, the two kingdoms were to become one kingdom of Great Britain with a single Parliament at Westminster; the Scottish Parliament was dissolved and Scotland was to be represented by 45 Members of Parliament in the House of Commons and by 16 representative peers in the House of Lords. Economically, Scotland was to join England in a customs and commercial union, with access to English colonial trade; to compensate Scotland for taking on part of England’s public obligations, an agreed sum — known as the Equivalent — of about £400,000 was paid to Scotland. This payment also helped to compensate investors who had lost money in Darien. Religiously, the Treaty protected the Church of Scotland (Presbyterianism), guaranteeing its continued governance and worship. Legally, Scotland retained its separate legal system and institutions, and its established courts. Education and the legal traditions were preserved, which meant Scots kept a distinct legal identity within the new state.

These terms were compromises. Politically, while Scotland gained representation at Westminster, the numbers were small compared with English MPs and many Scots felt under-represented. The guarantees for the Church and law were important protections that eased some fears, but they did not remove popular resentment about the loss of an independent Parliament.

## Immediate impacts in Scotland to 1715: economy, society and politics
The immediate impact of the Union was mixed. Economically, the short-term effects were limited; some hoped-for commercial boons took time to materialise. Scottish merchants gradually gained access to English markets and, crucially, to the expanding British colonial economy. Over the next decades this would benefit Scotland’s ports and some industries, but change was not instantaneous and many people in the early years felt no immediate improvement. The Equivalent provided welcome funds to a bankrupt aristocracy and mercantile class, and it helped stabilise public finances for a few influential figures.

Politically, the abolition of the Scottish Parliament created a sense of loss and grievance among many Scots, especially those who had opposed the Treaty. The transfer of sovereignty was deeply controversial and fuelled Jacobite sentiment among those who already preferred the Stuart claim to the throne. The religious settlement in the Treaty reassured many Presbyterians that the Kirk would be secure, but disputes over patronage and church governance were not entirely resolved and would continue to cause friction. Socially, resentment took the form of enduring cultural memory and protest literature; emigratory movements increased in later years as Scots sought opportunity abroad.

## The Union and the Jacobite rising of 1715
The death of Queen Anne in 1714 and the succession of George I — the Hanoverian king named by the English Act of Settlement — brought the issue of legitimacy to the fore. Many Jacobites, supporters of the exiled Stuart family, saw the Union as part of a plot to marginalise and dispossess Scotland and to impose a foreign dynasty. The 1715 rising, led by the Earl of Mar, combined dynastic politics with opposition to the Union and local grievances. The Jacobite cause attracted support from Highland chiefs and from disaffected Lowland Tories who resented the new political order. The rising aimed to place James Francis Edward Stuart, the “Old Pretender”, on the British throne. Although the 1715 rebellion ultimately failed, its causes were entwined with the resentments produced by the Union: real fears of loss of national autonomy, perceived injustices in the way the Treaty was passed, and ongoing economic hardship among many classes. The government’s suppression of the rising and the consolidation of Hanoverian rule strengthened the new British state, but the rising confirmed that the Union had unsettled large sections of Scottish society.

## Longer-term significance and how to judge the Union by 1715
By 1715 the Union had produced a complex legacy. On one level, it was an accomplished political project that answered immediate questions about succession and removed the threat of English sanctions. It secured Protestant succession and tied Scotland into a larger commercial framework that would yield future economic opportunities. On another level, it created deep political and cultural wounds. The sense of betrayal and the memory of corruption contributed to continuing instability, as shown by the Jacobite risings. Many of the social and economic benefits of union took longer than a decade to materialise, so contemporary evaluation was often negative among the poor, the dispossessed and those who valued parliamentary independence. Teachers and students should therefore judge the Union by balancing short-term consequences — political subordination felt by many, ongoing economic hardship, cultural anger — against longer-term possibilities: access to empire, the stabilisation of the Protestant succession, and the eventual growth of trade and industry that would transform parts of Scotland in the eighteenth century.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on the Treaty of Union and its impact, begin by analysing precisely what the question asks — for example, whether it asks about causes, effects, or the extent of its success. Use key facts to structure answers: refer to dates such as the Darien failures (1698–1700), the Act of Security (1704), the Alien Act (1705), the negotiations (1706–07), the Acts of Union (1707) and the Jacobite rising (1715). For “explain” and “describe” questions give clear factual points supported by brief explanation. For “how far” or “to what extent” essays use a balanced structure with at least two developed factors on each side and finish with a judgement that weighs the evidence. In source-based questions evaluate usefulness by considering origin, purpose, content and significant omissions, and always back your evaluation with specific contextual knowledge (for example, how the Darien disaster explains the economic urgency behind the push for union). For comparison questions make direct point-by-point comparisons and then offer an overall conclusion. Time management is vital: plan a short introduction, develop your argument in focused paragraphs, and reserve time for a clear conclusion. Finally, learn a few strong examples and names — Darien, the Equivalent, Queensberry, Andrew Fletcher, Squadrone Volante, 45 MPs and 16 peers, and the 1715 rising — as these will strengthen explanations and show secure knowledge.
