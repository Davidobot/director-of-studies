# Hitler and Nazi Germany (1919–39) (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## From the collapse of empire to Weimar democracy, 1919–23
Germany in 1919 was a country in shock. The defeat of the First World War and the abdication of the Kaiser left a political vacuum and a society scarred by loss, food shortages and political violence. The Weimar Republic, established in 1919, attempted to create a democratic constitution with proportional representation, a powerful president and civil liberties. It faced immediate problems. The Treaty of Versailles imposed heavy territorial losses, military restrictions and reparations that many Germans regarded as humiliating. Economically, the burden of reparations and disruption after the war fed inflation and social hardship. Politically the new democracy was fragile: left-wing Spartacist uprisings and right-wing paramilitary activity, such as the Freikorps, created a climate of unrest. From the outset, many conservative nationalists, monarchists and ex-servicemen viewed Weimar as an unwanted experiment imposed by defeat, not an expression of German political will.

## Crisis and recovery: hyperinflation, the Ruhr and the 1920s
The early 1920s showed how fragile the new system was. In 1923 French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr to force reparations payments; German passive resistance and the government’s decision to print money led to hyperinflation that wiped out savings and pensions. These economic shocks fuelled extremism and discredited moderate democratic parties. At the same time, political violence continued: the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 was an early Nazi attempt to seize power in Munich and demonstrated both the volatility of the era and the personality of Adolf Hitler as a courtroom showman after his trial. Recovery began when Gustav Stresemann became chancellor and foreign minister; his policies stabilised the currency with the Rentenmark and secured the Dawes Plan in 1924, which restructured reparations and opened the way to foreign loans. The mid-to-late 1920s brought relative stabilisation and a cultural flowering in cities, yet the underlying social tensions and resentment over Versailles remained.

## The impact of the Great Depression and the Nazi rise, 1929–33
The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the global Depression hit Germany especially hard. American loans dried up, industry collapsed and unemployment soared. The economic emergency undermined the remaining confidence in Weimar’s parliamentary politics and intensified support for extremist parties. The Nazi Party combined mass organisation, disciplined local branches, paramilitary Sturmabteilung (SA), and highly effective propaganda under Joseph Goebbels. Hitler’s message mixed nationalist grievance, anti-communism, promises to restore order and employment, and the scapegoating of Jews and other minorities. Crucially, conservative elites and industrialists began to see Hitler as an instrument to block socialist revolution and to restore order, believing he could be controlled. In elections between 1930 and early 1933 the Nazis became the largest party in the Reichstag, but they did not initially hold an outright majority. The interplay of street politics, electoral success and backroom deals culminated in Hitler being appointed chancellor in January 1933.

## From chancellor to dictator: consolidation of power, 1933–34
Once in office, the Nazis moved quickly to transform a legal minority government into a totalitarian one. The Reichstag Fire in February 1933 provided a pretext to suspend civil liberties and to arrest Communists. The Reichstag Fire Decree removed key constitutional protections and the Enabling Act in March 1933 gave Hitler’s cabinet the power to make laws without parliamentary consent. Under the policy of Gleichschaltung the Nazis brought state governments, trade unions, political parties and cultural organisations under central control. Independent newspapers were closed, opponents were imprisoned in early concentration camps, and political parties were banned or dissolved. The Night of the Long Knives in June 1934 removed internal rivals and reassured the army and conservative elites by eliminating the SA leadership and other critics. When President Hindenburg died in August 1934, Hitler merged the offices of president and chancellor and secured the army’s oath of personal loyalty, firmly establishing his dictatorship.

## The machinery of control: policing, propaganda and culture
The Nazi regime combined terror and persuasion to control German life. The Gestapo and the criminal police operated without judicial restraint, monitoring and arresting suspected opponents. The SS became a powerful organisation with its own ideology and concentration camp system, while the regular police and courts increasingly served the state. Propaganda, led by Goebbels, aimed to create a unified Volksgemeinschaft, or people’s community. Radio broadcasts, mass rallies such as the Nuremberg rallies, films, posters and controlled press presented Hitler as Germany’s saviour and normalised Nazi ideology. Culture was regimented through bodies such as the Reich Chamber of Culture: art and literature that did not conform with Nazi aesthetics were denounced as “degenerate” and removed from public life. Education and youth organisations were central to long-term control. School curricula were rewritten to emphasise racial theory, military virtues and loyalty, while the Hitler Youth and League of German Girls sought to socialise whole generations into party values.

## Society, women and youth under Nazism
Nazi social policy sought to remake everyday life in line with ideological priorities. The regime promoted a conservative gender role for women: the ideal of “Kinder, Küche, Kirche” (children, kitchen, church) encouraged marriage and childbearing. The Law for the Encouragement of Marriage provided loans to newlyweds, which were gradually written off as wives left paid work to have children. At the same time, economic needs and later rearmament prompted increased female employment in certain sectors. For young people, the Hitler Youth became almost unavoidable: membership offered leisure and training but also inculcated militarism and obedience. Youth dissent existed, however; groups such as the Swing Youth and the Edelweiss Pirates demonstrated cultural resistance and, in some cases, open defiance. Churches, both Protestant and Catholic, initially offered varying degrees of accommodation and opposition; the regime negotiated and then increasingly intruded on religious life, seeking to subordinate churches to state power.

## Economy, rearmament and living standards
Economically, the Nazis inherited a shattered economy and pursued policies designed to reduce unemployment and rebuild national confidence. Public works projects, such as the construction of motorways, and creative accounting, including conscription and rearmament, rapidly brought down unemployment figures. The Ministry of Economics under Schacht and later the Four Year Plan under Göring emphasised rearmament and autarky, even if full economic self-sufficiency remained unattainable. Living standards for many Germans improved in the short term as wages stabilised and consumerism was encouraged through organisations like “Strength Through Joy”, yet these gains came at a cost. The rearmament drive prioritised military production over consumer goods, curtailed trade unions, and used forced labour for economic projects. Economic success helped legitimize the regime to many citizens, but it also bound the economy and society to a militaristic and expansionist foreign policy.

## Racial policy, anti-Semitism and persecution to 1939
Racial ideas were central to Nazi ideology and became state policy. Anti-Semitism, already present in German society in various forms, was transformed into systematic exclusion and persecution. Initial measures in 1933 included boycotts of Jewish shops and dismissal of Jewish civil servants. The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 stripped Jews of citizenship and forbade marriage or sexual relations with “Aryans”, institutionalising racial discrimination. Persecution intensified socially and economically, and emigration became the only option for many. The violent escalation of state-sponsored anti-Jewish action reached a turning point with Kristallnacht in November 1938, when synagogues and Jewish businesses were attacked and thousands arrested. While mass murder was not yet policy in the 1930s on German soil, the pattern of exclusion, dispossession and violence created an environment in which increasingly radical measures could be taken once war began. Other groups—Roma, people with disabilities, political dissidents, homosexuals and Jehovah’s Witnesses—also suffered repression and, in some cases, forced sterilisation or internment under eugenic and political rationales.

## Foreign policy and the road to war, 1933–39
Nazi foreign policy aimed to overturn the post‑1918 settlement and rebuild German power. It combined revisionism, the pursuit of Lebensraum (living space), anti‑communism and a willingness to use force. From 1933 the regime withdrew from the League of Nations and began rearmament in secret and then openly. Key steps in the breakdown of Europe’s order came in stages: reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936 challenged Versailles without decisive Western action; support for Franco in the Spanish Civil War provided a testing ground for troops and matériel; Anschluss with Austria in 1938 and the crisis over the Sudetenland culminated in the Munich Agreement, where Britain and France conceded to Hitler’s demands in hopes of securing “peace for our time.” The policy of appeasement followed by the occupiers’ increasing boldness emboldened Nazi ambitions. By 1939 Germany had formed the Pact of Steel with Italy and the Nazi‑Soviet Pact with the USSR to secure temporary non‑aggression and leave Poland vulnerable; the invasion of Poland in September 1939 finally triggered Britain and France to declare war.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Hitler and Nazi Germany, use clear, focused paragraphs that directly address the question. For a “describe” question, give specific factual points with dates and examples—describe the Enabling Act, the Nuremberg Laws, or the reoccupation of the Rhineland briefly but precisely. For “explain” questions, link causes to consequences and show how factors interact; for example, explain how the Great Depression undermined Weimar legitimacy and increased support for the Nazis by citing unemployment figures, electoral gains and examples of Nazi promises. For “to what extent” or short essay questions, present at least two clear factors, develop each with evidence, and then weigh them in a conclusion that judges their relative importance. When using sources, always consider author, purpose, content, timing and omissions: identify the source’s viewpoint, check when it was created, and use your own knowledge to judge what it leaves out. In source comparison questions make point-by-point links between the sources before giving an overall judgement on their agreement or disagreement. For “how fully” or usefulness questions, combine evidence drawn from the source with your wider knowledge to assess completeness and reliability. Always support your points with specific names, dates and events—Stresemann, Reichstag Fire, Night of the Long Knives, Kristallnacht and Munich are useful anchors—and finish essays with a short, explicit conclusion that answers the question. For the coursework assignment, choose a narrowly focused question you can cover well in the time allowed, collect at least two relevant sources during research, prepare a concise History Resource Sheet within the word limit, and plan your one‑hour written response so that you present organised evidence, analyse factors and reach a reasoned conclusion.
