# Migration, Empire and Scots abroad (1830–1939) (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: migration patterns, empire and the Scottish experience
Between the 1830s and the eve of the Second World War, Scotland was shaped by large movements of people in two directions. Immigrants came into Scotland from Ireland and continental Europe, while thousands of Scots left for the wider British Empire and beyond. These flows were driven by economic change, political pressures and the opportunities created by empire. Industrial cities such as Glasgow, Dundee and Edinburgh expanded rapidly, drawing in labour; at the same time the global reach of Britain—and the networks Scots built within it—offered places to settle, trade and make careers abroad. Understanding this period means looking at push and pull factors, the everyday experiences of migrants, the institutions that organized movement, and the impact migration had on communities and Scottish identity.

## Why people moved: push and pull factors, 1830s–1930s
Migration was rarely caused by a single factor. For those leaving Scotland, push factors included rural poverty, agricultural change and the trauma of the Highland Clearances, where many tenants were evicted or forced into new kinds of farming that reduced work. Overpopulation in small farming communities, periodic crop failures and limited local industry also pushed people to consider leaving. Pull factors were powerful: the promise of cheap land in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, advertised opportunities in the United States, and careers in the expanding administration, railways, mining and commercial sectors of the British Empire. Emigration societies, shipping lines and government-assisted schemes made passage more affordable and helped recruit emigrants.

Immigration into Scotland was influenced by both international events and local needs. Irish migration was tied to famine and economic crisis in Ireland, but also to ongoing labour demand in Scottish industries. Eastern European Jews, fleeing persecution and pogroms, arrived from the 1880s onwards and settled in urban centres. Lithuanians came mainly to work in mining and heavy industry, while Italians often found opportunities in catering, ice-cream and fish-and-chip trades. Empire created additional migration routes: Scots’ connections to imperial commerce and administration brought people from parts of the empire to Scottish ports and workplaces.

## Immigration to Scotland: groups, settlement and employers’ needs
Different immigrant groups followed different routes and patterns of settlement. The Irish tended to arrive in large numbers during the mid-nineteenth century and settled in the growing industrial towns, especially around Glasgow. Many found work in docks, building, shipyards and low-paid factory jobs. Eastern European Jewish migrants clustered in some urban districts where they set up tailoring workshops, small shops and community institutions. Italians often settled in particular streets or neighbourhoods and became associated with cafés, ice-cream parlours and small businesses, while Lithuanians were more likely to be found in mining towns or heavy industry centres.

Patterns of settlement reflected employment opportunities and networks. Chain migration—where established migrants helped relatives or neighbours to follow—meant that particular streets or parts of a city could take on a distinct ethnic character. Industrial employers sometimes looked to immigrant labour to fill dangerous or low-paid jobs, and the seasonal or temporary nature of some industries also shaped where migrants lived and how they integrated.

## Experience of immigrants in Scotland: work, housing and relations
The everyday experience of immigrants involved hard work, cramped housing and frequent changes in employment. Overcrowded tenements, poor sanitation and disease were common problems in rapidly expanding urban areas. In work, many immigrants faced long hours, low pay and dangerous conditions, whether in shipyards, factories, mines or the informal economy. Cultural and religious difference played a major role in shaping immigrant community life. For example, the Irish Catholic community often organised around the church, while Jewish migrants established synagogues, schools and mutual aid societies.

Relations between immigrants and the established Scottish population were complex. Stereotypes and hostility existed, particularly during economic downturns when competition for jobs intensified. Sectarian tension, especially in Glasgow, was a continuing problem and could be a source of political mobilisation and social division. At the same time there were many examples of integration, inter-marriage and shared urban culture, and immigrants contributed significantly to the economic life of towns and cities, renewing neighbourhoods and starting businesses that served wider populations.

## Scottish emigration: organized schemes, motives and destinations
Emigration from Scotland took many forms. Some migrants left independently; others travelled under the guidance of emigration societies and government-assisted programmes which aimed to relieve overcrowded districts or to supply labour to colonies. The Highland and Island Clearances, economic distress and the attraction of land for smallholders were especially important in the nineteenth century. Many Highlanders emigrated to Canada, Australia and New Zealand where cheap or granted land offered a route to subsistence and social mobility.

Scots also went abroad for professional reasons. The British Empire provided opportunities for engineers, teachers, administrators, clergy and merchants. Steamship travel and improved communications made such careers more accessible. The movement was not unidirectional: letters, remittances and returning migrants maintained strong links between Scotland and its diaspora.

## Scots abroad: roles, influence and notable examples
Scottish migrants played visible roles across the empire and in settler societies. They worked in agriculture and pastoralism on Canadian and Australian farms, built railways and mines, set up businesses and introduced Scottish models of banking, education and law. Missionaries and teachers exported Presbyterian institutions and schools, while engineers and managers worked in imperial infrastructure projects. Individual Scots made striking contributions: Andrew Carnegie, born in Dunfermline, became a leading industrialist in the United States and later funded libraries and educational projects; John Muir from Dunbar emigrated to the United States and became a founding figure in the American conservation movement; Andrew Fisher, born in Ayrshire, rose to become Prime Minister of Australia. These examples show how individuals could leverage imperial networks to gain influence far beyond Scotland.

While many Scots prospered overseas, their presence also shaped local societies. Scottish ideas about agriculture, business and governance were transferred to colonies; Scottish migrants sometimes dominated particular trades or professions in new communities. The result was a two-way relationship: Scotland lost people and talent, but gained economic benefits through remittances and commercial ties, and its global reputation was extended through the achievements of its emigrants.

## Impact on Scotland: economy, society and identity
Migration altered Scotland’s social and economic landscape. Immigration supplemented labour in growing industries, contributed to urban diversity and created new cultural institutions. Emigration relieved population pressure in some areas but also removed young adults and skilled workers, affecting local economies. Remittances from emigrants were important for families back home and sometimes funded local improvements. Politically, migration shaped voting patterns and community organisation, particularly where immigrant groups became established and mobilised around religious or cultural concerns.

Culturally, migration contributed to a sense of a Scottish diaspora. Returned migrants brought new ideas and tastes; emigrant successes overseas fed national pride but also raised questions about opportunities at home. By the interwar years, migration patterns were affected by global economic shifts: the First World War, the 1920s boom and then the Depression of the 1930s reduced some flows and led to increased competition for jobs, while growing immigration controls in the UK and elsewhere changed routes and numbers. Overall, migration and empire were central to the making of modern Scotland, influencing identity, communities and economic structures.

## Sources and evidence historians use for this topic
Historians reconstruct migration and emigrant experience from a variety of sources. Official records—census returns, passenger lists and government reports—give statistics on movement, origin and destination. Newspapers, parish records and council minutes reveal debates about settlement, housing and welfare. Personal letters, diaries and memoirs provide vivid evidence of daily life, motivations for leaving or staying, and reactions to new places. Immigrant newspapers and community archives capture the language and organisation of particular groups. Business archives, shipping company records and the records of emigration societies show how migration was organised and financed. When studying this topic in class, it is useful to combine quantitative evidence (numbers, maps, occupational data) with qualitative sources (letters, newspaper reports, photographs) to build a rounded picture of migrant lives.

## Exam technique
Answering exam questions on Migration, Empire and Scots abroad requires combining source skills with factual knowledge and clear argument. For a ‘Describe’ question, pick two or three clear factual points about settlement patterns, employment or emigration schemes and develop each briefly. For an ‘Explain the reasons why’ question, structure your answer around distinct factors—economic, social, political—and explain how each caused migration, using dates or examples such as the Highland Clearances or the attraction of Canadian land to support your points. For a ‘To what extent’ or ‘How important’ essay, aim for a balanced response: introduce the question, present at least two or three factors with evidence, weigh their relative importance and reach a supported judgement.

When working with sources, always consider provenance: who produced the source, when and why? For ‘Evaluate the usefulness’ questions, assess author, purpose, timing, content and significant omissions, and use your own knowledge to show what the source adds and what it leaves out. For ‘Compare the views of Sources X and Y’, identify direct points of agreement and disagreement and give an overall assessment of their relationship, using outside knowledge to explain differences. For ‘How fully does Source X explain…?’ use the source’s content to make points, then supply omitted facts or reasons from your knowledge to show the source’s limitations.

In practice, plan your answers briefly before you write. In essays and longer responses, include an introduction that frames your argument, paragraphs that each develop a clear point with evidence, and a short conclusion that judges the overall issue. Where possible use named examples—specific groups, places, emigration schemes or individuals—to anchor your argument. Finally, balance source-based comments with your own facts and remember that clear structure, precise factual detail and linked explanations will gain marks.
