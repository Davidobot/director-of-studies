# National 5 History assignment: research, resource sheet and timed production (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview of the assignment and its purpose
The National 5 History assignment is the coursework component of the National 5 assessment and is worth 20 marks out of 100. It gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to research a historical question or issue, use evidence from at least two sources, analyse causes and effects, identify different perspectives and present a structured, reasoned conclusion. The assignment has two distinct stages. In the research stage you gather and organise evidence over a period designed to be completed in around eight hours. The production stage is a one hour, tightly controlled exercise in which you use only your History Resource Sheet to produce the submitted piece of work. The task is externally marked by SQA, so your work must be your own and follow the rules on supervision, reasonable assistance and authentication.

## Choosing an effective question
Choosing a good question is the single most important step in producing a strong assignment. A useful question is focused rather than too broad, allows you to bring in specific historical knowledge, and gives scope for analysis and judgement. Questions that ask “to what extent…”, “how important…”, or “how successful…” are ideal because they demand both explanation and evaluation. For example, titles such as “To what extent was propaganda the most important reason for Scots volunteering to fight on the Western Front in 1914?” or “How successful were the Liberal Reforms, 1906–1914, in helping those at risk from poverty?” guide you to compare factors and reach a supported conclusion. Avoid overly general prompts like “Describe World War I” which do not lend themselves to evaluation, and instead frame your focus around a clear issue that will let you weigh evidence and viewpoints.

## The research stage and the History Resource Sheet
The research stage is conducted under some supervision and control and is intended to be completed across a series of study sessions. During this stage you may use any resources available to you, but you must keep a clear record of progress so your teacher can authenticate the work. Your research should gather material from at least two distinct sources, ideally a mix of primary and secondary material; note the origin, author, date, purpose and content for each source and record any points of bias or omission you identify. The History Resource Sheet is a crucial product of this stage. It must be a single side of A4, no more than 200 words, and is the only resource you may take into the timed production. The Resource Sheet should not try to reproduce your final answer but should instead act as a compact organiser: state your precise question, a brief thesis sentence, key factual reminders (dates, names, events) and short notes of the two or three strongest pieces of evidence you plan to use, with concise references. Remember that the Resource Sheet itself is not assessed for content, but failure to submit it will incur a penalty of four marks from the assignment total, so include it and keep it within the 200 word limit.

## Production of evidence: the one-hour controlled task
The production stage must be completed under a high degree of supervision and control, in one sitting, with you in direct sight of the assessor and with no communication with other candidates. During this hour you may use only your History Resource Sheet. Plan your time carefully: spend a few minutes re-reading the question and annotating your Resource Sheet, around forty to forty-five minutes writing, and leave time at the end to review and refine your language and argument. Structure your response clearly. Begin with a short introduction that rephrases the question and states your overall judgement. Follow with at least two balanced and developed factors that explain causes or assess impact, using specific factual knowledge and linking each point directly to the question. For higher marks, move from explanation into evaluation by offering extended comments that weigh the relative importance of your factors and use evidence to support your judgements. End with a concise conclusion that summarises your reasoned judgement and shows how the evidence supports it. Throughout, make clear reference to the sources you used in research, showing how they support or challenge your argument.

## Supervision, authentication and reasonable assistance
Teachers will supervise the research stage and must put in place measures to demonstrate that the work is your own. Typical methods include interim progress meetings, questioning, and keeping a record of activity. Group work can be used during research but each candidate must provide clear individual evidence. Reasonable assistance from teachers is permitted in guiding choices of suitable question types, suggesting general areas to investigate and giving advice on sources and planning, but assessors must not provide the question, direct candidates to specific resources, give model answers or provide detailed feedback on drafts. If a candidate requires more help than what is deemed reasonable, they may not be ready for assessment at this level. During the production stage assessors must ensure direct supervision; candidates must not communicate, must be in sight of the assessor, and can only use the History Resource Sheet.

## What the marking looks for and how to structure your answer
The assignment is assessed against eight aspects that range from choosing and referencing a question to presenting a supported conclusion. The marks reward clear and relevant knowledge, the ability to analyse causes and/or impacts, the evaluation of different perspectives, the use of evidence from at least two sources, and the organisation and clarity of the final response. In practice, examiners look for a short focused introduction, at least two developed paragraphs that combine historical knowledge with analysis, evaluation that goes beyond description by making relative judgements and explaining significance, and a concluding judgement that ties everything together. For example, an effective evaluative comment might state that “overall, propaganda was more important in causing Scots to volunteer in 1914 than either patriotism or the pals battalions, because it permeated everyday life from workplaces to leisure and applied social pressure,” and then supply specific evidence from your research. Another model comment might evaluate Liberal reforms by noting that “reforms for the young were less successful than those for the elderly because implementation was slower and the measures had limited reach before 1914.” Use short quotations or succinct references on your Resource Sheet so you can attribute evidence quickly in the one-hour production.

## Common pitfalls and practical tips for teachers and students
Students often lose marks by choosing questions that are too broad, by failing to reference or use at least two sources, or by turning the production stage into a narrative rather than an analytical essay. To avoid these problems, practise selecting focused questions, producing a 200-word Resource Sheet, and completing at least one timed production under exam conditions before the assessed production. Keep research notes concise and purposeful: the Resource Sheet should function as an aide-mémoire rather than a script. Teachers should encourage independent research while maintaining records of progress meetings, provide students with opportunities to practise evaluation and judgement, and clarify what counts as reasonable assistance. Authenticity checks are normal: be ready to explain your choices and to show how your resource sheet relates to your final answer.

## Exam technique
In the one-hour production treat time management as part of your exam technique. Begin by spending a few minutes rewording the question into an answerable focus and annotating your Resource Sheet to highlight the evidence you will use. Establish your main judgement in a crisp introduction and ensure each paragraph begins with a clear point that answers the question, followed by specific factual detail and then analysis or evaluation that links back to the question. When evaluating, make comparative comments that judge the relative importance of factors and back these judgements with evidence you gathered earlier. Keep quotations short and always explain their relevance. Watch your use of time so you have at least five minutes at the end to proofread and strengthen your conclusion. Finally, ensure your Resource Sheet meets the technical rules: single side of A4, no more than 200 words, and submitted with your assignment. Clear planning, disciplined use of evidence, focused analysis and a reasoned conclusion are the essentials that turn knowledge into the marks the assignment rewards.
