# Source evaluation and contextualisation (National 5 skills) (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Why source skills matter
Source evaluation and contextualisation are not optional extras in National 5 History; they are central skills that show how historians use evidence to build arguments about the past. Whether you are answering a question in the exam or producing your assignment, examiners are looking for your ability to judge where a source comes from, why it was produced, what it actually says, and how far it can be trusted or used to answer a specific question. These skills allow you to move beyond simply repeating facts and instead to explain the strength of the evidence that supports particular interpretations. In practice this means reading sources carefully, linking them to your own knowledge, and making balanced judgements about their usefulness, reliability and limitations.

## Types of source and the key questions to ask
Sources come in different shapes and voices: speeches, letters, newspaper reports, official documents, memoirs, diaries, statistical tables, and later interpretations by historians. The most important first step is always to identify what kind of source you are dealing with and who produced it. Is it a primary source written by someone who witnessed or took part in the events, or is it a secondary source produced afterwards? The author’s position and possible motives matter: a government minister, a factory inspector, a soldier or a journalist may all present the same event very differently. Timing is another crucial factor. A newspaper report written during a crisis will reflect what could be known at the time; a memoir written decades later may be shaped by later hindsight or by the author’s desire to protect their reputation. Always ask: who wrote this, when was it written, and why was it written?

## Evaluating usefulness and reliability
When you are asked to evaluate the usefulness of a source, you should focus on two linked ideas: how reliable the source is, and how useful it is for answering the specific question. Reliability depends on factors such as the author’s knowledge, possible bias, and the internal consistency of the source. Usefulness depends on whether the source contains relevant information for the question and whether it provides perspectives or facts that you cannot get elsewhere. A good answer will discuss both the positive and negative aspects of a source. For example, a letter from a Scottish noble in 1306 describing Robert Bruce’s actions might be useful because it records contemporary attitudes, but it might be unreliable if the noble had a personal grievance against Bruce. Your evaluation should identify points the source makes and then weigh them against its limitations, such as obvious omissions, exaggeration, or a narrow viewpoint.

## Contextualisation: placing the source in the wider story
Contextualisation means using your own knowledge to place a source within the wider historical story and to judge how fully the source describes or explains an event or development. You should demonstrate that you can link the source to events, causes and consequences that lie outside the source itself. For instance, if a source from 1710 argues that the Treaty of Union was purely about Scottish corruption, you might contextualise by adding knowledge about the Darien disaster, the economic pressures on Scotland, and the English Acts such as the Alien Act. Contextualisation does not mean a general essay about the topic; it must be used to test the source. You should show what the source misses and how other evidence helps to build a fuller picture. In practice, make short, precise paragraphs that quote or refer to the source, then follow with targeted recall that either supports or challenges the source’s claims.

## Comparing sources and spotting agreement and difference
Comparison questions ask you to compare the views of two sources on the same issue. The strongest answers make direct, point-by-point comparisons rather than talking about each source separately. Start by identifying the specific claims each source makes and then compare them on those claims: do they agree about causes or effects, do they emphasise different actors, or do they reflect contrasting perspectives because of different authorship or audience? For example, a contemporaneous British merchant’s account of the triangular trade will emphasise economic benefit and may underplay cruelty, while a former enslaved person’s narrative will foreground violence and resistance. A good comparative judgement will also consider why the sources differ: different purposes, different audiences, differences in information available, or deliberate propaganda. End with an overall comparison that summarises the balance of agreement and disagreement and explains which source you find more convincing on particular points.

## Dealing with omission and distracters
Strong source work looks not only at what a source contains but at what it leaves out. The course assessment design often builds in “points of significant omission” and “distracters” — pieces of information or phrasing that might mislead an uncritical reader. Identifying omission is especially important for contextualisation questions that ask “How fully does Source X explain…?” or “How fully does Source X describe…?”. To answer those questions you need to set out what the source does say, then provide specific, relevant facts or explanations that the source does not mention. For example, a source that blames the “mob” for unrest during industrialisation may omit the role of low wages, unsafe housing and lack of sanitation; pointing to those omissions shows deeper understanding and gains credit. With distracters, explain why a particular detail is included yet not central to the historian’s question; this shows you can separate supporting evidence from red herrings.

## The assignment, resource sheet and assessment conditions
The National 5 assignment is a chance to apply source skills in an extended piece of work. You choose a historical question, research it using a range of materials, and then produce a piece of written evidence in one hour under strict conditions. The research stage should be thorough and can be completed over a notional period of about eight hours; the production stage is done in one sitting with high supervision and access only to a single-sided History Resource Sheet of no more than 200 words. That resource sheet is not marked, but failure to submit it results in a penalty of four marks, so prepare it carefully. During research you can receive reasonable assistance on planning and on locating sources, but assessors must not provide the topic, the sources, or detailed drafting support. When choosing a question, pick a focused issue that allows you to collect at least two different kinds of evidence and to evaluate causes, impact or significance. In your final hour, organise your answer clearly: start with a brief introduction that sets out the issue and your line of argument, use knowledge and source evidence to develop balanced analytical points, identify different perspectives where relevant, and end with a concise conclusion that answers the question.

## Using language and structure to show analysis
The difference between a descriptive answer and an analytical answer is often the way you link evidence to judgement. Use phrases that make your reasoning explicit: explain how the author’s position affects what they say, show how the timing changes reliability, and make comparative language clear when discussing two sources. When evaluating usefulness, move from description to judgement by stating an evaluative comment and supporting it with reasons and evidence. For contextualisation, follow each claim taken from the source with corroborating or contradictory factual detail from your knowledge. Short, focused paragraphs that each make a single point tend to be clearer and more persuasive than long, aimless paragraphs. In assignments and in the exam, avoid generic assertions like “this source is biased” without explaining how and why; examiners reward detailed, specific analysis linked to the question.

## Exam technique
When you are in the exam, time management and clarity are as important as what you know. Begin by reading the question paper quickly to choose the sections you will answer, then read each chosen question carefully to be sure you respond to the exact task. For a Describe question, make clear, relevant factual points and develop them where possible. For Explain questions, give reasons and link each reason explicitly to the question. For short essay questions framed as “To what extent…?” or “How important…?”, include an introduction that outlines the factors you will discuss, balance at least two developed factors with supporting evidence, and finish with a reasoned judgement that weighs factors against each other. For Evaluate the usefulness questions, discuss the author, timing, purpose, type and content of the source, and identify significant omissions; conclude by saying whether the source is useful and in what ways. For Compare questions aim for direct comparisons on particular points and end with an overall assessment of similarity or difference. For How fully/Contextualisation questions, state clearly how much of the event or explanation the source covers and support this with both source detail and your own recall of what the source omits. Remember that SQA’s question paper will include a mix of source lengths and formats; source-based evaluation questions will typically expect you to draw on specific lines from the source rather than general impression. Practise past questions under timed conditions, prepare short banked paragraphs of factual recall for major topics such as Bannockburn, the Reformation, the Industrial Revolution, the World Wars and 20th-century dictatorships, and rehearse linking those facts to source material quickly. Finally, always answer the question set, not the question you hoped would be asked; precise relevance to the question is the single most important factor in gaining top marks.
