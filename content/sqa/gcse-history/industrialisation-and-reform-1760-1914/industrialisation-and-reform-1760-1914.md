# Changing Britain: Industrialisation and reform (1760–1914) (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## The Industrial Revolution: causes and consequences
The period from about 1760 to 1914 transformed Britain from a largely rural, agrarian society into the world’s first industrial nation. Industrialisation began with changes in agriculture that increased food production and released labour from the land: enclosure of common fields, new crop rotations and more efficient methods reduced the number of people needed to work farms. At the same time, technological innovation in textiles and iron changed how goods were produced. The spinning jenny, the water frame, the power loom and James Watt’s improved steam engine multiplied the speed and scale of manufacture. Coal and iron became the raw materials of industry, while entrepreneurs and investors created factories that concentrated labour and machinery in one place. The result was a dramatic rise in production, a growing export trade and the creation of industrial towns and cities whose populations swelled as people moved in search of work.

This shift had wide-ranging effects. Economically, a market economy spread across the country: farmers, manufacturers and transport networks became linked. Socially, the balance between town and country shifted as urban centres such as Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow expanded. Culturally and politically, industrialisation created new social groups — an industrial bourgeoisie of factory-owners and merchants, and a growing urban working class — each with new interests and voices. These changes set the scene for debates about work, welfare and the role of government that would occupy British politics throughout the nineteenth century.

## Urban growth, housing and public health
Rapid urbanisation created severe pressures on housing and public health. Towns could expand almost overnight when a new mill or mine opened, but housing provision lagged behind. Many working families lived in overcrowded tenements or back-to-back houses with poor ventilation and inadequate sanitation. Streets were narrow, drains were often open, and clean water supplies were patchy. These conditions encouraged the spread of disease. Cholera outbreaks in the mid-19th century, and recurring epidemics of typhus and tuberculosis, revealed the human cost of unplanned growth.

Public concern gradually produced reform. Edwin Chadwick’s reports on sanitary conditions argued that disease and death could be reduced by proper drainage, sewage disposal and clean water, and this thinking influenced the 1848 Public Health Act which allowed local authorities to improve sanitation. The work of John Snow during a cholera outbreak in London showed how contaminated water could spread the disease and strengthened the case for piped water and better sewers. Large-scale engineering projects, most famously Joseph Bazalgette’s Victorian London sewer system, and the later Public Health Act of 1875, brought tangible improvements in urban living conditions and public health, although slum clearance and improved housing were gradual and uneven across Britain.

## Work in factories and mines: labour, risks and reform
Industrial workplaces produced wealth but at high human cost. Textile factories demanded long hours of repetitive labour under strict discipline. Coal mining was dangerous and physically demanding; accidents, inhalation of dust and poor lighting made mines hazardous. Women and children formed a significant part of the labour force because they could be paid less. Child labour in mills and mines caused public outcry once the scale and severity of the problem were understood.

Pressure for reform came from various directions. Factory legislation began to limit hours and improve conditions. Early laws such as the Factory Acts of the 1830s and 1840s restricted child labour and required some schooling, while later acts reduced working hours for women and adolescents, culminating in efforts to regulate adult working time. The Mines Act of 1842 banned women and young children from underground work, responding to moral and safety concerns highlighted by reports and inspectors. Trade unions, growing in membership and confidence after the repeal of Combination Acts in the 1820s, increasingly organised strikes and negotiated for better pay and conditions. Figures such as Robert Owen campaigned for improved conditions and education for workers, and his cooperative experiments at New Lanark offered an early model of industrial paternalism and social reform.

Although legislation improved things slowly, the cumulative effect of factory regulations, inspectors and growing public sympathy produced a measurable improvement in the everyday lives of many workers by the late nineteenth century.

## Transport and the expansion of markets
Transport innovation underpinned industrial growth. Canals built in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries created the first low-cost routes for heavy goods such as coal, iron and raw cotton. Canals linked inland towns to ports and to one another, reducing transport costs and stimulating regional specialisation. The arrival of the railway in the 1830s, epitomised by the Liverpool and Manchester line and early locomotives such as Stephenson’s Rocket, accelerated change. Railways moved raw materials to factories and finished goods to markets with unprecedented speed and reliability. They knitted distant regions into a national market, lowered the cost of food and fuel for urban populations and allowed manufacturers to sell more widely.

The railway boom also reshaped the landscape and social life. New towns grew around stations, and middle-class commuters could live farther from work. Industries such as engineering and coal mining expanded to supply railway demand. While some older transport forms, particularly many canals, declined in importance, others adapted. The overall effect was greater economic integration and the rapid expansion of internal and international trade.

## Political change: pressure for reform up to 1914
Industrialisation generated political tensions because the structures of political power had not kept pace with social and economic change. Many new industrial towns had little or no parliamentary representation, while “rotten boroughs” with few voters still elected MPs. Popular protest and political organising challenged this status quo. The radical movement culminated in events such as the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, when cavalry charged a peaceful reform meeting in Manchester, shocking public opinion and showing both the strength of working-class agitation and the readiness of authorities to use force.

Chartism, emerging in the late 1830s, articulated working-class demands in the People’s Charter: universal male suffrage, the secret ballot, no property qualification for MPs, annual Parliaments, payment for MPs and equal constituencies. Chartism mobilised large numbers and demonstrated the depth of popular demand for political equality, even though its petitions were rejected in Parliament. The Reform Act of 1832, driven by middle-class pressures and the threat of unrest, redistributed seats and extended the franchise to a wider section of the propertied classes, but it left many working men without the vote. Subsequent Reform Acts in 1867 and 1884 further extended the franchise to more urban and then rural male householders, gradually creating a much broader electorate and paving the way for modern party politics. These changes were not simply legislative; they reflected the growing political voice of new social groups shaped by industrial Britain.

## Social movements and the beginnings of the welfare response
Industrial Britain saw the rise of organised social movements and the first steps toward state intervention in social welfare. The rapid growth of voluntary organisations, friendly societies, and philanthropic enterprises provided mutual aid for workers. Campaigns for free education, temperance, and housing reform were carried out by a mixture of religious groups, philanthropists and activists. The mid to late nineteenth century witnessed important charitable initiatives and municipal activism aimed at improving schools, slum housing and sanitation.

The idea that government had a role to play in protecting the health and welfare of citizens broke with laissez-faire thinking, particularly as the social costs of poverty and ill health became more visible. State action increased gradually: public health legislation, factory and mining regulation, and municipal improvements were all early examples of this shift. These developments laid the groundwork for the more comprehensive welfare reforms of the twentieth century, but it is important to see them as the outcome of long debates about responsibility, citizenship and the relationship between the state and the individual.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Changing Britain, it is essential to link specific knowledge to the question being asked. For “describe” questions, focus on clear factual points and aim for one well-developed sentence per mark. For “explain” questions, give reasons and show the connection between cause and effect; where possible support explanations with concrete examples — for instance, refer to the Mines Act 1842 when explaining how Parliament responded to mining dangers, or to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway when explaining the impact of railways on trade.

For short essays (To what extent?/How important?/How successful?), structure your answer with a brief introduction that states your overall judgement, two or three balanced reasons with specific evidence, and a concluding paragraph that returns to your judgement and explains why the factors you have discussed lead you to that view. Use key dates, legislation and individuals to strengthen your argument, and avoid generic statements without supportive detail.

Source questions require careful reading and contextual knowledge. When asked to evaluate a source’s usefulness, consider the author, the type of source, its purpose and timing, the content it provides, and what it omits. Explain how each of these aspects affects the source’s reliability and usefulness for the historian’s question. For comparison questions, identify points where the sources agree and disagree and use your own knowledge to judge which view is better supported or to explain why differences might exist. For “how fully” questions, point to what the source does say and then use outside knowledge to show what is left out or simplified.

Time management matters: read the paper through at the start, allocate time in proportion to the marks available, and plan short essays before you start writing. In the assignment, choose a clear, focused question you can answer well with the available research, gather at least two relevant sources, and use the permitted History Resource Sheet effectively to organise your evidence. Remember the assignment is completed under controlled conditions in one hour, so practice planning and producing an extended answer under timed conditions before the exam.

Above all, show that you can connect facts to explanations and judgements. Knowing dates, laws and names is important, but being able to explain causes, consequences and significance — and to assess evidence — is what achieves the higher grades.
