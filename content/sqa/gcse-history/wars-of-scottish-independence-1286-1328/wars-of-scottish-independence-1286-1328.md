# Wars of Scottish Independence (1286–1328) (GCSE History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: what the wars were about and why they matter
The Wars of Scottish Independence were a series of conflicts between Scotland and England that began after the death of Alexander III in 1286 and ended with the Treaty of Edinburgh‑Northampton in 1328. At their heart these wars were about more than military victories: they were contests over who had the right to rule Scotland, over Scottish national identity, and over the authority of kings and magnates. The period saw the rise of famous figures such as William Wallace and Robert Bruce, dramatic battles like Stirling Bridge, Falkirk and Bannockburn, and important political documents such as the Declaration of Arbroath. The wars transformed Scottish society, strengthened ideas of nationhood and left a legacy that has shaped how Scots have remembered their past ever since.

## The succession crisis, 1286–1292: the Great Cause
The trouble began when Alexander III died in 1286, leaving no surviving legitimate heir. His granddaughter Margaret, the Maid of Norway, was recognised as heiress but died en route to Scotland in 1290, plunging the kingdom into a succession crisis. Competing claims from powerful families, notably the Balliols and the Bruces, threatened civil war. To avoid bloodshed the Scots invited Edward I of England to arbitrate. Edward accepted but used the opportunity to assert overlordship of Scotland. At Norham in 1292 he pronounced in favour of John Balliol in what became known as the Great Cause. Although Balliol was made king, Edward’s judgement came with strings attached: he treated Scotland as subordinate when it suited him, demanding homage and interfering in Scottish government. Earlier attempts to protect Margaret’s right to rule through the Treaty of Birgham (1290), which guaranteed Scottish laws and institutions, collapsed when Edward exploited the ambiguity of his role as arbiter to increase English influence.

## Edward I and the English campaign, 1292–1296
John Balliol’s kingship was weak. Many Scottish nobles resented his subservience to Edward, and the situation worsened when England and France went to war and Scotland’s traditional diplomatic options narrowed. In 1296 Edward invaded. The sack of Berwick in March 1296 was a brutal opening act: the town was taken and many civilians killed. Balliol was defeated, humiliated, and forced to abdicate; he was later imprisoned in the Tower of London. Edward proclaimed himself overlord and demanded that Scottish magnates swear fealty—many did so in what are known as the Ragman Rolls. For a time England seemed to have conquered Scotland, but Edward’s rule provoked resistance. His attempts to subjugate Scotland by installing English sheriffs and governors created resentment and set the stage for armed rebellion.

## William Wallace and early Scottish resistance, 1297–1305
Opposition to English rule quickly coalesced into armed resistance in several places. William Wallace emerged as a leader after a local uprising that culminated in the important Scottish victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in September 1297. At Stirling, Wallace and Andrew Moray used terrain and surprise to defeat a larger English force; the victory did much to rally Scottish morale and briefly established Wallace as Guardian of Scotland. However, unity among the Scots was fragile and English military resources were formidable. In July 1298 Edward I personally returned and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk; English longbowmen and cavalry broke the Scots’ schiltrons, and Wallace’s position as guardian ended. He continued to resist as a partisan leader but was eventually captured in 1305, taken to London and executed for treason. Wallace’s career is important for what it tells us about popular resistance, the limits of noble leadership at times of crisis, and how contemporary and later sources shaped his image as a national hero.

## Robert Bruce, guerrilla war and diplomatic success, 1306–1328
Robert Bruce’s path to kingship began in conflict with other Scottish nobles. In 1306 he murdered his rival John Comyn at Greyfriars Church in Dumfries and then had himself crowned King Robert I at Scone. This act divided the Scots: some supported Bruce, others opposed him or sided with the English. After early setbacks and defeats, Bruce adopted a strategy of guerrilla warfare, avoiding pitched battle where English forces were strongest and focusing on recapturing castles and cutting off English strongpoints. Over several years he rebuilt support among the nobles, exploited English political weakness—especially after Edward I’s death in 1307 and the later failures of Edward II—and reorganised the Scottish military. The turning point came at the Battle of Bannockburn in June 1314, where Robert’s use of terrain, well-drilled infantry formations (schiltrons), and coordinated leadership defeated a much larger English force under Edward II. Bannockburn became a symbol of Scottish military resurgence.

War was not won by force alone. Robert Bruce combined battlefield skill with diplomacy. He pursued alliances, notably with France through the Auld Alliance, and worked to legitimize his rule at home and abroad. The Declaration of Arbroath in 1320 is a key documentary expression of Scottish nationhood; addressed to the Pope, it argued for Scotland’s independence and for Bruce’s kingship as the will of the people and the nobility. After a prolonged struggle and changing politics in England—Edward II’s defeat and deposition in 1327, and the unsettled situation under Edward III—England recognised Scotland’s independence in the Treaty of Edinburgh‑Northampton in 1328. This treaty acknowledged Robert I as king and included the marriage of his son David II to Joan of the Tower (a daughter of Edward II), sealing diplomatic peace for the moment.

## Key themes, sources and interpretations
The Wars of Independence show how legal claims, dynastic politics, military innovation and popular support interacted. Authority and legitimacy were contested: Edward I claimed overlordship using feudal language, while Scots insisted on their kingdom’s independence. Identity developed through resistance—documents such as the Declaration of Arbroath deliberately frame Scotland as a nation with a right to self-government. Military change is also clear: Scottish tactics at Stirling and Bannockburn demonstrate how infantry could neutralise cavalry, and how leadership and local knowledge mattered as much as numbers.

When studying the period students should use a mix of sources. Contemporary chronicles, English and Scottish royal records, and documents like the Declaration of Arbroath or the Treaty of Birgham are invaluable primary evidence. Later accounts such as Blind Harry’s epic poem on Wallace reflect how memory and myth grow around historical figures and must be treated carefully. Historians debate factors such as the extent to which Bruce’s success depended on personal leadership, on the failure of English kings, or on changing international politics like the Auld Alliance and the situation in France. Understanding these debates helps when asked to assess the importance of different causes.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on this topic effectively requires clear organisation, accurate use of evidence and attention to the question type. For a 'Describe' question give two or three clear, factual points with dates and names—for example, “At Stirling Bridge (1297) Wallace defeated the English army using the narrow bridge and terrain to stop cavalry.” For 'Explain' questions link causes and effects: explain why Edward invaded in 1296 by discussing Balliol’s weakness, the death of Margaret, and Edward’s political ambitions, and show how each factor contributed.

For 'To what extent' or 'How important' essays decide early which factors you will discuss, give balanced development of at least two or three reasons, and then make a judgement about their relative importance in your conclusion. A good structure is: brief introduction that directly answers the question, two paragraphs arguing for important factors, one paragraph presenting counterarguments or other factors, and a concluding paragraph that weighs the evidence and reaches a clear judgement.

In source questions you must do two things: use the source and use your own knowledge. When asked to 'Evaluate the usefulness' consider the author (who wrote it and why), the type of source (letter, chronicle, declaration), the date (how close to the events described), and the content (what it tells you). Also identify omissions—what the source does not say that you know from other evidence. For instance, when evaluating the Declaration of Arbroath, note that its purpose was political persuasion of the Pope and it presents Scotland as united under Bruce; it is useful for understanding claims to independence but less useful for impartial details of military events.

For 'Compare the views of Sources X and Y' focus on direct comparisons: point out agreements and disagreements in content, tone and purpose, and explain why they might differ. Always support comparisons with your own factual knowledge. For 'How fully does Source X describe/explain…' evaluate both what the source includes and what it leaves out, and use outside evidence to fill gaps.

Time management is crucial in the exam. Read all questions carefully, choose the Scottish option if required, and plan short essay answers before writing. Use dates and names to anchor your answers and avoid vague statements. When writing essays aim for clarity and structured paragraphs: each paragraph should make one main point, explain it, and then link it explicitly to the question.

Finally, practise using specific examples: Stirling Bridge (1297), Falkirk (1298), Bannockburn (1314), the Ragman Rolls (1296), the Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Treaty of Edinburgh‑Northampton (1328). Knowing these events with their dates and significance will make your answers more precise and convincing.
