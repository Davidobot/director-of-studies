# Glacial and coastal landforms (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction
Glacial and coastal landforms represent two of the most dramatic ways that water in its solid and liquid forms shapes the landscape. In Scotland and elsewhere in the UK these landforms record past ice ages and ongoing coastal processes; they also illustrate fundamental geomorphological principles such as erosion, transport and deposition. For Higher/A‑level study you must know the processes that create specific landforms, be able to describe the sequence of events that produces them, and use named examples to show how theory matches the real world. This guide brings together the key processes, the characteristic landforms they produce, relevant British examples and practical suggestions for fieldwork and exam answers.

## Glacial systems and processes
Glaciers are powerful agents of erosion and deposition. They form where annual snowfall exceeds melt, packing snow into firn and then into ice that moves downslope under gravity. There are two main glacier types relevant to the UK: valley glaciers (confined in former upland valleys) and the much larger ice sheets that once covered Scotland and northern Britain during Quaternary glaciations. Movement of ice occurs by internal deformation and by sliding at the base where meltwater lubricates the bed. Two erosion mechanisms dominate: abrasion, as rock fragments in the ice grind against the bed and sides like sandpaper, and plucking, where meltwater freezes in cracks and then pulls blocks away as the ice moves. Meltwater, channelled on, within and beneath ice, also contributes to erosion and extensive sediment transport. Where flow slows or melts, the glacier deposits a mix of unsorted rock fragments called till; meltwater streams produce better-sorted sediments and distinctive landforms such as eskers.

Understanding these processes is essential because the landforms you must describe are the physical record of how ice moved and melted. Factors that affect landform development include the ice thickness and velocity, the thermal regime of the glacier (warm-based vs cold-based), the nature of the bedrock and its structure, and the presence and volume of meltwater.

## Glacial erosional landforms
Glacial erosion carves a characteristic suite of landforms. Corrie (cirque) formation begins with nivation and hollowing on a shaded, sheltered mountain side. As snow accumulates and transforms into ice within the hollow, rotational movement enlarges the depression. Abrasion deepens the basin and plucking steepens the back wall; when ice finally retreats, the corrie often contains a small lake or tarn. A string of corries aligned on opposite sides of a ridge promote headward erosion and the development of an arête: a sharp, knife‑edged ridge formed where two corries erode towards each other. Where three or more corries erode around a summit, a pyramidal peak forms; Buachaille Etive Mòr in Glencoe and the Cuillin Ridge on Skye provide UK images of these processes on a dramatic scale, while the Matterhorn remains the classic international example.

Valley glaciers transform V-shaped river valleys into U-shaped troughs through a combination of abrasion across the bed and plucking of the valley sides, producing steep valley sides and a flat, scoured floor. Hanging valleys occur where small tributary glaciers were less erosive than the main glacier; after deglaciation the tributary valley mouth sits high above the main valley floor and often feeds waterfalls. Ribbon lakes, long and narrow water bodies such as Windermere in the Lake District, occupy deepened sections of a glacial trough where differential erosion by ice exploited zones of weaker rock or where overdeepening occurred beneath thicker or faster-flowing ice. Recognising the sequence—snow accumulation, ice movement, focused erosion and post-glacial modification—helps explain the spatial patterns of these features in upland landscapes.

## Glacial depositional landforms
Where the glacier melts or slows it deposits the materials it has carried, forming a distinct set of depositional landforms. Moraines are accumulations of till. A terminal moraine marks the furthest advance of an ice front and can form ridges across a valley or coastline. Lateral moraines trace the edges of former glaciers and, where two lateral moraines meet, medial moraines run down the centre of a valley. Drumlins are streamlined, elliptical hills of compacted till orientated in the direction of ice flow; regions of drumlin fields—often found in parts of Scotland, northern England and Ireland—record the flow patterns of former ice sheets and can be used to infer ice direction and dynamics. Their formation remains complex and debated, but the most accepted explanations involve a combination of subglacial deforming tills and meltwater reworking.

Eskers are sinuous ridges of sand and gravel deposited by subglacial meltwater streams in ice-walled tunnels; when the ice melts away these channel deposits remain as raised ridges winding across lowland terrain. Because eskers are formed by flowing water they are well-sorted and often used as convenient sources of aggregate. Till blankets and hummocky moraines mark areas of stagnating ice and irregular deposition. Together, these depositional features provide evidence of the melting stages and hydrology of deglaciation, showing where ice stagnated, where meltwater flowed and where ice lobes stabilised.

## Coastal processes
Coastal landforms result from the interaction of waves, tides, sea-level change and the geology of the shoreline. Waves deliver energy; their erosive power depends on wave height, period and the fetch over which they form. Constructive waves, with long wavelength and gentle swash, tend to deposit material; destructive waves, with steep profile, strong backwash and more energy, favour erosion. The principal erosional mechanisms are hydraulic action (the force of water and the compression of air in cracks), abrasion (sediment hurled against rock faces), attrition (sediment particles breaking into smaller pieces) and solution or corrosion (chemical attack on soluble rock). Weathering onshore and mass movement also supplies material to beaches. Longshore drift transports sediment along the coast in the direction of prevailing wave approach; where the coastline changes shape or current weakens, deposition builds features such as spits and bars.

Sea-level change—whether eustatic (global changes in sea level due to ice volume) or isostatic (local land uplift or subsidence, as in post-glacial rebound)—significantly alters coastal profiles. Post-glacial rebound around Britain means some former shorelines are raised above present sea level, while subsidence and rising sea level in other areas have drowned river valleys to create rias or steep-sided fjords where glacial troughs were inundated.

## Coastal landforms: erosion and deposition in sequence
The classic headland-to-bay coastline forms where bands of resistant and less-resistant rock lie at right angles to wave approach. The weak rock is eroded faster to form bays, while the hard rock projects as headlands concentrating wave energy and encouraging further erosion. On a headland, wave action enlarges cracks into caves by hydraulic action and abrasion; continued erosion deepens caves until they break through to form arches. Once the arch roof collapses under gravity and weathering, a stack remains as an isolated pillar of rock; ongoing erosion reduces a stack to a stump. Wave-cut platforms, gently sloping rocky surfaces exposed at low tide, form as cliffs retreat, leaving a platform of bedrock smoothed by abrasion and weathered by tides. The Jurassic Coast in Dorset provides clear examples: Lulworth Cove illustrates bay formation, Durdle Door shows an arch in chalk, and Old Harry Rocks on the Isle of Purbeck demonstrate the stack sequence.

On coasts dominated by sediment transport, longshore drift can extend material across bays to form spits, bars and tombolos. A spit is a depositional ridge that grows from the shoreline in the direction of sediment transport, often curving landward at its distal end as wave direction changes. Spurn Head on the Humber Estuary is a classic example of an evolving spit fed by sediment from the Holderness cliffs. A bar forms where a spit continues across a bay to connect headlands and may enclose a lagoon behind it. Tombolos are ridges of sand or shingle that join an island to the mainland; Chesil Beach and the tombolo linking the Isle of Portland offer British examples, while St Ninian's Isle in Shetland is a celebrated tombolo that appears and disappears with shifting tides and storms.

## Links between glacial and coastal landforms, and the role of sea-level change
Glacial and coastal processes do not operate in isolation. Glacially carved valleys that reach the coast may be drowned by sea-level rise to form fjords; where river valleys were drowned without glacial overdeepening, rias develop. Many UK sea cliffs and coastal platforms expose glacial deposits such as tills and moraines, which influence rates of coastal erosion and the supply of sediment to beaches. Post-glacial isostatic adjustment has left raised beaches and marine terraces around parts of Scotland, giving clear stratigraphic evidence of former sea levels. In the contemporary context, accelerating sea-level rise and changes in storminess alter erosion rates and sediment budgets, making an understanding of past glacial and depositional legacies important for coastal management. Human interventions—sea walls, groynes and managed realignment—change sediment transport and can protect infrastructure but often shift erosion elsewhere; effective management therefore depends on understanding both the physical processes and the longer-term, post-glacial landscape inheritance.

## Fieldwork and investigation approaches
Studying glacial and coastal landforms in the field tests both observational and analytical skills and is excellent preparation for assignments. At upland glacial sites, sensible fieldwork includes mapping landforms and orientations of drumlins or roches moutonnées to infer ice flow direction, sketching and annotating corries and arêtes, measuring valley cross-sections to demonstrate U-shaped profiles, and sampling lateral moraines or drumlin sediments to compare grain size and composition. In coastal settings, beach profile surveys, pebble size and roundness sampling along transects, and observations of sediment movement after storms reveal the balance between erosion and deposition. Simple laboratory techniques—sieve analysis or pebble axis ratio measurements—allow students to quantify sorting and transport histories. Using maps and GIS to combine field observations with wider spatial data helps link local evidence to regional patterns; for example, GPS and aerial imagery can locate eskers and trace their sinuosity across a post-glacial plain. When designing an assignment, choose a focused question that links process and landform (for example, how does grain size change along a spit, or how does valley cross-section vary with distance downstream in a formerly glaciated valley) and collect data that allow clear, evidence-based conclusions.

## Exam technique
In exam answers always move from description to explanation. When asked to describe a landform, begin with its observable characteristics: shape, size, orientation and position in the landscape. Then explain the processes and sequence that produced those features, using process verbs such as “abrasion”, “plucking”, “longshore drift” and “overdeepening”; this shows understanding rather than mere description. Diagrams are highly effective: a well-labelled sketch of a corrie with arrows showing rotational movement, or of the cave-arch-stack sequence, gains marks quickly. When explaining formation, link the process to the landform’s final appearance—explain how process A leads to feature B. Always try to include a specific example to anchor your answer—naming a Scottish corrie, a Lake District ribbon lake or a Dorset arch demonstrates applied knowledge. For extended-response questions, structure your answers into clear paragraphs that each develop a point: start with a topic sentence, expand with process explanation, add an example or evidence, and conclude the paragraph by linking back to the question. For evaluation or “to what extent” questions, weigh different factors (for example, rock type, wave energy, human activity) and judge their relative importance; show awareness of temporal scales and uncertainty, for instance that drumlin formation is still debated or that coastal features will respond differently to short-term storms versus long-term sea-level rise. Use geographical terminology accurately and where relevant include quantitative evidence from fieldwork or secondary sources. Finally, practice past paper questions under timed conditions and use annotated diagrams to practise combining description and explanation succinctly—examiners reward clear, evidence‑based answers that integrate process, landform and example.
