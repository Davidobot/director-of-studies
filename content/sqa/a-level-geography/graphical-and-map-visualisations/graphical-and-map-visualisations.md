# Graphical presentation and map visualisations (scatter, kite, choropleth) (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why visualisation matters in geographic investigation
Clear graphical presentation and carefully designed map visualisations are central to communicating geographical research. Whether you are presenting field data from a river transect, comparing land-use distributions across a town, or testing hypotheses about relationships between variables, effective charts and maps make patterns, anomalies and spatial relationships visible. At Advanced Higher level you are expected not only to produce accurate visualisations, but to justify your choice of technique, to process data appropriately before plotting, and to interpret what the visualisation shows in relation to your research question. This chapter focuses on three commonly assessed techniques — scattergraphs, kite diagrams and choropleth maps — and situates them in the wider toolkit of mapping methods used in SQA assessments.

## Choosing the right visualisation: matching data, scale and question
The first decision in preparing any visualisation is whether your data and your question suit the technique. Nominal and categorical data are usually better represented by maps showing presence or categories, dot maps or proportional symbols, while ordinal and interval/ratio data lend themselves to choropleth mapping and scattergraphs. A scattergraph is appropriate when you want to test for a relationship between two interval variables, for example pebble size and distance downstream. A kite diagram (sometimes presented as a polar or radial chart) is useful for comparing multiple values for a single location or along a transect, such as size distributions of bedload at successive sampling points. Choropleth maps are best where you wish to show the spatial variation of a rate or density across areal units; they are not suitable for raw counts unless standardised, because area units differ in population or size. Always think: what is the message I want the reader to see? Let the question and the type of data guide the choice of visualisation.

## Scattergraphs: constructing, analysing and interpreting relationships
A scattergraph plots paired data points and is the textbook method for visualising bivariate relationships. Construction requires careful choice of axes, consistent units and, ideally, interval or ratio data. Place the independent or explanatory variable on the x‑axis and the dependent variable on the y‑axis, label both axes with units, and choose a scale that uses most of the plotting area without excluding values. When values vary across orders of magnitude, consider a logarithmic scale to linearise relationships and reduce heteroscedasticity. After plotting, add a line of best fit and consider statistical measures such as Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient for interval data or Spearman’s rank correlation for ordinal or non‑normal distributions. The strength and direction of a relationship are indicated by the correlation coefficient, while linear regression provides a gradient that can be interpreted in context. Always check for outliers, which may indicate measurement error or important exceptions worth investigating rather than simply removing. Annotate your graph to highlight clusters, trends and anomalies, and link interpretation to the hypothesis: for example, a strong negative correlation between boulder size and distance downstream supports a hypothesis that attrition reduces particle size.

## Kite diagrams: how to build, scale and read radial comparisons
Kite diagrams display multivariate data for a sequence of locations on a single chart and are especially useful in coastal and fluvial studies where distributions change along a transect. To construct a kite diagram plan the transect as a straight line and calculate the variable of interest at each sampling point, for example counts of pebble size classes or species abundance. The kite is built by plotting values perpendicular to a central axis for each class or sampling station; if comparing left and right sides of a channel, reflection around the central axis produces the kite shape. Key principles are consistent scaling on the radial axis so that visual comparisons reflect real differences, and ordering of size classes or categories so that adjacent sectors represent logically related values. Kite diagrams are excellent at showing dominance and symmetry: a large bulge on one side indicates concentration, while multiple peaks may reveal multimodal distributions or spatial variability. When preparing a kite for assessment, include clear legends and units, annotate major peaks and troughs, and, if appropriate, complement the kite with statistical summaries such as means and interquartile ranges to show dispersion.

## Choropleth maps: classification, normalisation and common pitfalls
Choropleth maps shade areas according to the magnitude of a variable and are commonly used to show rates such as population density, deprivation indices or percentage tree cover. The critical first step is normalisation so that the mapped value represents a rate or density rather than an absolute count; mapping raw counts by area can be misleading because larger or more populous units will appear more significant even when per‑unit values are low. Once normalised, choose a classification method carefully because it strongly affects the map’s message. Equal interval classes divide the data range into uniform steps and are useful for evenly distributed data; quantiles (equal counts per class) highlight relative differences but can exaggerate small absolute differences, while natural breaks (Jenks) group values at natural clusters in the data. Always include a clear legend with class boundaries, a succinct title that includes the unit (for example “Household income per 1000 population, 2019”), and a scale bar and north arrow for spatial context. Be aware of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP): the pattern you show can change if different boundary definitions are used. Avoid using too many classes, which confuses interpretation, and resist the temptation to use colour ramps that obscure differences; perceptually uniform colour schemes and colourblind‑friendly palettes are best practice. Finally, in reporting, explain the choice of normalisation and classification and discuss any spatial artefacts that may arise from the chosen areal units.

## Integrating graphs and maps with other mapping techniques
Maps and graphs should not sit in isolation in a report or exam answer. Complement choropleth maps with proportional Symbol maps, dot maps or flow lines when absolute magnitudes, exact counts or movements are also relevant. For field studies along transects, overlaying charted results onto an annotated overlay or cross‑section helps the examiner see how the quantitative results link to physical features. For example, pairing a transect kite diagram of pebble sizes with a cross‑section of channel form and a scattergraph of flow velocity versus pebble size ties process to pattern. Use inset maps to place a detailed study area within a wider atlas context. In exam responses where supplementary items are provided, reference these clearly and explain how the visualisation supports or contradicts theoretical models and prior research. Where appropriate, combine qualitative evidence from perception studies or interviews with quantitative maps, but make your conventions explicit so readers understand how the different data types were integrated.

## Presenting uncertainty, statistics and annotation effectively
Advanced Higher assessment expects you to treat uncertainty and statistics honestly. Alongside descriptive statistics such as mean, median and mode, include measures of dispersion (range, interquartile range, standard deviation) to show how variable the data are. Error bars on scattergraphs or bar charts communicate measurement uncertainty and increase credibility. When applying inferential tests such as chi‑squared, linear regression, Spearman’s or Pearson’s correlation, state the hypothesis being tested, the sample size and the level of significance used. In maps, include notes on data sources, dates and whether some areas had missing data. Annotation is not decorative: succinct labels, arrows pointing to key features and brief interpretive notes turn a good visual into persuasive evidence. Ensure that every map and graph has a descriptive caption that explains what is being shown, how it was calculated, and why it is relevant to the research question.

## Practical fieldwork and processing tips for clearer visuals
Good visualisations begin with robust data collection and tidy processing. Design sampling to match your intended analysis: random, regular or stratified strategies each have strengths; stratified sampling can help avoid dangerous or inaccessible areas while ensuring representative coverage. Record raw data carefully, noting units, timestamps and metadata. Before plotting, clean the dataset by checking for transcription errors, unrealistic outliers and missing values, and decide whether transformations such as logging are appropriate. When using software, spreadsheets are usually sufficient for scattergraphs and kite diagrams, while GIS is advisable for choropleth mapping and overlay work. If using an atlas to locate OS map extracts, ensure your scale and orientation match. For classroom practice, simulate large datasets and experiment with different classifications or scales to see how visual storylines change; this practice builds the judgement required in assessment.

## Exam technique
In an examination setting, start by identifying the command words and the data types involved. If asked to construct a graph or map, sketch the layout first, decide the most appropriate technique and state your justification briefly. For scattergraphs, label axes clearly, show units and, where required, draw a best fit line and comment on the correlation and its significance. For kite diagrams, sketch a clear transect and label sampling points; ensure radial scaling is consistent and explain what peaks indicate. For choropleth maps, state your normalisation method and classification choice before shading; include a neat legend and a brief comment on possible artefacts such as MAUP or boundary effects. Use annotations to link visual features to geographical theory or models and, where appropriate, refer to measures of central tendency and dispersion to support your interpretation. In longer answers, integrate visuals into a coherent argument: present results, evaluate methods and data quality, and conclude by relating findings to the original hypothesis or wider geographical implications. Time management is essential: allocate time to plan, draw clean visuals, and write concise interpretations and evaluations. Clear, well‑labelled figures plus focused commentary score highly because they show both technical skill and the ability to apply and evaluate geographical methods.
