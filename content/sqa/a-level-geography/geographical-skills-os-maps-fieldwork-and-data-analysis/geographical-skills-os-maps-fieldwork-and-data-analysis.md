# Geographical skills: OS maps, fieldwork and data analysis (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What these skills are and why they matter
Geographical skills bring classroom learning to life: they are the methods you use to observe the world, collect and evaluate evidence, and then turn that evidence into reasoned explanations. In the SQA Higher course these skills are assessed both in the question papers and through the assignment, so you need to be able to move comfortably between recognising features on an Ordnance Survey map, planning and carrying out small-scale fieldwork, processing numerical and graphical data, and drawing balanced conclusions. Practically, this means you will be expected to give clear map evidence (including six‑figure grid references), measure and describe relief and drainage, interpret photographs and sketches, construct and read graphs such as hydrographs and scatterplots, and evaluate the reliability and limitations of sources. Developing these skills helps you answer extended-response questions with confidence and produces stronger assignment work grounded in primary research.

## Ordnance Survey maps: reading, measuring and using map evidence
Ordnance Survey maps are a core assessment resource and a reliable way to present spatial information. When using an OS map you should be precise: give six‑figure grid references for exact locations, describe relief using contour patterns and spot heights, and identify drainage by naming rivers, noting stream patterns and giving evidence of direction of flow. Measuring distance accurately requires you to apply the map scale — convert centimetres on the map into metres or kilometres on the ground — and to remember that straight-line distance differs from route distance along paths or roads. When describing land use or sites for development, use map symbols and built-up patterns to justify your choices; for example, a location beside a minor road and near a cluster of services is more suitable for a small housing development than a steep, contoured slope with peat soil. Always include map evidence to back up assertions: a clear grid reference, a quoted contour interval, a named road or river, and directional language (north, east, along grid line) will lift your answer from general to specific. In practice, exam questions often ask you to integrate OS mapping with photographs and sketches, so practise matching upland ridge shapes and valley forms on the map to the features shown in images.

## Planning and carrying out fieldwork: design, sampling and safety
Good fieldwork begins with clear questions and a realistic plan. Your assignment or class investigation should start with a concise aim and testable hypotheses: for example, “Does impermeable urban surface cover increase peak flow in the local burn?” or “How does pebble size change along the beach profile?” From that starting point you choose methods that are appropriate, repeatable and safe. Sampling strategy matters: purposive sampling targets specific features, systematic sampling follows a fixed interval (every 50 m along a transect), and random sampling reduces bias. Each approach has strengths and limits; state your reason for the choice and acknowledge what it cannot show. Safety, permissions and consent are non-negotiable. You should carry out a risk assessment, seek landowner permission where required, and gain informed consent for interviews or questionnaires. During fieldwork, keep a contemporaneous record: raw data tables, labelled photographs with location and time, and clear sketches. These records form the Processed Information for the assignment and provide the primary evidence that underpins your conclusions. Teachers may give reasonable assistance during the research stage, but remember that the production of evidence is supervised and must be completed independently within the time allowed.

## Collecting, processing and analysing numerical and graphical data
Raw measurements become meaningful only when processed and analysed. Start by checking data quality: look for anomalous values, note any missing readings, and be aware of measurement uncertainty. Basic descriptive statistics — range, mean or median, and simple percentage change — help summarise patterns. Where appropriate, present data graphically: line graphs and hydrographs are effective for time-series data such as river level or discharge; bar charts and histograms display discrete comparisons; scatterplots reveal relationships between variables and allow you to judge the strength and direction of correlations by eye or with a line of best fit. Label axes with units, choose suitable scales to avoid distortion, and annotate graphs to highlight key features such as peak discharge or a point of inflection. When you calculate rates (for example, gradient as vertical change divided by horizontal distance), show your working so markers can follow your reasoning. Beyond description, analysis means explaining why patterns occur: link a steep short lag time on a hydrograph to impermeable urban surfaces and rapid runoff, or explain decreasing pebble size downdrift in terms of attrition and sorting by longshore drift. Always evaluate; comment on how representative your sample was, how reliable instruments were, and how seasonal variability might affect the results.

## Interpreting multiple sources: photographs, field sketches, transects and GIS
Most higher-level questions require synthesis of evidence from several sources, so practise reading composite evidence. A photograph gives a snapshot of landforms and land use, but the viewpoint and lens can exaggerate or compress relief; a field sketch, with clear annotations on scale, orientation and dominant features, compensates for this by noting textures, vegetation and human impact. Cross-sections and transects translate spatial variation into a linear profile: drawing a river channel or a cliff profile with accurate vertical relationships helps you explain processes of erosion and deposition. Use transect data to support claims about vegetation zonation, soil moisture change, or sediment size. Digital tools like Google Earth are acceptable for class work and can help visualise catchment-wide patterns; they are particularly useful for assignment research because they allow you to plot waypoints, embed photographs, and produce a .kmz tour that demonstrates understanding of physical context and human interventions. In exam answers, weave together map evidence, field observations and secondary data. A successful answer might begin with a labelled sketch or grid reference, use a photograph to illustrate current conditions, and then draw upon processed data to justify an evaluation of management strategies or process explanations.

## The assignment: research, Processed Information and controlled production
The SQA assignment is designed to test the full cycle of enquiry: identify a geographical topic or issue, research it (normally including fieldwork where appropriate), produce Processed Information, and then complete a timed production of evidence. The research stage is typically completed over about eight hours and may involve supervised fieldwork, library or online research, and interim checks by your teacher. You must submit Processed Information of no more than two single-sided A4 sheets (or one single-sided A3 sheet). This material is for your use during the 1 hour 30 minutes production stage; it must not contain a draft of your final report in any form. Centres may give reasonable assistance during research — guidance on methods, possible sources, or interim progress checks — but they must not direct you to specific resources, provide a topic, or give model answers. During the production stage you work independently under high supervision. Be aware of the penalties: failing to submit Processed Information attracts a deduction (six marks from the 30 available), so manage your materials carefully. For a strong assignment, focus your writing on a clear question, use both primary and secondary evidence, analyse data explicitly (with numerical support), reach a supported conclusion, and evaluate the reliability and limitations of the methods used.

## Putting theory into practice: applying skills in physical and human contexts
Practice applying the same core skills across different topics. In physical environments, use map and field evidence to explain landform genesis: draw an annotated diagram of a meander, show the processes of abrasion and hydraulic action, and use field pebble counts and OS map gradients to justify your interpretation. For hydrology, be able to annotate hydrographs with terms such as lag time, rising limb and peak flow and to explain human impacts such as urbanisation or deforestation. In human and global issues, apply statistical literacy to population pyramids and development indicators, explaining how different measures (GNI per capita, HDI, infant mortality) reveal different aspects of wellbeing and why a single indicator can mislead. When discussing management strategies — whether river basin works, coastal protection, or urban transport schemes — refer to specific case study evidence and evaluate both intended and unintended consequences. Wherever possible, anchor answers in named local or global examples; examiners reward specific, contextualised knowledge combined with well-explained geographical reasoning.

## Exam technique
Exams assess not only what you know but how you present it. Read each question carefully and underline command words: describe, explain, assess, evaluate and suggest each have different expectations. “Describe” asks for clear factual detail; “explain” requires causal chains linking cause and effect; “evaluate” or “assess” demands judgement supported by evidence and consideration of limitations. Start extended responses with a brief plan to ensure structure, then write clearly with paragraphs organised around one main idea each. In map-based questions always give precise map evidence: a six‑figure grid reference where appropriate, contour values, and named physical or human features. When answering skills-based questions, draw labelled diagrams or graphs if they help, and annotate them with brief explanations. For data questions, show essential calculations and highlight key statistics; for hydrographs and scatterplots, point to specific features and explain their causes and implications. Manage your time by allocating a few minutes at the start to plan and five minutes at the end to check: ensure units are included, grid references are correct, and any sketches are labelled. Use case studies from your course or assignment, but avoid vague generalities — a well-chosen local or global example used to illustrate a point is far more effective than several unsubstantiated references. Finally, ensure your conclusion answers the question directly: summarise the main evidence, state the degree of certainty in your judgement, and flag any significant limitations to your interpretation. This clear, evidence-led style will maximise the marks you gain for both skills and knowledge.
