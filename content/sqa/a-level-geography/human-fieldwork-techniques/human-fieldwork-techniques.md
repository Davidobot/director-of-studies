# Human fieldwork techniques (surveys, interviews, traffic, perception) (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction to human fieldwork techniques
Human fieldwork is the part of geography where enquiry moves out of the classroom and into real places, people and processes. At Advanced Higher level the emphasis is on designing investigations that answer complex questions, gathering primary data thoughtfully, and judging the strengths and weaknesses of the methods used. Human fieldwork techniques commonly include structured questionnaires, interviews, pedestrian and traffic counts, environmental quality surveys, land-use mapping and perception studies. Each technique collects a different kind of evidence and, when combined, they allow candidates to triangulate findings and reach well-evidenced conclusions for the project–folio and question paper. Good fieldwork links methods explicitly to a geographical hypothesis or question, justifies sampling and timing, and recognises ethical responsibilities and safety considerations.

## Planning, sampling and ethics
Effective human fieldwork begins with planning. The choice of question determines which techniques are appropriate. A clear, geographically framed hypothesis or set of enquiry questions helps identify the population, the spatial extent of study, and practical constraints such as time, access and safety. Sampling must be chosen to give valid, reliable and representative data: random sampling can reduce bias, systematic (regular) sampling suits transects and counts, and stratified sampling is useful where different land-use zones or demographic groups are known to exist. Sample size should be large enough to detect patterns but realistic given field constraints; piloting the survey or pilot counts helps estimate how long each observation takes and thus the feasible total sample.

Ethics and permissions are integral. Candidates must seek consent for interviews and surveys, explain the purpose of research, and protect anonymity when required. For school-organised fieldwork, teachers should ensure appropriate parental permissions, risk assessments and adherence to local safeguarding policies. Recording methods such as audio should be agreed in advance with respondents and devices secured responsibly. Evaluating the ethical dimension—was any group under-represented, were questions leading, did presence of the researcher influence behaviour—forms an important part of the final evaluation.

## Surveys and questionnaire design
Questionnaires are efficient for collecting structured information from many respondents and are well suited to studies of shopping behaviour, travel patterns, service use and perceptions of place. A carefully designed questionnaire balances closed questions, which are easy to code and quantify, with a small number of open questions to capture unexpected detail and nuance. Closed questions can use categorical responses or Likert-type scales to measure attitudes; these must be carefully worded so that response categories are exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Question order matters because earlier questions can prime later answers; a neutral opening question and logical grouping (background information, behaviour, attitudes) improves response quality.

Piloting is essential; a pilot will reveal ambiguous wording, timing issues, and whether the response options capture the full range of answers. Coding strategy should be decided before data collection so responses can be entered consistently. For classroom practice, a mix of face-to-face and online questionnaires is realistic, but candidates must note mode effects: online respondents may differ from those approached in the street. When using questionnaires in the project–folio, report both response rate and sampling procedure and justify how the sample supports broader conclusions.

## Interviews, focus groups and recording
Interviews give depth to human fieldwork and are particularly useful when exploring motivations, experiences and the reasoning behind behaviour that surveys cannot capture. Semi-structured interviews combine set questions with the freedom to probe promising lines of enquiry. Open-ended questions invite richer answers but require careful transcription and qualitative analysis. Focus groups can spark discussion and reveal social dynamics, but the group setting may bias some participants to conform.

Practicalities include preparing an interview schedule, ensuring ethical consent, choosing a quiet place to record, and using voice recorders or apps for accuracy. Notes taken immediately after an interview add context and reflexive comment on non-verbal cues and researcher influence. When analysing interview data, thematic coding helps identify recurring ideas and contrasting viewpoints; these qualitative findings should be linked back to quantitative results where possible to strengthen interpretation. For assessment, students should demonstrate how interviews complemented other techniques and comment on interviewer effects and reliability.

## Traffic and pedestrian studies
Traffic and pedestrian studies are straightforward to implement, highly visual to present, and directly relevant to urban geography, transport planning and accessibility issues. Counts of vehicles and people can be timed at chosen points and intervals to capture peak and off-peak patterns. Decisions about where to count are vital: sites should be chosen to test the hypothesis, and the times of day should reflect typical variation, such as morning and evening peaks or weekend versus weekday differences.

Counting methods vary from manual tally counters (clickers) to automated counters or video recordings for later analysis. Vehicle counts may be categorised by type to show freight versus commuter patterns, while pedestrian counts combined with origin–destination questioning can be used to map flows and spheres of influence. Recording delays and congestion can be complemented by time-in-queue or journey-time observations. When measuring noise in traffic studies, decibel meter apps can add a quantitative environmental quality dimension; again, document the device and calibration method. When presenting traffic data, flow line maps, time-series charts and proportional symbol maps communicate movement and intensity most effectively.

## Perception studies and mental mapping
Perception studies investigate how people experience and understand places, which is crucial when studying neighbourhood identity, fear of crime, or the attractiveness of shopping centres. Mental maps, sketch maps drawn by respondents, reveal perceived boundaries and landmarks and are valuable for comparing objective land-use mapping with subjective neighbourhood extents. Perception surveys can use Likert scales or ranking tasks to measure feelings about safety, cleanliness, accessibility or amenity provision.

Designing a perception study requires sensitivity because responses can relate to personal experience and social identity. Questions should avoid sensitive specifics unless handled with care and consent. Comparing the perceptions of different demographic groups reveals social gradients in experience; for example, older residents may rate accessibility differently to students. In analysis, present differences with clear summary statistics, and use thematic maps or annotated overlays to show how perceptions cluster spatially. Perception data often benefits most from mixed-methods presentation: quantitative summaries backed by verbatim quotes or illustrative mental maps.

## Data processing, statistics and mapping
The processing stage turns raw responses into evidence. Data cleaning includes checking for missing values, coding open responses, and ensuring consistent categorical labels. The type of data dictates the statistical tools: nominal data is suited to frequency counts and chi-squared tests for association; ordinal data, such as Likert scales, is commonly analysed with medians and non-parametric tests such as Spearman’s rank correlation; interval or ratio data, for example journey times or counts, can justify means, standard deviations and Pearson correlation or linear regression when underlying assumptions hold.

Descriptive statistics help summarise central tendency and dispersion, while graphical forms should be chosen to answer the geographic question. Scatterplots show relationships and are appropriate alongside correlation coefficients, while bipolar analyses and dispersion diagrams explore attitudes and variation. Mapping transforms data into spatial stories: choropleth maps display intensity by area, proportional symbols portray magnitude at points, transect diagrams illustrate change across space, and annotated overlays link new data to base OS mapping. Use of GIS or simple digital mapping can improve precision and presentation, but ensure any digital processing choices are explained and justified in the write-up.

Evaluation should attend to reliability (would a repeated study give the same results?), validity (does the method measure what it claims?), and sampling bias (who was missed?). Consider practical limitations such as weather, temporal variation, and researcher presence. A thoughtful evaluation concludes with clear suggestions for improvement: refining sampling, increasing sample size, improving question wording, using triangulation, or employing automated instruments for continuous measurement.

## Exam technique
When answering question-paper and coursework questions on human fieldwork techniques, start by reading the command words carefully and identify what the question asks: describe, explain, evaluate, justify or compare. For methodology questions, be precise about the what, where, when and how: name the technique, describe the sampling strategy and interval, justify why it is appropriate to the geographical question, and note practicalities such as timing, equipment and ethical consent. Examiners reward explicit linkages between method and geography—for example, explaining why stratified sampling along an urban transect will capture variations in land use and social indicators.

In data-handling answers, state the type of data and justify the chosen statistical tests. Explain why a Spearman’s rank is more appropriate than Pearson for ordinal responses, or why chi-squared testing can assess association in categorical variables. When interpreting graphs or maps, refer to specific patterns and consider anomalies; offer geographic explanations that draw on theory or models where relevant. For evaluation, move beyond listing limitations: assess how each limitation affects reliability and validity, and propose realistic improvements tied to time and resources.

In the project–folio, present methods and findings clearly and concisely. Include a short pilot summary, show sample size and response rate, and provide enough procedural detail that the study could be replicated. Use maps and diagrams to illustrate sampling locations and flows, and label statistical outputs clearly. Keep qualitative material focused: use selected, illustrative quotes rather than unfiltered transcripts. For both coursework and exams, time management is crucial: allocate time to planning answers, produce clear introductions and conclusions, and ensure that the final paragraph ties empirical evidence back to the original question. Demonstrating a considered, critical and geographically informed approach to human fieldwork is the most direct route to high marks.
