# Energy resources, demand and technologies (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction and overview
Energy lies at the heart of contemporary geography because it links physical resources, human development, technology and policy. At Higher level you are expected to understand where different energy resources are found, why patterns of demand are changing, and how technologies and management strategies are used to meet demand while responding to environmental and social concerns. Study should draw on local, national and international examples so you can explain processes, compare approaches and evaluate how well different strategies work in different contexts. Throughout, the concept of sustainable development should guide judgement: can energy needs be met now without compromising future generations?

## Global distribution of energy resources
The distribution of energy resources is uneven because of geology, climate and historical investment. Fossil fuels — coal, oil and natural gas — are concentrated where ancient organic deposits were buried and transformed under pressure and heat; large oil reserves are found in the Middle East, while coal is abundant in parts of Asia, North America and Australia. Uranium for nuclear power has its own geological hotspots. Renewable resources show different spatial patterns. Hydropower is concentrated in mountainous, wet regions such as Norway and parts of the Andes; geothermal energy is most viable in tectonically active regions like Iceland and parts of East Africa; wind resources are strongest on coastlines and uplands, illustrated by the extensive wind farms off the east coast of Scotland; and solar potential is greatest where insolation is high, such as in Mediterranean countries and desert regions. The result is that countries’ energy mixes reflect what is locally available as well as what they can afford to import, exploit or build infrastructure for. Understanding these patterns is crucial when you are asked to explain why one technology is used in one place but not another.

## Drivers of change in energy demand
Energy demand changes because of economic growth, population change, technology, lifestyle and policy. In developing countries, rapid industrialisation and urbanisation drive steep increases in demand as manufacturing grows and more households gain access to electricity. China’s dramatic rise in coal consumption during its industrial expansion is a clear example. In many developed countries, demand patterns are more complex: total energy use may plateau or fall because of efficiency improvements and deindustrialisation, yet electricity demand often rises as societies electrify transport and heating. Demographic shifts, such as ageing populations in parts of Europe, alter demand profiles for heating and services. Policy also shapes demand: carbon pricing, subsidies for renewables, building efficiency standards and transport planning can reduce fossil fuel use and encourage shifts to low-carbon energy. Social and cultural factors matter too; the acceptance of new technologies, such as electric vehicles or wind farms, influences how quickly transitions happen. When answering exam questions, be ready to explain both the physical and socio-economic factors behind demand change and to use concrete country examples to show how drivers interact.

## Non-renewable energy: benefits, limitations and management
Non-renewable sources — coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear — have powered the modern economy because they provide high energy density, dispatchable supply and established infrastructure. Oil remains vital for transport in many countries, while natural gas has been used as a ‘bridge fuel’ because it emits less CO2 per unit of energy than coal. Nuclear power supplies large amounts of low-carbon electricity in countries such as France but raises questions about radioactive waste, safety and decommissioning costs. Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) has unlocked shale gas and oil in places like the United States, changing global markets, but it has provoked controversy over seismic activity, groundwater contamination and local disruption. Non-renewable sources also create geopolitical tensions: countries with large reserves can influence global prices and geopolitics, producing both economic opportunities and dependencies. Management strategies for non-renewables include strategic reserves, regulation of extraction techniques, technologies to reduce emissions (such as carbon capture and storage) and careful planning to minimise environmental and social impacts. In evaluation, you should balance the reliability and economic advantages of non-renewables against environmental costs, security risks and long-term unsustainability.

## Renewable energy: technologies, strengths and trade-offs
Renewable energy technologies harness flows rather than stocks of energy and offer the promise of low-carbon, sustainable supply. Wind turbines convert kinetic energy into electricity and work well in coastal, upland and offshore locations; solar photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly and are modular, making them suitable for rooftop and utility-scale installations. Hydroelectric schemes, from small local schemes to major dams, store potential energy in reservoirs; pumped-storage hydropower is important for balancing intermittent supply. Geothermal supplies steady heat and electricity where subsurface heat is accessible. Marine technologies such as tidal barrages and wave devices have strong potential in exposed coastal zones. Bioenergy can recycle organic waste or produce fuel crops, though its sustainability depends on land use. Each technology has strengths: renewables reduce greenhouse gas emissions, can diversify supply and create local jobs. But they also have trade-offs. Intermittency of wind and solar requires storage or backup; large hydro can cause social displacement and ecosystem change; geothermal and marine power are geographically constrained; bioenergy can compete with food production. When evaluating renewables in an exam, consider both environmental and socioeconomic trade-offs, and explain why a technology might be suitable in one country but not in another — for example, large-scale solar is ideal in sun-rich, land-abundant countries, while Scotland’s windy coasts make offshore wind particularly appropriate.

## Systems, storage and technological integration
Delivering energy reliably and decarbonising supply requires more than generation technology: it requires systems thinking. Grids must balance supply and demand in real time, and national systems are evolving towards smarter, more flexible configurations. Energy storage is central to integrating intermittent renewables. Battery technologies are improving and becoming cheaper, enabling everything from household storage paired with rooftop solar to grid-scale battery installations. Pumped-storage hydropower remains a large-scale option for shifting energy across time by pumping water uphill when electricity is cheap and releasing it to generate when demand peaks. Emerging solutions include hydrogen as an energy carrier, which can store and transport energy produced from excess renewables and be used in industry or transport; power-to-gas systems; and advanced demand-management through smart meters and tariff structures that encourage off-peak use. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) aims to reduce emissions from fossil fuel plants but is still costly and not widely deployed. Decentralised generation, where communities and households generate some of their own energy, changes the social geography of energy and can increase resilience but raises regulatory and technical challenges. In your answers, explain how technologies combine to deliver reliable, affordable and lower-carbon energy and assess their feasibility in different economic and geographic contexts.

## Policy, economics and social considerations
Energy choices are shaped by policy and economics as much as physical geography. Subsidies, taxes, market design and international agreements influence investment in technologies. Policies such as feed-in tariffs, renewable obligations and auction systems have accelerated renewable deployment in many countries, while carbon pricing provides an economic signal to reduce emissions. Energy projects also have social dimensions: public acceptance, community benefits, landscape and cultural impacts, and distributional effects on fuel poverty or jobs in particular regions. The case of Germany’s Energiewende illustrates how ambitious policy can trigger rapid growth of renewables while also raising challenges over grid integration, costs and coal dependence for backup. In developing countries, affordability and access remain priorities; off-grid solar and micro-hydro can deliver electricity rapidly to remote communities, improving health and livelihoods. When evaluating management strategies, consider short-term costs versus long-term benefits, equity between different social groups, and how national capacity and governance affect outcomes.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on energy, begin by identifying the command word and tailoring your response accordingly. For describe and explain questions, open with a clear statement that defines the key terms and places the case in context. Use a relevant case study early to show concrete understanding, and integrate it into explanation rather than tacking it on at the end. For evaluative and discuss questions, balance strengths and weaknesses and make comparative judgements: show that you can weigh evidence and draw a justified conclusion. A useful structure for extended-response answers is: brief introduction that outlines your approach, a series of paragraphs each focusing on a single idea supported by evidence and example, and a concluding paragraph that answers the question directly and explains the relative merits of the options considered. Where data, maps or graphs are provided in the paper, use specific figures to support your points; a reference to a trend or an exact value strengthens an explanation. Time management is essential: for a 20-mark question, plan roughly five minutes to outline and structure your answer, allow 30–35 minutes to write, and reserve a few minutes to review and add linking phrases or a more precise conclusion. For the assignment, choose a focused question that can be researched feasibly, gather processed information carefully and make sure your final evidence is clearly argued, analytical and shows evaluation of methods and sources. Practise past papers and model answers to become familiar with expectations: clarity, use of geographical vocabulary, case study detail and critical evaluation will move your answers from descriptive to high-level analysis.
