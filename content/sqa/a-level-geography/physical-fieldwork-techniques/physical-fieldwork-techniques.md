# Physical fieldwork techniques (beach, river, soil, slope) (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: aims and approach to physical fieldwork
Physical fieldwork asks you to observe, measure and explain processes and patterns in the natural environment. Whether you are testing a hypothesis about how pebble size changes downstream, measuring beach profile changes after a storm, comparing soil moisture across a slope, or documenting evidence of soil creep, the purpose is the same: to collect reliable primary data, process it with appropriate methods, and use the results to reach evidence-based conclusions. Good fieldwork links a clear question to a justified method, shows awareness of sampling bias and error, and includes careful evaluation. Fieldwork should always be framed by a theoretical model or expectation (for example the downstream fining of sediment, or the lee-side accumulation of sand on a beach), because this lets you interpret your findings in a broader geographical context.

## Planning and sampling design
A successful study begins with planning. Clarify the question you want to answer and identify the variables you will measure. Choose sites that are representative of the process you want to study and consider scale: local snapshots are useful for process-based questions, while transects and multiple sites give stronger evidence about spatial change. Sampling strategy is critical for valid results. Systematic sampling along a transect is useful for measuring change, random sampling avoids investigator bias, and stratified sampling is valuable when the landscape has clear sub-areas (for example upper, middle and lower slope). Always think about replication: repeated measurements increase confidence and allow calculation of dispersion. Time also matters; diurnal and seasonal cycles can affect temperature, discharge and moisture, so record the timing of all field measurements and, where possible, repeat visits to capture variability. Finally, secure permissions, consider access logistics, and prepare a risk assessment so that the practicalities of reaching and working at the site do not undermine the quality of your data.

## Beach techniques: profiles, sediments and interpretation
Beach studies commonly measure morphology and sediment characteristics to understand coastal processes. A beach profile captures the gradient from low water to the backshore and can be measured quickly using a clinometer or a simple ranging pole-and-tape method. Repeated profiles before and after a storm provide direct evidence of erosion or accretion. Sediment studies combine pebble analysis and grain-size measurement. Pebble angularity and size can be recorded using calipers and pebble size charts or by sieving sand samples to generate median grain sizes. Recording pebble lithology and rounding gives clues about transport history and energy levels; for example, well-rounded quartz pebbles suggest prolonged transport and high energy. When interpreting beach data, relate measured profiles and sediment distributions to process drivers such as wave energy, wind direction and longshore drift. Comparing beaches with different fetch or human modifications (groynes, seawalls) is an effective way to discuss the role of both natural and engineered controls on coastal morphology.

## River techniques: cross-sections, discharge and sediment transport
River fieldwork explores how channel form and flow vary along the course. Building cross-sections by measuring depth at regular intervals across a channel and recording width produces the cross-sectional area needed to estimate discharge. Velocity can be measured directly using a flow meter or with a floating object timed over a measured distance; combining mean velocity and cross-sectional area gives discharge. Wetted perimeter and channel roughness observations help explain differences between calculated and expected discharge. Pebble size sampling across the channel and along the length of the stream shows patterns of downstream fining and lateral sorting. Measuring bed material, bank material and evidence of erosion or deposition offers insights into contemporary geomorphic activity. When designing river studies, consider safety first: avoid fast-flowing or deep sections for inexperienced teams, and use multiple replicates to reduce measurement error. In analysis, scattergraphs of pebble size against distance downstream, and cross-section plots of depth and flow, help demonstrate relationships and test hypotheses such as the reduction of grain size with downstream distance.

## Soil techniques: profiles, pH, moisture and texture
Soil fieldwork combines observational description with quantitative measurement. Digging a soil pit or trench reveals horizons which you should describe in terms of colour, texture, structure and organic content. Measure humus depth and note mottling or signs of waterlogging. pH testing can be done with field test kits or electronic probes; where probes are used, regular calibration is essential. Soil moisture can be estimated with portable moisture meters but for rigorous results collect samples to calculate gravimetric moisture content by weighing, oven-drying and reweighing. Texture can be assessed by hand (the feel test) or more precisely by sieving and sedimentation methods, and bulk density can be calculated by collecting a core of known volume. In upland or sloping environments, measuring soil depth and humus accumulation along a transect helps explain patterns of soil development and the role of slope position in soil erosion and deposition. Always protect soil pits and replace vegetation where required; leave minimal disturbance and record GPS locations for reproducibility.

## Slope techniques: transects, gradient and evidence of mass movement
Slope studies look at form and process along a slope transect. Gradient is a primary measurement and can be obtained with a clinometer, an abney level or simple tape-and-level methods. Along the transect, measure humus depth, soil moisture, pH and vegetation cover, and note features such as terracettes, scarps or tension cracks that indicate creep or more rapid mass movement. Small-scale erosion can be monitored by placing fixed markers or erosion pins and measuring vertical change over time; for longer-term studies repeat surveys capture cumulative movement. Relate measurements to slope processes: increased moisture and shallow soils may indicate higher susceptibility to landslip, while vegetation type and root structure influence slope stability. Where appropriate, combine slope data with rainfall records or drainage patterns to discuss triggering factors. Accurate mapping of slope features using annotated sketches or GPS-assisted transects improves the spatial analysis and strengthens links between measured variables and geomorphic models.

## Data handling, statistical techniques and mapping
Field data are only as valuable as the way they are processed and presented. Clear and legible field notebooks and consistent digital data entry reduce transcription errors; always record units, instrument precision and any anomalies at the time of collection. Use descriptive statistics such as mean, median and mode to summarise central tendency and range, interquartile range or standard deviation to describe dispersion. Choose inferential tests that suit your data: Spearman’s rank is appropriate for ordinal or non-normally distributed data, Pearson’s product-moment for continuous variables that meet parametric assumptions, and chi-squared for categorical comparisons. Graphical presentation should match the question you want to answer: boxplots and dispersion diagrams show variability and outliers, scatterplots assess correlation and form the basis for regression analysis, transect profiles and cross-sections visualise spatial change, and kite diagrams are useful for displaying comparative distributions. Mapping adds geographic context; transect overlays, choropleth shading for intensity variables, proportional symbols for counts or rates, and flow-line maps for movement all help you to synthesise the spatial component of your fieldwork. Always annotate graphs and maps thoroughly, include scales and units, and where statistical tests are used, report both the statistic and a statement about significance in plain language.

## Practicalities: equipment, safety and ethical considerations
Practical preparation underpins reliable fieldwork. Check and calibrate equipment such as clinometers, pH meters and anemometers before deployment, and carry spare batteries and tapes. A standard kit should include safety equipment, first-aid, suitable clothing, GPS or maps for navigation, waterproof notebooks, camera and labelled sample bags. Team roles improve efficiency: designate a recorder, a safety officer and specific measurement duties, and ensure everyone understands the sampling protocol to maintain consistency. Safety considerations include assessing access routes, avoiding hazardous terrain and fast-flowing water, and having contingency plans for sudden weather changes. Ethically, reduce environmental impact by refilling pits, avoiding disturbance to wildlife and private property, and anonymising personal information collected in human surveys. Thoughtful recording of uncertainties, instrument limitations and the timing of measurements strengthens the credibility of your study and shows mature scientific reasoning.

## Exam technique
In exams you will be required to describe methods, justify choices, interpret data and evaluate techniques. When answering method or planning questions, begin by stating a clear, concise aim and link it directly to the variables you will measure. Justify your sampling strategy and explain why it is suitable for the spatial and temporal scales of the question. Use specific field details: describe instruments, measurement intervals, methods of replication and safety measures. For data-handling questions, choose graphs and statistics that match the data type and explicitly explain what each technique reveals about your hypothesis. When interpreting results, quote quantitative evidence and relate it to the theoretical model you introduced. Evaluation should be balanced: identify limitations such as sample size, measurement precision, access constraints or temporal variability, then suggest realistic improvements such as increased replication, alternative instruments, or stratified sampling. In map interpretation and data analysis answers, reference the map or dataset features clearly and integrate your field methods with broader geographic processes to show synthesis. Remember the familiar three-part structure: describe what you did or see, explain why it matters, and evaluate how reliable or representative it is. Using this structure consistently, and grounding every claim in measured evidence or a clear logical step, will make your exam answers precise, credible and exam-board ready.
