# Critical evaluation of sources and geographical issues (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: what critical evaluation means in geography
Critical evaluation in geography is the disciplined process of interrogating information so that your judgements about places, processes and policies are grounded in evidence and reason. At Advanced Higher level this moves beyond description: you are expected to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different sources, weigh competing viewpoints, and synthesise those judgements to reach reasoned conclusions. The geographical issue task on the project–folio requires you to choose a current, complex topic, gather relevant sources, summarise at least three distinct viewpoints, and then evaluate each viewpoint in terms of balance, credibility and evidence. This section explains how to do that clearly and consistently so your work meets the standards expected by the Scottish Qualifications Authority.

## Types of sources and how to read them
Sources in geography come in many forms and each type demands a slightly different reading approach. Academic journal articles and research reports are usually peer-reviewed and contain explicit methods, data and literature context; treat them as high-value evidence but check the methodology and sample sizes. Government and agency reports often provide large datasets and policy statements; note their purpose and the institutional perspective. Media articles and blogs are useful for current debate and public opinion but are more likely to be selective and geared to an audience. Maps, aerial photographs, satellite imagery and statistical datasets are primary forms of spatial evidence; examine their scale, date, projection and collection methods because these determine their applicability. Interviews, surveys and field notebooks represent primary qualitative or quantitative data; evaluate how the data were gathered, who was sampled and how representative the results are. Learning to read each form with an eye for who produced it, why, when and how will help you judge its usefulness in addressing your geographical issue.

## Summarising viewpoints without losing nuance
A well-executed geographical issue must begin with concise, accurate summaries of the main viewpoints you have selected. Each summary should capture the central claim of the source and the key evidence or reasoning that supports it. Avoid paraphrasing so closely that you merely reproduce the source; instead, distil its argument in your own words and make clear which aspects are opinion, which are inference, and which are supported by data. When summarising a scientific paper, draw out the stated hypothesis, the methods used and the main findings. When summarising a policy document or NGO briefing, explain the recommended action and the rationale offered. Keep each summary focused and balanced so you can later compare like with like. The specification expects at least three substantive viewpoints; choose sources that together show a range of evidence, methods and interpretations so your evaluation has depth and genuine contestability.

## Criteria for evaluating sources and viewpoints
A systematic set of evaluation criteria will make your assessments consistent and persuasive. First consider credibility: who is the author, what are their qualifications, and what motivations might influence their perspective? Next assess balance: does the source present evidence for and against its position or does it selectively emphasise one side? Then examine methodology and representativeness: for empirical studies, were appropriate sampling methods and statistical tests used; for fieldwork evidence, were procedures described clearly so findings could be replicated; for maps and remote sensing, was scale and date appropriate to the question? Currency matters in many contemporary topics, so check when data were collected and whether conditions have changed since. Finally, test the internal logic and external corroboration: are the conclusions logically supported by the evidence within the source, and do independent sources agree or contradict those findings? Discussing limitations is as important as noting strengths; a source that clearly acknowledges uncertainty and methodological constraints can be more reliable than one that asserts certainty without evidence.

## Corroboration and weighting evidence
Good critical evaluation treats evidence like pieces in a puzzle rather than a series of isolated statements. Triangulation, the process of corroborating claims across different types of sources and methods, strengthens your argument. If government statistics, independent research and field observations point to the same conclusion, that conclusion is more robust. Where sources disagree, look for reasons: differences in scale, time period, sampling, definitions or vested interests often explain apparent contradictions. Weighting evidence means explaining why one source should carry more influence in your judgement. A large, well-designed statistical study may outweigh a small local survey, while an in-depth qualitative interview might provide insights that explain patterns seen in numeric data. Make explicit in your writing why you assign relative weight to sources so your conclusions are transparent and justifiable.

## Applying evaluation to geographical issues and examples
To make the process concrete, consider some typical Advanced Higher topics. In evaluating arguments about coastal management, check whether studies use up-to-date shoreline mapping, whether beach profile measurements have appropriate repeat samples, and whether economic assessments include long-term maintenance costs. In debates over fracking, examine the independence of environmental impact assessments, the sampling of groundwater quality, and the temporal scale of seismic records. For urban regeneration projects, compare municipal policy documents with resident perception surveys and independent housing market data, and be alert to differences in spatial scale between neighbourhood studies and city-wide statistics. In each case, link evidence to geographical theory where appropriate: use concepts such as spatial scale, systems thinking, and human–environment interaction to explain why a particular piece of evidence matters to your conclusion.

## Planning, presentation and academic conventions
Effective evaluation is embedded in sound planning and presentation. Begin by defining a clear, focused question that is narrow enough to handle in the permitted word count but broad enough to require analysis and judgement. Keep a research log that records sources consulted, dates accessed, and brief annotations about relevance and reliability; this log becomes the basis of your bibliography and shows the journey of your thinking. Present your material in a structured way that guides the reader from context and summaries through critical evaluation to a reasoned conclusion. Use referencing consistently and accurately so readers can verify your sources and so that you avoid plagiarism. Remember the formal requirements: the geographical issue must be within the word limit, summaries of at least three viewpoints are required, and conclusions should be evidence-based rather than merely opinion. Clear presentation, including legible figures and well-labelled maps, enhances the credibility of your evaluation.

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
Students often fall into predictable errors when evaluating sources. One common problem is conflating bias with invalidity; every source has a perspective, but a biased source can still contain useful data if its limitations are acknowledged. Avoid relying on a narrow range of easily accessible sources; breadth of evidence is essential. Overreliance on uncritically quoted statistics or long quotations diminishes your own analytical voice; paraphrase and integrate evidence tightly into your argument. Another mistake is failing to consider scale and temporal mismatch: comparing local observations with national statistics without noting the difference can lead to false conclusions. Finally, weak conclusions that merely restate a favored source do not meet the standard of critical evaluation. Counter these problems by explicitly discussing limitations, triangulating evidence, and ensuring your synthesis is an independent judgement built from multiple lines of support.

## Exam technique
In the question paper and the project–folio you are assessed on map interpretation, gathering and processing techniques, data handling, and critical evaluation. For timed examinations, allocate your time so you complete each question and leave a final review. In map questions, annotate the Ordnance Survey extract with clear references to scale, relief, and mapped symbols, and use the atlas when asked to place the extract in a broader context. When asked about gathering or processing techniques, briefly state the sampling strategy, justify its appropriateness, discuss reliability and ethical considerations, and suggest realistic improvements. For data handling tasks, start by describing the data type and sampling method, choose descriptive or inferential statistics that suit the hypothesis, and interpret the results in geographical terms rather than as abstract numbers. In the project–folio, plan stages with deadlines, document your fieldwork and literature search, and keep careful records to authenticate your work. When writing your critical evaluation, begin with succinct summaries of the chosen viewpoints, evaluate each systematically using the criteria of credibility, balance, methodology, currency and corroboration, and end with a balanced conclusion that draws on all sources. Always reference accurately and stay within word limits, because penalties apply for significant over-length. Above all, show your examiner the chain of reasoning from source, through critique, to conclusion; that is what distinguishes descriptive work from the level of critical evaluation expected at Advanced Higher.
