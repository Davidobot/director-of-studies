# Atmosphere: energy and circulation (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: why energy and circulation matter
The atmosphere’s patterns of energy receipt and redistribution underpin almost every aspect of climate and weather that we study in geography. Energy from the Sun is the ultimate driver of atmospheric motion, ocean currents and the distribution of climatic zones, while the ways that the atmosphere and oceans move that energy determine where heat and moisture are concentrated or lost. For Higher/A-level study you need to be able to describe the components of the global heat budget, explain the physical processes that control how much energy reaches and leaves the Earth’s surface, and show how atmospheric and oceanic circulation redistribute energy on a planetary scale. As you learn, keep linking processes to clear examples — the Hadley cell and trade winds, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic climate, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and West African rainfall are convenient anchors for explanation and assessment.

## The global heat budget and latitudinal variation in energy
The global heat budget is a simple but powerful idea: over the long term the Earth receives approximately as much energy from the Sun as it emits back to space. Incoming solar radiation arrives mainly as shortwave radiation and is distributed unevenly because of Earth’s curvature and the angle of incidence. Near the equator solar rays strike more directly and over a smaller area, producing a surplus of incoming energy. Toward the poles the same amount of incoming energy is spread over a larger area and is received at a low angle, creating a deficit. Several surface and atmospheric processes modify this basic pattern. A proportion of incoming solar radiation is reflected to space by clouds, aerosols, and surface features; this is the planet’s albedo and is especially high where ice and snow persist. Some shortwave energy is absorbed in the atmosphere by gases and particulates; most passes to the surface where it warms land and oceans. The warmed surface emits longwave (infrared) radiation upward. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-radiate some of this longwave energy, reducing net loss to space and raising the surface temperature compared to what it would be without an atmosphere. Understanding these components — incoming shortwave, reflected shortwave, absorbed shortwave, outgoing longwave and the role of atmospheric absorption and re-radiation — allows you to explain why the tropics have an energy surplus while polar regions have a deficit, and why climate zones are arranged as they are.

## Atmospheric processes controlling receipt and loss of radiation
Several atmospheric processes affect the amount of energy that reaches the surface and that escapes back to space. Scattering by molecules and aerosols spreads incoming radiation and influences the diffuse component of daylight; absorption by ozone and water vapour removes specific wavelengths before they hit the ground. Cloud cover is particularly important because it has a dual effect: low, thick clouds tend to reflect large amounts of incoming shortwave radiation, cooling the surface, whereas high, thin clouds are efficient at trapping outgoing longwave radiation and so have a net warming effect. Surface characteristics also alter receipt: dark, vegetated surfaces absorb more energy than pale, icy surfaces, so regional contrasts in albedo can reinforce temperature contrasts. Feedbacks amplify some effects: for example, melting ice reduces albedo and causes further warming, contributing to polar amplification where warming is greater at high latitudes than the global average.

## Atmospheric circulation: cells, winds and energy redistribution
Energy imbalances drive large-scale atmospheric circulation. Heat rises where the surface is warm and sinks where it is cool; because the Earth rotates, these vertical motions are organised into three broad meridional cells in each hemisphere: the Hadley cell in the tropics, the Ferrel cell in mid-latitudes, and the Polar cell near the poles. In the Hadley cell warm equatorial air rises, expands and cools, producing convection and heavy rainfall around the equator. That air diverges aloft and moves polewards, subsides around 30° latitude, and creates belts of high pressure and aridity. The descending air then returns equatorwards near the surface as the trade winds, which in combination with the Coriolis effect blow from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. The Ferrel cell is driven more indirectly by the convergence of air between the Hadley and Polar circulations and is associated with the prevailing westerlies that dominate most temperate zones. The Polar cell contains cold, dense air that descends at high latitudes and flows equatorwards as polar easterlies. These cell structures and associated surface wind patterns are essential for redistributing heat polewards and for shaping regional climates; for example, the trade winds push warm surface waters westward across ocean basins, while mid-latitude westerlies steer depression tracks and the transfer of heat and moisture into continental interiors.

## Oceanic circulation and coupled air–sea processes
Oceans move vast amounts of heat and are an essential partner to the atmosphere in the global redistribution of energy. Surface ocean currents are primarily wind-driven and form major gyres in each major basin, such as the North Atlantic Gyre, in which the Gulf Stream carries warm tropical waters northward along the US east coast and then eastwards to form the North Atlantic Drift that moderates north-western Europe’s climate. Ekman transport — the net movement of surface water at right angles to the wind due to Coriolis deflection — leads to convergence and divergence zones that cause coastal upwelling or downwelling; where upwelling occurs, cold deep waters rise and suppress local air temperatures while supporting productive fisheries, as off the coast of Peru. At greater depth, thermohaline circulation, driven by density differences related to temperature and salinity, forms the so-called global conveyor belt. This deep circulation transfers heat slowly but persistently across basins and ties regional climates together on long timescales. Ocean–atmosphere coupling also produces interannual variability; ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) events, for example, alter sea surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation patterns across the Pacific and beyond, with knock-on effects for rainfall and storminess in many regions.

## The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ): causes, characteristics and impacts
The ITCZ is a migrating belt of low pressure and intense convection near the thermal equator where trade winds from both hemispheres converge. It forms because solar heating is strongest in the tropics, driving persistent uplift, cloud formation and heavy precipitation. The ITCZ migrates seasonally following the zone of maximum heating and the thermal equator, moving north in the Northern Hemisphere summer and south in the Southern Hemisphere summer. Over West Africa this migration is the core driver of the West African monsoon: the northward shift of the ITCZ in boreal summer brings moist, maritime tropical air onto the continent, producing a wet season that is crucial for agriculture. When the ITCZ withdraws southward in winter, arid conditions return across the Sahel and Sahara. The timing and strength of ITCZ migration control the onset and length of rainy seasons; a delayed or weak northward shift can cause droughts, while an unusually vigorous shift can lead to flooding. In river basins across West Africa these seasonal pulses of rainfall produce clear seasonal hydrographs with high peak flows during the wet months and low flows in the dry season. Understanding the ITCZ therefore links atmospheric circulation to hydrology and human livelihoods, making it a frequent focus of exam questions and case studies.

## Linking processes to impacts and real-world examples
In exams you will be expected to move from process to consequence, so practise building coherent chains of explanation. For example, you can explain how a surplus of solar energy in the tropics sets up strong convective uplift, which feeds the Hadley circulation and, together with the trade winds, drives westward surface ocean currents forming warm pools in the western Pacific. These warm pools, in turn, influence atmospheric pressure patterns and rainfall distributions. Another useful line of argument is to show how ocean currents affect regional climates: the Gulf Stream transports heat northwards, elevating air temperatures and modifying the European thermal regime compared with other locations at the same latitude. Conversely, upwelling off western continental margins pulls cool water to the surface, stabilising the lower atmosphere and often creating arid coastal deserts beyond. When using examples, be precise about spatial or temporal scales and state clearly the mechanisms that connect cause and effect; exam answers that skip steps or rely only on assertion will score less well than answers that trace a clear physical link.

## Exam technique
Exam questions on atmosphere, energy and circulation reward clear definitions, structured explanation and application to named examples. Begin longer answers by defining key terms such as the global heat budget, Hadley cell, albedo or ITCZ, then outline the sequence of processes in logical steps: cause, mechanism, result. Where appropriate, sketch and label simple diagrams mentally or on the answer paper — for example a cross-section of a Hadley cell showing rising air at the equator and subsidence at 30° — and use the diagram to guide your verbal explanation. Always include at least one specific example to illustrate your point; examiners look for application, so naming the Gulf Stream, the West African monsoon, Peru upwelling or ENSO strengthens your answer. For comparison questions, discuss contrasts in process or effect and explain why they occur, using the energy budget or different circulation regimes as the explanatory basis. When asked to evaluate or assess effectiveness, weigh positive and negative consequences and discuss limitations or uncertainties, such as how cloud feedbacks complicate predictions of future energy balance. Time management matters: allocate roughly one third of your answer to description and explanation, one third to application (examples, case studies), and one third to analysis or evaluation where required. Finally, practise past paper questions and get comfortable translating maps, graphs and hydrographs into process-based explanations; being able to interpret a hydrograph in terms of seasonal ITCZ migration or monsoon onset is a common way to connect atmospheric circulation to local impacts and will be rewarded in exam answers.
