# GIS and atlas use for spatial analysis (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why GIS and atlases matter in Advanced Higher Geography
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and atlases are complementary tools that every Advanced Higher geographer should be comfortable with. GIS allows you to combine, visualise and analyse spatial datasets in ways that make complex patterns obvious and testable, while an atlas provides authoritative, thematic and contextual background that helps place local observations into national and global frames. For course assessment and the project–folio you will be expected to use both: GIS to process and present evidence, and an atlas to locate your OS map extract, supply supporting statistics and help interpret processes such as climate, population distribution or transport networks. Understanding what each tool can do, and the limitations of the data you use, strengthens fieldwork design, data handling, map interpretation and the critical evaluation required at Advanced Higher level.

## GIS fundamentals every candidate should know
At its simplest, GIS stores spatial features together with attributes and displays them as layers you can switch on and off. There are two basic data types: vector data represents discrete features such as points (sample sites), lines (roads, river channels) and polygons (land-use areas), while raster data represents continuous surfaces such as elevation (DEMs), temperature or satellite imagery. Every dataset has a coordinate reference system (CRS) or datum. In the UK the Ordinance Survey National Grid (OSGB36 / British National Grid) is standard for mapping and for 1:25,000 OS Explorer extracts; GPS devices and many global datasets use WGS84. For accurate spatial analysis, convert datasets to a consistent projection that minimises distortion for your study area. Good practice in GIS also includes recording metadata: who collected the data, when, how accurate it is, and any processing steps. These details are essential to justify methodological choices in the project–folio and to evaluate reliability.

## Key GIS analytical techniques useful for Advanced Higher projects
GIS can perform many types of spatial analysis that directly match Advanced Higher requirements. Overlay analysis lets you combine layers — for example, intersecting flood extents with land-use to identify vulnerable assets. Buffering creates zones around features such as 100 m buffers around river channels to study adjacent land-use change or vegetation. Surface analysis from a DEM produces slope, aspect and hillshade maps useful for explaining micro-climate, soil erosion or vegetation patterns. Interpolation techniques (inverse distance weighting, kriging) turn point measurements of variables such as pebble size, pH or temperature into continuous surfaces for visual comparison. Kernel density and hotspot analysis reveal clustering of human phenomena such as crime, litter or pedestrian flows and can be used alongside nearest neighbour or spatial autocorrelation methods to test whether patterns are random, clustered or regular. Spatial joins and zonal statistics allow you to summarise attribute data by areas, for example calculating mean census variables within electoral wards or service areas to create choropleth maps. Always state the rationale for the technique you choose: explain why buffering or kriging is appropriate for the question and what assumptions are involved.

## Integrating GIS with fieldwork and data quality considerations
GIS is most powerful when combined with careful field data collection. Modern smartphones with GPS or handheld units allow you to capture accurate point data and attach photographs and attribute forms, reducing transcription errors. When planning fieldwork, think about sampling strategy: random, systematic (regular), stratified or purposive sampling all have different strengths and weaknesses for validity and representativeness. Record uncertainties in measurements, instrument precision and timing; note factors that might bias results such as weather conditions, tide state for coastal work, or traffic flow times for urban surveys. Ingest your field data into GIS with clear attribute fields and consistent units, and check for outliers or recording mistakes before analysis. When using secondary datasets, inspect source quality, scale and date: a national land-cover map from ten years ago may not reflect a recent housing development. In the project–folio you must evaluate data reliability, discuss any limitations, and show how these influence conclusions.

## Atlas use: locating, contextualising and supporting analysis
An atlas suitable for SCQF level 7 is an examination requirement and a vital revision resource. Use the atlas index and grid references to place your 1:25,000 OS extract within a wider geographical context, identifying nearby towns, transport corridors, relief features and regional land-use patterns. Thematic atlas maps provide quick access to population distribution, climate normals, economic activity, road and rail density, and land cover, all of which are useful background when justifying case-study selection or explaining observed patterns. Atlases are also valuable for comparing scales: some processes visible on a 1:25,000 sheet (field boundaries, individual buildings) become clearer at regional or national scales when you look for broader drivers such as urban hierarchy or regional climatic gradients. In an exam, reference to atlas evidence demonstrates wider knowledge and can strengthen map interpretation answers, for example by linking local drainage patterns on the OS extract to regional rainfall or geology shown in an atlas.

## Presenting spatial results: cartography, classification and statistical choices
Good maps are legible, honest and purpose-driven. Every map you present, whether in the exam or in your folio, should have a clear title that tells the reader what is being shown, a neat legend explaining symbols and classes, an indication of scale, and a north arrow where orientation matters. When producing choropleth maps or classified rasters, explain and justify the classification method you used. Quantile (equal-count), equal-interval, natural breaks (Jenks) and standard deviation each emphasise different aspects of a distribution; choose the method that best communicates the pattern without misleading the reader. For proportionate symbol, flow or isoline maps, ensure symbols are scaled appropriately and that flow arrows indicate direction as well as magnitude. When performing statistical tests, report the test used and why it is appropriate for your data type, for example using Spearman’s rank for ordinal data or Pearson’s product-moment for interval data with a linear relationship. Provide descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to summarise datasets and include measures of dispersion to show variability. In your folio, embed GIS outputs as figures with concise captions, reference the data sources and software used, and annotate maps to highlight the specific evidence supporting your argument.

## Practical applications: example projects and how GIS/atlas complement them
GIS and atlas use can strengthen a wide range of Advanced Higher project types. In a river study investigating boulder size downstream, digitise transect points and attribute boulder measurements, then use scatterplots and regression to test for correlation with distance and velocity. Use transect overlays and cross-section graphics produced from GIS to present spatial variation visually, and an atlas to locate the river within regional rainfall and land-use context. For an urban transect or environmental quality survey, combine field-collected noise and litter data with OS-based land-use polygons and census-derived population density from an atlas or national dataset. Create choropleth maps of service provision or travel-to-work flows and use kernel density to show hotspots of pedestrian activity. When evaluating a geographical issue, such as the viability of new housing development on an urban fringe, combine site-scale OS evidence with GIS suitability analysis (overlaying slope, flood risk, road access) and atlas context on regional housing demand and transport networks. Throughout, explain methodological choices, acknowledge limitations and suggest how further GIS analysis or ground-truthing could strengthen conclusions.

## Exam technique
When answering the question paper, manage your time so you can show both technical skill and evaluative insight. For map interpretation questions, begin by orienting the extract: identify scale, dominant land uses, settlement hierarchy, transport features and relief. Use precise OS references and compass directions when describing locations and changes. When asked to integrate atlas evidence, explicitly state which atlas map or statistic you used and how it contextualises the OS extract — for example, linking a local river channel pattern to broader precipitation or geology shown in an atlas. For gathering and processing technique questions, be specific: describe the sampling method, the instruments, how you minimised bias and how you processed raw data (for example, calculating means for transect bands or using standard deviation to quantify variability). If the question requires evaluation, assess strengths and weaknesses of your chosen method and suggest realistic improvements.

In data handling questions, always state the data type (nominal, ordinal, interval), justify your choice of graphical method (scattergraph for relationships, kite diagram for size distribution along a transect, boxplot to show dispersion), and explain the statistical test you would apply and why (for example, use Spearman’s rank if the data are ordinal or if assumptions of normality are violated). Show numerical working where required and interpret results in geographical terms: a correlation coefficient is not meaningful on its own unless you say what it implies about the process being studied.

For the project–folio, integrate GIS outputs carefully but sparingly within the word count. Use maps, graphs and tables as evidence rather than padding; annotate figures and refer to them in the text to support arguments. Keep track of word limits and submit accurate word counts. Document metadata and ethical considerations, for example anonymising interview responses. In the geographical issue, when critically evaluating sources, explicitly discuss the balance, credibility and potential bias of each viewpoint, and use atlas material to corroborate or challenge assertions.

Remember command words: describe requires structured observation and detail, explain requires causes or mechanisms, evaluate requires balanced judgement and justification with evidence, and justify requires clear, evidence-based reasons for choices. Where possible quantify your descriptions (distances, percentages, mean values) and always tie methods and results back to geographical theory or models to show higher-order understanding.

Finally, practise with past papers and specimen questions, making sure the atlas you use in the exam is the clean, general atlas required by SQA. In the exam, annotate your atlas references neatly so the marker can see the connection between your OS map analysis and wider spatial patterns. By combining rigorous field methods, thoughtful GIS analysis, and well-chosen atlas evidence, you will produce the coherent, evaluative responses expected at Advanced Higher level.
