# Geographical project skills: planning, presentation and referencing (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Purpose and approach of the project–folio
The project–folio at Advanced Higher level tests your ability to carry out independent geographical research and to communicate it in a clear, evidence-based way. It consists of two complementary pieces of work: a geographical study (an independent research investigation, often involving fieldwork) and a geographical issue (a critical evaluation of a current, complex geographical question using at least three sources). Together these assessments require you to demonstrate topic selection and justification, careful planning, competent data gathering, appropriate processing and analysis, balanced evaluation of sources, and a professional standard of presentation and referencing. As you prepare, treat the folio as a mini-research project: pose a clear question, gather appropriate evidence, apply the right methods, and reach reasoned conclusions supported by your data and wider reading.

## Choosing and scoping your topic
Choosing a suitable topic is the first and most important decision. A good geographical study or issue should be complex rather than merely descriptive; it should invite analysis, comparison or evaluation and allow you to use a range of methods. Think about phrasing your study as a question or a testable hypothesis, for example: “How does pebble size and angularity change downstream on the River X?” or “To what extent has pedestrianisation improved environmental quality in Town Y?” For a geographical issue, choose a current and debatable topic where different credible sources present contrasting viewpoints, for example the sustainability of a major housing development, the effectiveness of coastal management at a particular stretch of coastline, or the social impacts of urban regeneration. When you select a topic, consider access to the necessary data and whether fieldwork is feasible in the available timeframe. Early background reading helps you refine scope: a narrowly focused study may be valid, but it must still allow for sufficient collection, processing and analysis to meet the assessment demands.

## Planning fieldwork, sampling and logistics
A clear, realistic plan protects your time and ensures reliable results. Your plan should state location, timescale, methods, sampling strategy and health-and-safety considerations. Sampling must be chosen to produce valid, repeatable data: random sampling helps avoid bias where possible, stratified sampling allows for comparisons between different zones, and regular sampling along transects suits many physical studies. For example, in a river pebble study you could sample at regular 100 m intervals across the channel at several cross-sections and record pebble axis lengths and angularity. If working in groups to collect field data, make sure you record precisely which data you contributed to; group collection is acceptable, but the write-up must be your own. Always use a field notebook or digital equivalent to record raw observations, times, equipment used and any deviations from the plan. Discuss contingency plans for weather, access and instrument failure, and ensure you have parental or institutional consent and a risk assessment for any off-site work.

## Gathering data: methods for physical and human geography
Choose techniques appropriate to your question. Physical techniques can include beach profiles measured with ranging poles and clinometers, stream cross-sections and flow estimates using float timing or flow meters, pebble size measurement with vernier calipers and pebble charts, soil sampling with pH testing and moisture determination, and vegetation sampling by quadrat counts. Human techniques include environmental quality surveys, structured questionnaires, pedestrian or traffic counts, interviews and perception mapping. When designing questionnaires or interviews, pilot them first to remove ambiguous wording and to ensure they collect the information you need. For perception studies, mental mapping or Likert-type scales can reveal spatial or attitudinal patterns. Record the sampling method and justify it in your write-up so an examiner understands why your approach was appropriate and how you minimised errors and bias.

## Data processing, statistics and mapping techniques
Processing the data you collect is where geography becomes analytical. Start by organising raw data into labelled tables and checking for errors or outliers. Use descriptive statistics to summarise central tendency and spread: mean, median and mode indicate centre; range, interquartile range and standard deviation describe dispersion. Choose the measure that best fits your data distribution. For relationships, scattergraphs with lines of best fit allow visual assessment; Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient is appropriate for normally distributed interval data, while Spearman’s rank is useful for ordinal or non-normal data. Chi-squared tests can assess whether observed categorical patterns deviate significantly from expectations. Remember to state null and alternative hypotheses and report the test statistic and significance level in a concise way.

Mapping and graphical techniques are equally important. Annotated overlays and transect diagrams are ideal for showing changes along a line of study; choropleth maps communicate density or rate information across regions; proportional symbol and flow line maps show magnitudes and movements; isoline maps reveal gradients. Choose the mapping technique that most clearly answers your research question. All graphs and maps must be fully labelled with titles, axis labels and units, and you should include a brief caption explaining what the figure shows and why it is relevant. Where relevant, combine mapping with statistical evidence — for example, use a scattergraph to demonstrate a correlation and a transect map to show spatial context.

## Presentation, structure and word limits
Your folio must read like a coherent research report. Structure the geographical study around an introduction with a clear aim and justification, a methods section describing sampling and processing, a results section presenting processed data and figures, an analysis that links the results to geographical theory or models, an evaluation of methods and data quality, and reasoned conclusions. The geographical study has a maximum of 3,000 words and the geographical issue a maximum of 1,800 words; these counts exclude front matter, figure annotations, references, bibliography and appendices. Exceeding the limit by more than 10% attracts penalties, so edit carefully for precision and relevance. Presentation standards matter: use A4 pages, a clear 12 point font for main text, consistent headings and subheadings, 1.5 line spacing, and sensible margins. Figures should be legible and placed close to the text that refers to them. Appendices are appropriate for raw data, detailed calculations or lengthy questionnaires, but do not hide essential evidence there — the examiner should be able to follow your argument without having to hunt through appendices for key material.

## Referencing, academic honesty and authenticity
Accurate referencing is both an academic requirement and a practical safeguard against plagiarism. Use a consistent referencing system such as Harvard, APA or MLA and include in-text references whenever you paraphrase or quote, and a full bibliography listing all sources at the end. For printed sources include author, date, title, page and publisher details; for web sources note the URL and date accessed. Short quotations can be used sparingly, but prefer concise paraphrase followed by a reference. If a paragraph draws mainly on a single source, reference it clearly at the end of the paragraph. Keep a careful record of all sources as you research so you can construct a reliable bibliography and avoid accidental omission. Teachers will monitor authenticity through progress checkpoints, interviews and signature logs; group data collection should be acknowledged, and the final write-up must be entirely your own work. Reasonable assistance from teachers is allowed, but substantive one-to-one guidance that changes your analysis or conclusions risks compromising authenticity.

## Managing time, supervision and practicalities
Treat the project as a timed programme of work with staged deadlines. Agree interim checkpoints with your teacher so you receive formative feedback and so supervisors can confirm authenticity. Start background reading early, schedule fieldwork when conditions are most likely to suit your methods, and allow time for data cleaning, statistical analysis and multiple drafts of written sections. Keep clear records of your fieldwork days, the equipment used and any adjustments to method; this material will strengthen your evaluation section. Be mindful of ethical issues when surveying people: explain the purpose of the research, obtain consent, and ensure anonymity when required. If technical skills such as GIS or advanced statistics are needed, seek training early; these skills add rigour but require practice. Finally, back up electronic files frequently and keep a printed copy of the final submission where permitted.

## Exam technique
The external question paper complements the project–folio by sampling map interpretation, gathering and processing techniques, and data handling. Expect two or three questions in 2 hours 30 minutes, using a 1:25 000 OS map extract plus supplementary items such as photographs, graphs and tracing overlays. In the map interpretation part, answer by citing precise map evidence: give grid references, use scale for distance calculations, and interpret relief and landform symbols in relation to processes. For gathering and processing technique questions, be ready to describe and evaluate methods: explain sampling design, potential sources of error, and how you would improve reliability. In data-handling questions, show your working for statistical calculations, choose appropriate graphs and tests, and interpret results in geographical terms rather than as abstract numbers. Time management is crucial: skim the paper and allocate time proportional to marks, start with questions where you can score confidently, and leave time to check calculations and labelling on graphs and maps. Practise past papers under timed conditions and learn the command words such as “explain”, “evaluate”, “describe” and “justify”, because each requires a different balance of description, linkage to theory, evidence and judgement. Use your atlas where allowed to give context, and where a question asks for evaluation, include method limitations and recommendations as part of a reasoned final judgement.
