# Development and health: indicators and disease control (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview
Development and health are tightly linked themes in human geography. How prosperous or prosperous-seeming a country is will influence the health of its population, and patterns of disease in turn affect economic performance, educational attainment and demographic change. This topic examines how development is measured, the strengths and weaknesses of those measures, why countries at similar stages of development can have very different outcomes, and how water-related diseases are caused, controlled and prevented. It also explores practical primary healthcare strategies used in developing-country contexts and how to evaluate their success. Throughout, the emphasis is on using indicators critically and applying case-study evidence to support explanations and judgements.

## Measuring development: indicators and indices
Development is measured using a mix of economic, social, demographic and environmental indicators. Economic indicators such as Gross National Income (GNI) or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita give a quick measure of the average monetary value of goods and services produced and are easy to compare between countries. Social indicators, including literacy rates, mean years of schooling and life expectancy, reveal aspects of human capital and long-term wellbeing that money alone cannot capture. Demographic indicators such as crude birth and death rates, infant mortality and maternal mortality rates highlight health and reproductive outcomes. Environmental indicators — for example, the proportion of the population with access to safe drinking water and sanitation — are particularly relevant where disease is water-related. Composite indices combine several dimensions into a single number: the Human Development Index (HDI) blends life expectancy, education and per capita income to provide a broader view of wellbeing, while indices such as the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) account for overlapping deprivations.

Using a range of indicators is important because each one reveals a different facet of development. A country may score reasonably well on income while lagging in education or health, and composite indices attempt to reflect that complexity. For exam answers, being clear about the type of indicator being used and what it does or does not show is crucial.

## Validity and limitations of development indicators
No single indicator offers a complete picture of development. Economic indicators calculated at national level can be distorted by exchange rate fluctuations, the presence of multinational corporations, natural resource revenues and informal economic activity. GNI per capita is an average and so masks internal inequalities: a high national income can coexist with a large proportion of the population living in poverty. Similarly, life expectancy or literacy rates are useful but can conceal regional disparities, gender inequalities and differences between urban and rural populations.

Composite indices address some of these problems but introduce others. The HDI simplifies complex realities into a single score, which is useful for comparison but can obscure the specific areas where a country is succeeding or failing. Data quality is a fundamental limitation; many developing countries lack reliable, up-to-date census or health surveillance systems, which leads to underreporting of births, deaths and disease incidence. Political factors may influence official statistics, and migration or seasonal labour can complicate population-based measures. Finally, indicators are often retrospective: they describe past conditions rather than current dynamics, which matters when rapid economic or environmental change is underway.

A thoughtful evaluation of indicators requires noting these limitations and giving concrete examples: a country with high per capita income from oil may still have poor access to safe water for much of its population; a nation recovering from conflict may register improving GDP before its public health infrastructure has been rebuilt.

## Why developing countries differ: geographic, historical and policy factors
Differences in development between so-called developing countries arise from a complex interplay of historical legacies, physical geography, governance, economic strategy and external relationships. Colonial histories shaped patterns of land ownership, infrastructure and trade that persist; countries that were integrated into extractive export systems often developed weak domestic markets and limited industrial capacity. Physical geography matters too: landlocked countries face higher transport costs and more constrained access to export markets; regions with poor soils, recurrent drought or disease burdens have added development challenges. Natural resource endowments can be a blessing or a curse; while minerals or oil can provide state revenue, dependence on a single commodity can create volatility, poor governance incentives and limited diversification.

Governance, institutions and conflict are decisive. Countries with stable governments, effective public administrations and transparent institutions are more likely to invest in education, health services and infrastructure, attracting private investment and improving outcomes. Conversely, corruption, weak rule of law and prolonged conflict divert resources and disrupt service provision. Economic policy choices — whether to promote inward investment, protect nascent industries or focus on export-led growth — influence how quickly economies diversify and provide jobs. External factors such as debt burdens, terms of trade, foreign aid and global market access also play a role.

Illustrative contrasts make these points clear. Some countries in sub-Saharan Africa have sustained high growth and improved social indicators due to prudent macroeconomic management and investment in health and education, while others remain trapped in cycles of conflict and poverty despite similar natural-resource potential. South and East Asian economies, through investments in education and export manufacturing, show how policy choices and integration into global markets can accelerate development. The key lesson is that development is not uniform across the “developing world”; geography, history and policy combine to produce diverse trajectories.

## Water-related disease: causes, impacts and a case study
Water-related diseases remain a major development challenge because they directly undermine health, productivity and schooling. These illnesses originate from contaminated drinking water, inadequate sanitation, poor hygiene practices, and environmental conditions that favour vectors. Cholera is a classic example: it is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, transmitted through fecally contaminated water and food, and often flares after flooding, population displacement or failure of sanitation systems. The immediate health impact can be dramatic — rapid onset of diarrhoea and severe dehydration that, if untreated, leads to death — and the wider economic and social consequences are severe. Outbreaks reduce labour productivity, strain healthcare facilities, depress tourism and trade, and increase direct healthcare costs for households and governments.

Bangladesh provides a useful case study of a country where cholera has been endemic but where a combination of public-health measures, community adaptation and economic development has reduced mortality over time. Seasonal flooding and overcrowded urban settlements create high transmission risk, but the widespread adoption of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), improvements in water supply for many urban areas, and targeted vaccination campaigns during outbreaks have substantially cut fatality rates. Yet the disease persists in some places where sanitation is poor and safe water access remains limited, demonstrating that long-term control requires infrastructure as well as clinical interventions.

When analysing any water-related disease, it is important to separate immediate causes (contaminated water sources, poor sanitation) from underlying drivers (poverty, lack of infrastructure, population density, governance failures) and to consider both short-term emergency responses and longer-term prevention.

## Primary healthcare strategies: principles and examples
Primary healthcare (PHC) is the frontline approach to improving population health in resource-limited settings. Its core principles emphasise accessibility, community participation, prevention and the use of appropriate, affordable technology. PHC strategies are wide-ranging and can include routine immunisation programmes, maternal and child health services, growth monitoring, health education, community water and sanitation initiatives, distribution of bed nets and integrated management of common childhood illnesses.

Practical implementations vary. Community health worker programmes bring basic services and health education to remote populations and often serve as the primary contact between the health system and households. Immunisation campaigns can produce rapid reductions in vaccine-preventable diseases; community-led total sanitation initiatives aim to reduce open defecation by combining behaviour change with incremental infrastructure. Integrated approaches that combine improved water supply, sanitation, hygiene education and community mobilisation tend to be the most effective for preventing water-related disease. Primary healthcare also encompasses referral systems that link local clinics to higher-level facilities for complicated cases, and surveillance systems that detect outbreaks early.

Real-world examples strengthen exam answers. Ethiopia’s deployment of large numbers of health extension workers has increased immunisation coverage and maternal health outreach in rural areas. Brazil’s family health strategy used multidisciplinary teams to reach poor urban and rural populations, reducing infant mortality. These programmes show how investments in PHC can translate into measurable health gains, but they also expose limitations linked to funding, training, supply chains and retention of staff.

## Evaluating disease control: effectiveness, challenges and sustainability
Assessing disease-control strategies requires consideration of cost-effectiveness, equity, scalability and sustainability. Short-term measures such as emergency water chlorination, mass vaccination or distribution of oral rehydration salts are essential to save lives during outbreaks and are often highly cost-effective. However, without lasting investment in sanitation infrastructure, safe piped water, and reliable waste management, diseases will recur. Behavioural change campaigns can be powerful, but their success depends on cultural appropriateness, consistent messaging and community ownership.

Challenges are numerous. Infrastructure projects demand heavy upfront capital, long-term maintenance and technical capacity that many low-income contexts struggle to provide. Political instability and conflict undermine both routine services and emergency responses. Climate change complicates control efforts by altering rainfall patterns, increasing flooding and expanding vector habitats. Antimicrobial resistance and evolving pathogens also require adaptive public-health strategies.

Sustainability depends on integrating disease control with broader development goals. Building local capacity, ensuring adequate financing (from domestic budgets and sustainable external aid), and linking health interventions with education, water and sanitation, and economic development increase resilience. Monitoring and reliable data systems are essential for measuring impact and adjusting programmes.

## Exam technique
When answering examination questions on development and health, begin by defining key terms and specifying the indicator(s) or disease you will discuss. For questions on indicators, state which measures you are using (for example, GNI per capita, life expectancy, infant mortality, HDI) and explain what they show. Immediately follow with a critical assessment: outline strengths but emphasise limitations with concrete examples, such as how averages mask inequality or how data collection problems undermine validity. For "compare" or "explain" questions about differences between countries, structure your response thematically — historical legacies, physical geography, governance, economic policy — and use case-study evidence to support each point. For water-related disease questions, describe the pathogen or mode of transmission, explain proximal causes (contaminated water, poor sanitation) and underlying drivers (poverty, infrastructure deficits), and then outline both emergency and long-term management measures. When asked to evaluate primary healthcare strategies, balance description with judgement: explain how community health workers, vaccination and sanitation initiatives work in practice, then assess cost, equity and sustainability.

Always link answers back to the question throughout and avoid long unreferenced lists. Use specific case-study details to illustrate general points and draw reasoned conclusions that address the command word (for example, "assess", "discuss", "explain"). If appropriate, briefly suggest alternative strategies or improvements to demonstrate depth of understanding. Finally, practise past-paper questions under timed conditions, plan answers with a brief paragraph structure before writing, and ensure your conclusion succinctly answers the question asked.
