# Global climate change: causes, impacts and responses (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What is meant by global climate change and why it matters
Global climate change refers to the long-term alteration of average weather patterns and the Earth’s energy balance. It is not simply year-to-year weather variability but sustained shifts in temperature, precipitation, storminess and sea level driven by changes in the atmosphere, oceans, ice masses and biosphere. At Higher/Advanced level it helps to think in terms of the global heat budget — the balance between incoming shortwave solar radiation and outgoing longwave terrestrial radiation — and the processes that redistribute that energy, including atmospheric circulation cells, ocean currents and the position and behaviour of features such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The contemporary concern is that human activities have enhanced the natural greenhouse effect, causing global mean temperatures to rise by roughly around 1.1°C since pre‑industrial times and pushing many Earth system components outside the range within which human societies have developed. That warming has consequences for water resources, food production, coastal communities, ecosystems and human health, so it is a central issue in geography and sustainable development.

## Physical drivers and the climate system
The climate system is driven by external and internal physical processes. External factors include variations in incoming solar radiation and changes in Earth’s orbit over geological timescales, which have produced the glacial–interglacial cycles of the Quaternary. Internal processes redistribute energy: atmospheric circulation cells move heat from equatorial to polar regions; ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream transport vast amounts of heat; and the cryosphere and biosphere store and release energy and water. Feedback mechanisms are important: melting snow and ice reduce albedo so more solar energy is absorbed, while warming permafrost releases methane and carbon dioxide, amplifying warming. Natural variability also operates at shorter timescales — volcanic eruptions can inject aerosols that cool climate temporarily, and modes of variability such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation alter global weather patterns. Understanding these physical drivers gives important context when explaining observed changes and impacts, for example why a shifted ITCZ alters rainfall regimes in West Africa or how ocean heat uptake moderates surface warming but raises sea levels through thermal expansion.

## Human causes and the enhanced greenhouse effect
Human causes focus on emissions and land-use change that alter the composition of the atmosphere and the way land and oceans store carbon. The burning of fossil fuels for energy, industry and transport releases carbon dioxide at a rate that far exceeds natural carbon sinks; atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased from about 280 parts per million (ppm) before the Industrial Revolution to over 410 ppm in the 21st century. Deforestation and changes in land use reduce the capacity of soils and vegetation to absorb carbon, while agricultural practices release methane and nitrous oxide, potent greenhouse gases. Urbanisation alters surface characteristics and local microclimates, and some industrial processes emit long‑lived gases. These human drivers combine with physical feedbacks to produce the observed warming and associated changes in climate variability. The scale and speed of recent greenhouse gas increases make the contemporary trend distinct from many natural changes in the Earth’s history.

## Impacts: physical environment and human systems
The impacts of climate change are wide-ranging and cascade across physical systems and societies. Physically, rising global temperatures are associated with glacier retreat, reductions in Arctic sea ice, permafrost thaw and thermal expansion of the oceans, all contributing to sea-level rise. Changes in the hydrological cycle are evident in altered precipitation patterns: some regions experience more intense rainfall and flooding while others face longer and more severe droughts. Ocean warming and acidification affect marine ecosystems, causing coral bleaching and shifts in fisheries. At the human scale, these physical changes affect food security through modified crop yields and pest distributions, increase the risk to settlements on low-lying coasts and river floodplains, and intensify the health burdens of heatwaves, vector-borne diseases and water‑related illnesses. Socio-economic impacts include damage to infrastructure, disruption of water supplies, forced migration from high-risk areas (as seen in some low-lying atoll nations and delta regions), and unequal effects that hit the poorest and least resilient communities hardest. Examples are instructive: small island states such as Kiribati and parts of Bangladesh face persistent threat from sea-level rise and storm surges; the Sahel and parts of southern Africa have experienced shifts in the timing and reliability of rains that challenge rainfed agriculture; and Europe has seen deadly heatwaves that expose weaknesses in urban planning and health provision.

## Responses: mitigation, adaptation and governance
Responses to climate change are commonly grouped as mitigation (actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove gases from the atmosphere) and adaptation (actions to reduce vulnerability to impacts). Mitigation includes decarbonising energy systems by expanding renewable electricity (onshore and offshore wind, solar PV), improving energy efficiency, changing transport systems, and switching from fossil fuels to low-carbon alternatives. Land-use responses — afforestation, sustainable forestry, and agricultural practices that sequester carbon — are part of mitigation, as are technological options such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Adaptation covers a spectrum from hard engineering coastal defences and managed retreat to nature-based solutions such as restoring mangroves and wetlands that attenuate storm surge, to changing agricultural practices and developing drought‑resistant crops, to strengthening public health systems and early warning for extreme events. Effective response mixes both approaches: mitigation reduces future risk while adaptation lowers present and near-term vulnerability.

International governance under the UNFCCC framework, through agreements such as the Paris Agreement, focuses on nationally determined contributions (NDCs), finance for mitigation and adaptation, and mechanisms that encourage technology transfer. At national and local levels, planning for climate resilience requires integration with river basin management, urban transport and housing policy, and energy planning. Practical examples include coastal zone management in Bangladesh that combines cyclone shelters and embankment improvements with community-based early-warning systems; renewable energy deployment in Scotland focusing on wind and marine resources; and city-level measures to reduce heat risk through green infrastructure. All responses come with trade-offs and limits: high upfront costs, differing development priorities, political resistance, technological maturity and questions of justice that question who pays and who benefits.

## Limits, trade-offs and equity considerations
No response is cost-free or without limitations. Many mitigation technologies require large capital investment and long lead times; carbon removal methods are at varying stages of feasibility and raise ethical questions if used to justify continued high emissions; and adaptation can create maladaptation if poorly designed, for example where hard defences increase risk elsewhere or where irrigation adaptation increases water scarcity downstream. Internationally, equity is central: historically high-emitting countries have benefited from development tied to fossil fuels, while low-emitting nations, often with limited adaptive capacity, face disproportionate impacts. This creates political tension about finance and responsibility. Climate policy must therefore wrestle with competing objectives — sustaining development and reducing poverty, meeting energy needs, protecting ecosystems, and limiting warming — and address distributive justice through mechanisms such as climate finance, loss and damage funds, and capacity-building for adaptation in vulnerable nations. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for evaluating real-world responses in exam answers.

## Linking ideas across the course
Global climate change is not an isolated topic. It connects directly to atmosphere topics (global heat budget, atmospheric circulation and the ITCZ), hydrosphere dynamics (changes in runoff, hydrograph responses to intense rainfall), lithosphere and coastal processes (sea-level rise, erosion, and sediment dynamics), biosphere processes (soil carbon, vegetation feedbacks) and human geography (migration, urban management, energy systems). When preparing answers, always look for opportunities to integrate these links: explain how atmospheric circulation changes alter rainfall in a river basin study, or how energy policy decisions at national level influence global emission trajectories. Case studies drawn from all three course sections strengthen answers by demonstrating applied understanding, such as using a river basin example to illustrate how changing rainfall influences both water management and agricultural adaptation.

## Exam technique
Answering global climate change questions successfully requires clarity, structure and evidence. Begin by identifying the command word: explain requires cause-and-effect chains; discuss requires balanced consideration of arguments; evaluate asks for judgement supported by criteria and evidence. For a 20-mark question, start with a brief definition and outline to show you understand the question’s focus. Develop the body of your answer in clear paragraphs that each make a point, explain the mechanism or effect, and illustrate with an example or data. When asked to evaluate or discuss management strategies, present both strengths and limitations and bring in considerations of feasibility, cost and equity; conclude with a judgement that weighs the evidence. Use relevant course theory — for example the global heat budget, feedback mechanisms or concepts of mitigation versus adaptation — and link to specific case studies that you have prepared. Diagrams can be worthwhile: an annotated carbon cycle, a simple hydrograph illustrating changing runoff under extreme rainfall, or a sketch showing coastal management options can earn marks if they are clear and labelled. Time management is important: in paper 2 you will be selecting two global issues questions, so allocate time to plan and write two well-structured essays, leaving a short period for review. Finally, ensure you use precise geographical vocabulary, reference named examples, and where appropriate balance physical and human explanations to demonstrate the breadth and depth expected at Higher level.
