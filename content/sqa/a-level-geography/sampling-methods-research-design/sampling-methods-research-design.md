# Sampling methods and research design (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: why sampling and design matter in geographical research
Good research design is the backbone of any successful Advanced Higher geographical study or issue. Whether you are measuring pebble sizes down a river, assessing environmental quality along an urban transect, or investigating people's perceptions of place, you rarely have the time or resources to measure every element in the population. Sampling provides a practical, systematic way to collect data that can be generalised with known levels of confidence. Thoughtful sampling and clear research design both improve the validity and reliability of your findings and make your project–folio or exam answers more convincing. When designing a study you should always be able to justify how and why you chose particular sampling approaches, how your sampling links to the question or hypothesis, and how you minimised bias and error.

## Core sampling concepts: population, sample, sampling unit and sampling frame
Before choosing a method it is essential to be clear about what you are sampling. The population is the entire group you want to draw conclusions about, the sampling unit is the smallest element that can be selected (a pebble, a household, a 1 m2 quadrat, a pedestrian), and the sample is the subset you actually measure. The sampling frame is the practical list or map from which you draw your sample, such as a grid of transect points, an annotated map of study sites, or a timetable of pedestrian survey times. Clear definition of these elements lets you explain why the sample can legitimately represent the population and helps you decide appropriate analytical techniques. Always make the sampling unit explicit in your write-up and ensure that the sampling frame covers the population without systematic omissions.

## Main sampling methods and when to use them
Random sampling, regular (systematic) sampling and stratified sampling are all explicitly listed in the Advanced Higher specification and are commonly used in fieldwork. Random sampling means every unit in the population has an equal chance of selection and is the best defence against selection bias when a complete sampling frame is available; for example, random points along a mapped river reach chosen by numbered grid references to select pebble samples. Regular or systematic sampling uses fixed intervals, such as every fifth paver on an urban transect or every 10 m across a beach profile; it is simple to implement and ensures even spatial coverage but must be chosen carefully where underlying periodicity might bias results. Stratified sampling divides the population into meaningful subgroups and samples proportionally or equally from each stratum; this is useful when parts of the area differ markedly in character, for example sampling commercial, residential and industrial zones separately in an urban study to ensure each land-use category is represented.

Other pragmatic methods are sometimes used in classroom contexts but require careful justification. Cluster sampling, where you sample whole groups or clusters (such as chosen city blocks), reduces travel and logistical costs and can be appropriate for pedestrian counts or household surveys. Convenience sampling, where you sample whoever is available, is quick but introduces high risk of bias and should only be used with explicit acknowledgement of its limitations. Whatever method you adopt, you must explain how it links to your hypothesis and how it affects the strength of your conclusions.

## Designing sampling strategies for different geographical contexts
Sampling strategies must suit the physical or human context and the question posed. In a river boulder study you might combine systematic transect sampling with stratified selections of bedload types so that samples are taken at set intervals downstream while ensuring different channel zones are represented; caliper measurements at each transect point produce interval data appropriate for correlation tests. For a vegetation survey a randomly thrown quadrat across a mapped study area or a stratified random approach where quadrats are allocated proportional to habitat types will give robust estimates of species abundance and diversity. Urban studies often benefit from transects that cross identifiable zones; using a regular sampling interval with environmental quality scores at every 50 m can pick up gradients of change while interviews or perception surveys at stratified locations capture human viewpoints. The key is to match sampling intensity to spatial variability: areas with rapid change need denser sampling, whereas more homogeneous zones require fewer samples to achieve the same level of confidence.

## Avoiding bias and improving validity and reliability
Bias can creep into fieldwork at many points: in selecting sites, in the timing of surveys, in how questions are framed, or in measurement techniques. To reduce sampling bias, use randomisation where possible and document any unavoidable constraints, for example safety-related exclusions or land access restrictions. Reliability is enhanced by clear, repeatable protocols: record precise procedures for measurement, use calibrated instruments where possible, and train any team members so that techniques are consistent. Replication is important; repeat measurements, increase sample size where feasible, and take pilot data to refine methods before full-scale collection. Validity depends on whether the measures actually capture what you intend to study, so choose indicators that have a clear theoretical link to your research question and explain that link in your write-up. In your project–folio you will be expected to evaluate these aspects, noting limitations, potential confounding factors, and how they might be addressed in future work.

## Linking sampling to data types, presentation and statistical testing
Sampling design determines the types of data you can collect and the statistics you can reliably apply. Nominal data, such as rock type or land-use category, are analysed using frequency-based techniques and chi-squared tests for association. Ordinal data, like ranked perception scores or habitat quality indices, suit non-parametric correlation methods such as Spearman’s rank. Interval and ratio data, for instance pebble dimensions or river velocity, allow parametric tests such as Pearson’s product-moment correlation or linear regression if assumptions about distribution are met. Always state your null hypothesis for inferential tests and justify the choice of test with reference to data type and sampling method. For presentation, choose graphs that reveal spatial and statistical patterns clearly: scatter graphs to show relationships, transect cross-sections or annotated overlays to visualise spatial change, and choropleth or dot maps when mapping density or counts. Consider descriptive statistics such as mean, median, range and standard deviation to summarise central tendency and dispersion, and use coefficient of variation where series have different units or means.

## Practicalities, ethics and project–folio requirements
Practical constraints — time, equipment, safety and access — shape realistic sampling design. The Advanced Higher project–folio is conducted under some supervision and control and requires candidates to work independently while teachers provide reasonable assistance and monitor authenticity. Group data collection is acceptable provided individual contribution is clear and group-collected data is acknowledged. Health and safety are paramount in fieldwork, so select sampling locations and times with safety in mind and include risk assessments in your planning notes. Ethical considerations are important for human surveys and interviews; obtain informed consent, anonymise responses where appropriate, and be sensitive when dealing with vulnerable groups. Administratively, remember the project–folio word limits: up to 3,000 words for the geographical study and 1,800 words for the geographical issue, excluding front matter and appendices, and submit an accurate word count. Evidence of planning, such as a justified choice of topic, sampling strategy, pilot work and a bibliography, strengthens your submission and demonstrates reflective, independent research.

## Integrating sampling into research design and critical evaluation
A coherent research design links question, theory, sampling, data collection, processing and interpretation in a logical narrative. Start by framing a research question or hypothesis that is specific and testable, then select sampling methods that provide data directly relevant to that question. Plan processing techniques and analytical methods in advance so that your sampling yields the right kind of data. Pilot studies are especially useful in refining sample size and method and should be described briefly in your methodology. In the evaluation section of your study, go beyond listing limitations: assess how sampling choices affected the quality of evidence, discuss the likely direction and magnitude of any biases, and propose concrete improvements. Good candidates link findings back to wider literature and models, showing how their sample-based evidence supports or challenges existing explanations. This synthesis of method, result and theory is what distinguishes strong Advanced Higher work.

## Exam technique
When answering question paper items on sampling and research design, be explicit and economical. Start by defining your sampling unit and population, then state the sampling method and justify it in two or three sentences: explain how it increases representativeness and how it suits the spatial or human context. If asked about data handling, say what type(s) the data are (nominal, ordinal, interval) and name the descriptive and inferential statistics you would use, briefly noting any assumptions (for example distributional assumptions for parametric tests). When discussing gathering techniques, include practical details: sampling interval, number of samples, instruments and a short note on safety and replication. Always include an evaluation that considers reliability, validity and bias and suggest realistic improvements, such as using stratified sampling instead of convenience sampling, increasing sample size in areas of high variability, or conducting a pilot to refine methodology. In map interpretation and fieldwork questions, use evidence from the map or supplementary items to argue location choices and sampling positions, and when presenting calculations show working clearly and round appropriately. Finally, manage your time: allocate time to planning short, focused paragraphs that follow the command word (describe, explain, evaluate) and ensure every sentence advances your argument or provides necessary justification.
