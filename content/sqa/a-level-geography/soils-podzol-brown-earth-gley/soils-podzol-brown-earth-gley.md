# Soils: podzol, brown earth and gley (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What soils are and why these three matter
Soil is a living, layered medium formed by the interaction of climate, organisms, relief, parent material and time. For geographers at Higher level, understanding soil means recognising how different processes create distinct profiles, how soils control land use and vegetation, and how they respond to human activity. Podzol, brown earth and gley soils are three contrasting soil types commonly studied in the UK and Scotland. They illustrate a spectrum from strongly leached, acidic upland soils through fertile, mixed woodland and arable soils to waterlogged soils with characteristic redox features. Each type has clear diagnostic horizons and processes; each also has implications for agriculture, forestry, drainage and conservation.

## Podzols: features and formation by podzolisation
Podzols typically form under cool, wet climates with acidic vegetation such as coniferous forest and heath, and on coarse-textured parent materials like sands and some acid metamorphic or igneous rocks. The profile is distinctive: a thin organic O horizon overlies a dark humic A horizon that is often leached to form a pale, ash-coloured E horizon and a darker B horizon enriched in organic matter, iron and aluminium compounds. The process of podzolisation is driven by acidic leachates produced from decomposing needles and heather. Organic acids chelate iron and aluminium, forming soluble complexes which are translocated down the profile and then precipitate in the B horizon as humus-Fe/Al accumulations. Low temperatures and poor biological activity slow decomposition, while coarse texture allows percolation and strong eluviation. In Scotland, classic podzols occur on upland granite and sandstone in the Highlands and on slopes with blanket bog and heath. Under afforestation with non-native conifers, podzol profiles can deepen and acidity can increase; conversely, drainage and liming for agriculture reduce podzol characteristics and may convert the soil towards a more brown earth character. When describing a podzol in the field, look for the striking bleached E horizon, a dark spodic B horizon often with iron pans or hardpans, and stunted, acid-loving vegetation.

## Brown earths: mixed soils of the lowlands and their productivity
Brown earths are among the most agriculturally valuable soils in the UK and are commonly found across lowland Scotland and the British Isles where climate is milder and drainage is better. They form under deciduous woodland or long-established grassland and on a wide range of parent materials, including glacial tills, loess and base-rich sediments. The profile is relatively simple and well mixed by soil organisms: a dark, humus-rich A horizon gradually grades into a brown B horizon containing weathered minerals and modest clay illuviation, and then into the C horizon. Processes of bioturbation—earthworms and other soil fauna—mix organic matter through the upper soil and promote rapid decomposition; eluviation and illuviation occur but are less extreme than in podzols. Brown earths are typically neutral to slightly acidic, have good structure and drainage, and support productive arable and pastoral farming. In the field they are recognised by a uniform brown colour, crumb structure in the A horizon, and the ease with which roots penetrate the profile. Land use often includes cereals, root crops and improved grassland, and management tends towards ploughing, liming and routine nutrient inputs to maintain fertility.

## Gley soils: formation under waterlogging and redox conditions
Gley soils develop in areas where waterlogging is frequent or prolonged, creating anaerobic conditions that change the chemistry and colour of the soil. Water saturation may be seasonal, caused by poor surface drainage, high water tables, or flooding on floodplains and valley bottoms. Under anaerobic conditions iron is reduced from ferric (insoluble) to ferrous (soluble) forms and is thereby mobilised. The typical gley profile shows grey-blue or greenish hues in the main body of the soil where reduced iron dominates, with reddish-brown mottles where occasional oxygen reaches the soil and oxidises iron locally. Surface gleying often produces a dark organic-rich surface over gleyed subsoil; groundwater gleying tends to show a mottled transition to more oxidised materials. Gleys are common in river floodplains, valley bottoms in upland Scotland, and in poorly drained agricultural fields. They are often fertile where organic matter accumulates, but poor aeration restricts root growth and delays spring cultivation. Management frequently involves artificial drainage to lower the water table, careful timing of cultivation, and selection of water-tolerant crops or grassland. When identifying a gley, focus on colour patterns, presence of mottles, smell of reduced sulfur (in severe waterlogging) and signs of seasonal waterlogging such as oxidation along root channels.

## The controls on soil formation: applying CLORPT to these soils
Explaining why podzol, brown earth and gley soils form where they do requires the CLORPT framework: climate, organisms, relief (topography), parent material and time. Climate controls intensity of leaching and decomposition: cooler, wetter climates favour podzolisation, while milder climates encourage brown earth development. Organisms, notably vegetation type and soil fauna, supply the acids or organic inputs that drive processes; conifer needles and heath produce the strongly acidic litter that promotes podzolisation, whereas broadleaf litter and active earthworm communities mix and enrich brown earths. Relief influences drainage and accumulation; podzols often occur on slopes or well-drained plateaus where percolation is strong, brown earths dominate on rolling, free-draining lowlands, and gleys occupy concave positions, hollows and floodplains where water collects. Parent material dictates mineral supply and texture: coarse quartz-rich sands encourage leaching and podzol development, fine-textured loams and tills favour brown earths by retaining moisture and nutrients, and impermeable clays promote gleying. Time allows these processes to produce recognisable horizons; podzolisation and gleying require sustained conditions over long periods to develop pronounced horizons. Field examples in Scotland include podzols on granite tors of the Cairngorms, brown earths on loess-derived soils in the Central Belt, and gleys on the floodplains of the Tay and low-lying peat and valley bottom areas.

## Field methods and practical identification for assignments
A practical understanding of these soils is essential for fieldwork and for producing a strong assignment. Begin with a clear, safely dug soil pit or use a soil auger to extract cores where digging is not feasible. Describe horizons using depth, colour (note pale E horizons in podzols and grey/blue colours and mottling in gleys), texture by feel (sand, silt, clay proportions), structure (crumb, blocky, platy), roots and bioturbation, drainage, and vegetation. Sketch a neat, annotated soil profile showing horizon boundaries, approximate depths, and the main features you observed—label the O, A, E, B and C horizons as appropriate and annotate the processes such as eluviation, illuviation, podzolisation or gleying. Simple field tests improve your evidence: a squeeze test gives a texture estimate, pH paper indicates acidity (podzols commonly acidic, brown earths near neutral), and a smell or observation of stagnant water can give clues to anaerobic conditions. For an assignment that compares soils along a slope, use a transect and locate sampling points at ridge, midslope and toeslope to demonstrate a soil catena; this often reveals podzolised soils higher up, brown earths on mid slopes or interfluves, and gleying at the toeslope or valley bottom. Always record GPS locations, aspect and recent land use, and photograph profiles with a scale for marking. Process your field data to link profile descriptions to the controlling factors and to any land-use implications you will evaluate.

## Land-use implications and human impacts
Soil type underpins what land can be used for and what management is required. Brown earths are broadly versatile and support arable farming and intensive grassland because of good drainage, structure and moderate pH. Podzols are acidic and nutrient-poor, so they are better suited to extensive sheep grazing, forestry (often with conifer planting) or conservation of heathland; converting podzols to productive arable land requires intensive interventions—deep drainage, liming and fertilisation—and can damage peat and biodiversity. Gley soils can be productive for grass if drained, but unfavourable for early seedbed work and root crops; drainage ditches and tile drains are common solutions but they alter hydrology and can affect downstream water quality and wetland habitats. Human activities can accelerate soil change: afforestation can increase acidity and organic accumulation, ploughing and liming can homogenise horizons and mask podzolisation, and drainage projects can oxidise and compact peat or cause subsidence. Sustainable land management requires matching soil capability to land use, using careful drainage design, conserving organic-rich soils and using liming and nutrient applications responsibly.

## Integrating soil knowledge with wider geography topics
Soil studies connect to many higher-level geography topics. In the hydrological cycle, water movement through soils affects runoff, infiltration and groundwater recharge; gleyed soils indicate impeded groundwater flow and potential flood risk. In the biosphere, soil type determines vegetation communities and carbon storage; podzols under heath and blanket bogs are significant in carbon budgets and peat formation. In the human environment, soils influence settlement, agriculture and infrastructure decisions; for example, gley soils may be problematic for foundations, while brown earths support dense settlement and productive farming. For global issues, soil degradation through erosion, acidification or drainage of peatlands has implications for sustainability and climate change mitigation. When preparing fieldwork or an assignment, explicitly link soil descriptions and processes to these broader physical and human contexts to demonstrate depth and application.

## Exam technique
When answering soil questions in the exam, start by reading the command word carefully and plan your structure. If asked to describe, focus on observable features—horizon sequence, colour, texture and drainage. If asked to explain or account for a soil’s characteristics, link features to processes: for a podzol explain podzolisation (acidic litter, chelation and downward movement of Fe/Al), for a brown earth describe bioturbation and balanced eluviation/illuviation, and for a gley describe waterlogging and redox-driven mottling. For evaluation and assessment questions, compare advantages and disadvantages for land use and management, and consider timescales and sustainability. Always include a labelled diagram when it helps; a simple, well-proportioned soil profile with horizon depths and process arrows will gain marks. Use specific examples or case studies—naming an upland Scottish granite landscape for podzols or a Central Belt lowland for brown earths strengthens answers. Manage time by allocating minutes to planning, writing and checking; in longer answers start with a brief definition, then develop points using cause–effect chains, link processes to evidence, and finish with a concise conclusion. For assignment-style questions or coursework prompts, ensure your research question is focused, field methods are appropriate (pit or auger, transect design), Processed Information is concise and not a draft of your write-up, and your conclusions are supported by both field data and secondary sources. Practise sketching clear soil profiles under timed conditions, practise using command words (describe, explain, evaluate, compare) and rehearse short case-study paragraphs that link soil type to vegetation and land use. Clear, precise language describing processes and careful use of field evidence consistently lift answers from good to excellent.
