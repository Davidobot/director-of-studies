# Ordnance Survey map interpretation (1:25,000) (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What a 1:25,000 OS Explorer map is for and how it is used in Advanced Higher Geography
The 1:25,000 Ordnance Survey Explorer series is a large-scale topographic map that shows a rich level of detail about terrain and human features. At this scale one centimetre on the map represents 250 metres on the ground, which makes Explorer maps especially useful for interpreting fine-grained spatial patterns, landforms and land use. In the Advanced Higher context you will be expected to use an OS extract as a primary source of evidence: to locate features precisely, to quantify distances and gradients, to infer processes and to support explanations or judgements. Practising with real Explorer sheets will help you become familiar with the conventions of colours, symbols and the way relief is portrayed, so that map evidence can be used confidently in the question paper and in fieldwork write-ups.

## The map basics: scale, grid references, orientation and symbols
A reliable answer starts with a sound grasp of the map’s basic conventions. Scale tells you how map measurements convert to real-world distances, so always show your working when converting map lengths into metres or kilometres. The National Grid divides the map into eastings and northings and grid references are the language of precise location. Four-figure grid references give a square; six-figure references locate a point within that square to the nearest 100 metres. When giving grid references in an exam, write the full six-figure reference if the question asks for a specific point, and label any sketch or overlay with the same reference. Orientation on OS maps is shown as grid north along the vertical grid lines; if a question asks for bearings you will normally use grid north unless otherwise specified. Symbols and colours are standardised: brown contours and spot heights represent relief, blue indicates water, black and grey show human constructions, green shading marks woodland, and a variety of pictorial symbols denote features such as quarries, churches, picnic sites or tourist facilities. Naming a symbol correctly and quoting its grid reference strengthens any map-based assertion.

## Reading relief and interpreting landforms
One of the most powerful skills in map interpretation is reading contours and turning lines into three-dimensional landscape ideas. Contour lines join points of equal elevation and their spacing reveals slope steepness: closely spaced contours mean steep ground; wide spacing indicates gentle slopes. Spot heights give exact elevations for prominent points. When asked to produce a cross-section, transfer the contour pattern onto a profile diagram so that crest and trough are clearly shown; add labelled vertical and horizontal scales to make the section quantitative. Contours also allow you to infer drainage direction (water flows from high to low and will often follow concave contour patterns), identify features such as river meanders, interlocking spurs, cols and summits, and to judge relative flood risk on floodplains. Relief shading (where present) amplifies the visual impression of slope and aspect; combining shading, contours and spot heights gives a stronger basis for explaining physical processes such as erosion, deposition or slope instability.

## Measuring and explaining gradients, distances and areas
Examiners expect precise measurements, clear calculations and correct units. To measure a distance along a road or path use a piece of string to follow curves, then compare its length against the map scale bar or rulers marked with the 1:25,000 scale. Convert map centimetres to metres and kilometres, always stating the scale in your working. For gradients, calculate the vertical change divided by horizontal distance and express the gradient either as a ratio (for example 1:100), a percentage or an angle if required. When estimating areas, use overlay tracing paper to copy the mapped boundary and count grid squares or use a planimeter technique; where exact calculation is impractical, justify any approximation and explain its likely error. In short, quantitative statements backed by visible working earn marks and make your reasoning more convincing.

## Human features, land use and settlement patterns
Explorer maps show many human features that you will be expected to interpret: roads and railways, settlement size and form, land parcels and field boundaries, recreational sites, and infrastructure such as reservoirs, quarries and power lines. The size, density and pattern of buildings on the map give clues to the type of settlement: clustered or nucleated villages, linear development along transport routes, or isolated farmsteads. By linking mapped human features with relief and accessibility you can explain why settlements developed where they did, why land use changes across the map, or why particular transport corridors exist. For example, a valley floor marked by a road, railway and settlements often reflects easier gradients and access to water, while hilltop cairns and sparsely populated plateaus suggest poor soils or exposure. When interpreting land use, use map evidence such as field patterns, woodland symbols and place names to suggest agricultural practices, recreation, conservation or extraction activities, and always relate these observations to underlying physical or economic constraints.

## Working with supplementary items: photographs, overlays, sketches and atlases
In Advanced Higher map interpretation you will often be asked to integrate map evidence with supplementary items such as ground photographs, sketch maps, tracing overlays, or small data tables. Treat each supplementary item as another piece of the puzzle: compare the photograph’s visible features with their mapped counterparts and explain any differences caused by scale, timing or perspective. For example, a photograph taken from a valley looking uphill will foreshorten slopes and may hide features visible on the map; a river channel visible on the map may be obscured in a winter photograph by high turbidity or by being incised. Overlays and sketches are useful for highlighting patterns or for creating annotated transects; a tracing overlay can show land-use zones or a sphere of influence without obscuring underlying contours. An atlas is a valuable classroom tool for placing the OS extract in a wider geographical context: use an atlas to check regional relief, settlement hierarchies and transport links that explain local patterns on the Explorer sheet.

## Fieldwork links: planning transects, sampling and transferring map skills to the ground
The skills used in map interpretation are the same ones that make fieldwork reliable and defensible. When planning transects or sampling strategies, use the map to choose representative sites, to avoid unsafe areas, and to ensure a mixture of aspects, slopes and land uses is covered. Map transects translate directly into field transects: record the grid references of sampling points, note the aspect and slope angle using a clinometer or smartphone app, and document human features with photographs tied to exact locations on the map. When you write up a geographical study, link field observations back to the map by referring to grid squares, contours and symbols. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of map-derived data: maps are excellent for spatial context and fixed infrastructure, but fieldwork reveals temporal changes, micro-topography and human behaviours that a static map cannot show. Explaining these complementarities in your fieldwork section demonstrates mature geographical thinking.

## Exam technique
Approach a map question by reading it twice and identifying exactly what is being asked. Underline command words such as “describe”, “explain”, “compare”, “calculate” or “evaluate” and plan a short response structure before you write: a clear beginning that states the feature or measurement you will deal with, a body that presents evidence (always quoting specific map features and grid references where relevant), and a short, justified conclusion. Use the map as your evidence. Phrase statements like “at grid reference 123456 there is…” or “contours at 12–14 indicate a gradient of…” so the examiner can see the direct link between your words and the map. When you make measurements, show the ruler or scale conversion, give units and label your calculations. When asked to interpret processes, link physical evidence (contours, drainage pattern, slope) to human evidence (settlement, land use, transport) and explain cause-and-effect rather than merely describing.

Manage your time by allocating it in proportion to the marks available. Reserve a minute or two at the start of a question to locate key features and return at the end to check you have answered every part. If a question provides a photograph or overlay, explicitly compare the two sources: say what the map shows that the photograph confirms, and what the photograph reveals that the map does not. Use sketches and labelled cross-sections where asked; these should be neat, correctly scaled where possible, and clearly annotated with heights, directions and feature names taken from the map. In evaluative or fieldwork-style questions, include a brief assessment of the reliability of the map evidence and suggest how further data (for example targeted field observations, up-to-date aerial imagery or local land-use records) would strengthen the interpretation.

Avoid common errors such as giving vague compass directions without reference points, failing to convert map measures to real-world units, or using the wrong type of grid reference. Do not over-interpret: stick to what the map and the supplementary materials reasonably support. Finally, practise under timed conditions, use a range of Explorer sheets, and get into the habit of writing answers that are both evidence-led and clearly structured. This combination of careful measurement, accurate location, process-based explanation and evaluative comment is what distinguishes top-scoring map interpretation answers.
