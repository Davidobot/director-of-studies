# Population structure, data and migration (A-level Geography Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Key concepts and overview
Population structure describes the composition of a population by age, sex and sometimes other characteristics such as ethnicity or employment status. It is a snapshot that helps geographers and policymakers understand current needs — for example, the balance between dependent people (children and the elderly) and the working-age population — and to anticipate future pressures on services like schools, healthcare and pensions. Migration is movement of people across space and can be temporary or permanent, internal (within a country) or international. Migration interacts with population structure: high levels of out-migration of working-age people can leave a place with an older profile, while in-migration of young adults can rejuvenate a city. Together, data on population structure and migration inform planning, development strategies and political debate.

## Population data: sources and challenges
The main sources of population data are censuses, sample surveys, civil registration systems (births and deaths), administrative records and, increasingly, estimates made using satellite imagery and modelling. A census aims to enumerate everyone at a point in time and is extremely valuable because it provides detailed local information. However, it is costly and infrequent, so it can rapidly become out of date. Sample surveys and administrative data can provide more frequent updates but cover smaller populations or are designed for other purposes, introducing potential mismatches. In many developing countries there are significant problems in data collection: lack of comprehensive civil registration, limited access to remote or conflict-affected areas, and the presence of undocumented populations in informal settlements. These issues can produce undercounts or biased samples. Political factors may also affect data quality: governments may under-report minority groups for political reasons or exaggerate figures to attract aid. When using any data in answers, it is essential to judge reliability, note the date of collection, and consider how problems of undercounting, sampling error and definitional differences (for example, how “migrant” or “household” is defined) influence interpretation.

## Reading population structure: pyramids and metrics
Population pyramids are a concise way to visualise age and sex structure. An expansive pyramid has a wide base and indicates high birth rates and a young population; a constrictive pyramid shows a narrower base and is typical of ageing societies with low fertility; a stationary pyramid has roughly similar cohorts and indicates stable growth. Alongside pyramids, key metrics include the dependency ratio (the proportion of dependents to working-age people), the median age (the age that divides the population into two equal halves), the sex ratio (males per 100 females) and rates such as crude birth rate, crude death rate and total fertility rate. Interpreting these metrics together gives a fuller picture: a country with a high youth dependency ratio will need investment in education and jobs, while one with a high elderly dependency ratio will face pressures on pensions and healthcare. It is also important to consider cohort effects and recent events: a baby-boom cohort will shift through the pyramid and change needs over decades, while conflict or epidemics can produce gaps in specific age groups.

## Demographic change and its consequences
Demographic change follows common patterns described by the Demographic Transition Model (DTM): societies move from high birth and death rates (stage 1) to falling death rates then falling birth rates (stages 2 and 3), and eventually to low birth and death rates and ageing populations (stages 4 and 5). The pace and timing differ between countries, producing diverse consequences. Youthful populations in many low-income countries can produce a “demographic dividend” if large cohorts enter productive employment; this requires investment in education, health and job creation. Failure to generate employment can instead produce high unemployment, social unrest and increased migration pressures. Conversely, in many high-income countries an ageing population increases public spending on healthcare and pensions and can reduce economic growth unless offset by productivity gains or migration. Rural areas often face depopulation as young people move to cities, leaving elderly populations behind and causing service decline, while some cities experience rapid growth and strains on housing, transport and sanitation. Understanding these consequences requires linking demographic metrics to economic, social and spatial contexts and considering policy responses such as family policies, retirement age adjustments and pro-immigration measures.

## Migration: causes and types
Migration is driven by a mix of push and pull factors. Push factors include poverty, unemployment, land degradation, conflict, persecution and environmental hazards such as drought or flooding. Pull factors are opportunities for better employment, education, safety, family reunification and improved services. Distinguishing between voluntary economic migration and forced migration (refugees and internally displaced persons) is important because the causes, legal protections and likely impacts differ. Internal migration, most commonly rural-to-urban flows, is a central process in urbanisation. International migration includes temporary labour migration, permanent settlement, student migration and forced displacement across borders. There is also return migration and circulatory migration, where people move back and forth between places. Policies, border controls and international agreements shape the scale and routes of migration, and changing economic conditions or conflict can produce sudden shifts, as seen in major refugee movements in the twenty-first century.

## Social, economic and spatial impacts of migration
Migration produces complex and often contested impacts on both sending and receiving areas. For origin regions, emigration can relieve pressure on resources and provide remittances that support household livelihoods and local investment, but it can also remove skilled workers (brain drain), reduce the working-age population and alter family structures through long-term separation. For destination regions, migrants can fill labour shortages, contribute taxes and enrich cultural life, but rapid inflows may strain housing, public services and social cohesion if planning and integration policies are weak. Cities that receive large numbers of migrants can benefit from a flexible workforce and entrepreneurial activity, yet may experience informal housing growth and pressure on transport systems. Forced migration adds further layers: host communities may face humanitarian challenges and security debates, while displaced populations experience vulnerability and disrupted livelihoods. The spatial pattern of migration also matters: selective migration of young adults to certain cities can leave peripheral or rural areas with older populations and shrinkage, creating economic and political imbalances within countries. Evaluating impacts therefore involves weighing short-term pressures against long-term benefits and examining how policy, economic context and community responses shape outcomes.

## Data interpretation and case-study thinking in practice
In essays and assessments you will often be asked to discuss consequences or evaluate management strategies. Strong answers combine general principles with specific, well-explained examples. For example, when discussing the implications of a projected population structure for Malawi in 2050, it is useful to explain what a youthful age profile implies for schooling, employment and political stability, and to consider whether Malawi could realise a demographic dividend through investment in education and jobs. For a Scottish context, discussing an ageing population should consider pressures on the NHS, social care and pensions, as well as potential mitigations such as encouraging higher labour force participation among older workers, targeted immigration to fill skills gaps, or technological solutions in healthcare. When using census or survey data, always comment on timeliness and reliability: if data are several years old or exclude informal settlements, your interpretation should be tentative and you should suggest what additional information would strengthen conclusions. Bringing in a short case study — whether of refugee flows from Syria, economic migration from Eastern Europe to the UK after EU enlargement, or internal rural–urban migration in a given developing country — helps to ground abstract points and demonstrates the ability to apply concepts to real situations.

## Exam technique
Answering population and migration questions successfully requires clarity, evidence and balance. Begin by defining key terms such as population structure, migration, dependency ratio or forced migration so the examiner knows you understand the question. Use an opening paragraph to outline your approach, then develop body paragraphs that alternate explanation, evidence and evaluation: explain a process or concept, give an example or data point, and then assess its significance or limitations. When you use data or case studies, be explicit about their source or limitations if the question allows — note whether data are from a recent census, a modelled projection, or estimates, and discuss possible undercounting or bias. Always weigh both positive and negative impacts where appropriate and consider timescale: some effects are immediate (e.g. pressure on local services after a sudden influx) while others are long term (e.g. changes in dependency ratios). If a question asks you to evaluate management strategies, outline the strategy, explain how it addresses causes or impacts, and critically assess its effectiveness and feasibility in context. In planning essays, aim for a clear conclusion that summarises your judgement and links back to the question. Finally, practise applying these techniques under timed conditions and use past paper questions to get comfortable interpreting population pyramids, calculating and commenting on dependency ratios, and writing balanced evaluations that integrate both human and spatial perspectives.
