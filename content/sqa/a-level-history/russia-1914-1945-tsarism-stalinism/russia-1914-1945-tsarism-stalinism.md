# Russia 1914–45: Tsarism to Stalinism (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: long-term structures and short-term shocks
The period 1914–45 in Russia moves from an autocratic agrarian empire to a highly centralised, industrialised, totalitarian state. Long-standing weaknesses of Tsarist rule — an under-industrialised economy, limited political legitimacy, national minority tensions and a rigid social order dominated by landed elites and a backward peasantry — were exposed and intensified by the shocks of the First World War. Those shocks created a revolutionary opportunity which different actors sought to exploit: liberals, moderate socialists, radical Bolsheviks and conservative military figures. The story that follows is one of revolution and counter-revolution, of policy experiments and forced transformations, and of intense debate among historians about causation, contingency and responsibility. For revision, keep in mind the interaction between structural background (economic, social and political) and contingent events (war, leadership decisions, crises) that shaped outcomes across this quarter-century.

## Tsarism in crisis and the Revolutions of 1917
By 1914 the Romanov dynasty was already strained by industrial unrest, agrarian grievances and political exclusion. Russia’s performance in the First World War made those strains lethal: military defeats, mass casualties, logistical breakdowns and economic dislocation produced food shortages and worker militancy. The February 1917 uprising in Petrograd combined spontaneous strikes, soldiers’ mutinies and political agitation to force the abdication of Nicholas II. The result was a fragile dual power: a Provisional Government with formal authority and a Petrograd Soviet representing workers and soldiers. The Provisional Government’s decision to continue the war, its slow progress on land reform and its inability to stabilise the economy undermined its legitimacy. Into this opening stepped the Bolsheviks, whose April Theses called for "All power to the Soviets" and immediate withdrawal from the war. By October 1917, organised, disciplined and exploiting the failures of the Provisional Government, the Bolsheviks seized key centres of power in Petrograd in what they called a socialist revolution. Key short-term facts to remember here are the abdication in February, the Kornilov affair in August which weakened the Provisional Government, and Lenin’s October return and leadership of the seizure of power.

## Civil War, state-building and Lenin’s policies
The Bolshevik seizure precipitated a multi-sided Civil War (roughly 1918–21) between the Red forces loyal to the Bolshevik regime and a diverse set of opposition forces commonly grouped as the Whites, alongside peasant insurgencies and foreign interventions. The Bolsheviks’ victory owed something to Red organisational superiority under Trotsky’s military leadership, the strategic advantages of centralised control and rail hubs, the political flexibility of the Bolsheviks in appealing to order and land-hungry peasants, and the disunity of anti-Bolshevik forces. During the war the Bolsheviks introduced War Communism: centralised requisitioning, nationalisation of industry and strict discipline intended to keep the Red armies supplied. War Communism produced economic collapse and political unrest — the Kronstadt uprising of 1921 was a critical warning. The regime responded by retreating to the New Economic Policy (NEP), a pragmatic reintroduction of market mechanisms and small-scale private trade to stabilise the economy. At the same time, the party moved towards one-party dictatorship, banning factions within the Communist Party and marginalising rivals. The years 1917–24 therefore combine revolutionary transformation with the practical tasks of state-building: creating the Cheka, mobilising resources, negotiating peace with Germany at Brest-Litovsk and projecting revolutionary ideas internationally through the Comintern.

## The struggle for Lenin’s legacy and Stalin’s rise
Lenin’s illness and death in 1924 opened a contest over the Soviet future. The main contenders — Trotsky, associated with permanent revolution and a focus on international revolution; and Stalin, who promoted the idea of "Socialism in One Country" and used party machinery to build alliances — manoeuvred within a Leninist system that lacked clear rules of succession. Stalin’s posts as General Secretary enabled him to place allies and build organisational power, while rivals like Zinoviev and Kamenev were alternately co-opted and isolated. The 1920s saw intense debates about industrial strategy, peasant policy and party democracy. By the late 1920s Stalin had outflanked or sidelined his rivals, defeating Trotsky politically and eventually exiling him. Understanding Stalin’s triumph requires attention to his use of bureaucracy and patronage, the appeal of his program for rapid modernisation, and the weaknesses of his adversaries. For teaching, compare rival interpretations: was Stalin an opportunistic bureaucrat who manipulated structures, or did structural pressures make his rise inevitable? A balanced answer usually combines both perspectives.

## Transformation: industrialisation, collectivisation and terror
From the late 1920s the Soviet leadership launched a "Great Turn" away from NEP towards rapid industrialisation and forced collectivisation intended to create an industrial working class and extract grain to finance investment. The Five-Year Plans set ambitious targets for heavy industry and central planning. Collectivisation of agriculture, enforced through dekulakisation and mass requisitioning, aimed to eliminate independent peasant proprietors and secure state grain supplies. These policies produced dramatic social upheaval: rapid urbanisation, harsh factory discipline, widespread famine in some regions, and enormous human cost in the countryside. The shift in economic policy was accompanied by a political consolidation that culminated in the Great Purges of 1936–38. The assassination of Sergey Kirov in 1934 provided a pretext for waves of arrests, show trials of leading Old Bolsheviks, mass executions and a vast expansion of the Gulag prison camp system. The secret police, then the NKVD, became a central instrument of control and terror. When revising, be ready to weigh different explanations for the purges: were they driven by Stalin’s paranoia and desire for absolute control, by intra-party struggles and local denunciations, or by broader social anxieties as the state modernised? Good answers accept complexity and use evidence from party trials, archival statistics and contemporary accounts.

## Society, culture and the war to 1945
Soviet society by 1941 was profoundly changed. Industrial cities had grown, education and literacy had expanded, and state institutions shaped everyday life: the school system, youth organisations like Komsomol, and campaigns for social transformation impacted gender roles and family life. Women entered the workforce in larger numbers, experienced legal changes in marriage and abortion policies in the 1920s and 1930s, and were simultaneously subject to official campaigns emphasising motherhood in the Stalin era. Cultural life was tightly controlled: socialist realism became the required aesthetic, and dissenting artists and intellectuals faced censorship or repression. The Nazi invasion in June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa) tested the Soviet system. Initial defeats, vast territorial losses and civilian suffering characterised 1941–42, but mobilisation of industry east of the Urals, the resilience of Soviet society, the leadership role of the Red Army and key victories at Moscow and, decisively, Stalingrad in 1942–43 turned the tide. The war reinforced centralised control, elevated the cult of the leader, and produced enormous human and material costs. By 1945 the Soviet Union had emerged as a superpower with a transformed economy and society, but at the price of millions of casualties and enduring political repression.

## Exam technique
When answering Advanced Higher questions on Russia 1914–45 you need to combine secure factual knowledge with analysis, historiography and source evaluation. For Part A essay questions, begin with a clear direct answer to the question and map out the argument in a brief introduction that signals the main points and historiographical stance. Structure the body as a sequence of developed paragraphs, each focused on a specific line of argument: show causation by linking structural factors (economic, social, institutional) with contingent events (war, leadership decisions), and conclude each paragraph by tying evidence back to the question. Use precise examples — dates, policies (NEP, Five-Year Plans, collectivisation), events (February and October Revolutions, Civil War, Kronstadt, Kirov’s assassination, Great Purges, Operation Barbarossa) and individuals (Nicholas II, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Bukharin) — to support your claims. Integrate historiography: demonstrate awareness of competing schools (for example, intentionalist versus structuralist approaches to Stalinism, or debates over the reasons for Bolshevik victory) and show how historiographical views help interpret the evidence. A balanced conclusion must answer the question directly and reflect the complexity of causes and consequences.

For Part B source questions, always begin by identifying the provenance: who wrote the source, when, for what audience and purpose. Use provenance to assess bias and usefulness, and then analyse the content closely: what claim is being made, what evidence is offered, and how does that fit with your wider knowledge? When asked to evaluate usefulness, consider both what the source can reliably tell you and what it cannot. For contextualisation questions, place the source within immediate historical events (for example, positioning a 1917 Bolshevik proclamation in the context of the Kornilov affair and mass desertions) and in historiographical debate. For two-source comparisons, avoid simply listing differences; instead, explain why the sources diverge by reference to their provenance and to the broader evidence.

Time management matters: in a three-hour paper allocate time according to the marks available, leave time to plan and proofread, and make sure essays are proportionate in depth to their mark value. In the project–dissertation, choose a sharply focused question that allows depth and historiographical engagement, plan clearly with milestones, use a mix of primary and secondary sources, and ensure accurate referencing and a concise abstract that states the issue, method and conclusion. Always be critical of your sources, selective in the evidence you deploy, and explicit where interpretations remain contested. That approach — clear argument, well-chosen evidence, and historiographical awareness — is what converts knowledge into high-level answers.
