# 25-mark essay technique and exam practice (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Reading and understanding the question
The single most important step in answering a 25‑mark question well is to read the question slowly and deliberately, and to make sure you understand exactly what it asks. Pay particular attention to the command words: “To what extent…”, “How far…”, “How valid is this view?”, and “How justified is this view?” all demand a balanced judgement rather than a simple narrative. When a question names a factor, you must treat that factor as part of a range of possible causes or influences and assess its relative importance. Underline or circle the key terms and rewrite the question in your own words before you start planning. This helps you avoid the common mistake of writing everything you know about a topic rather than addressing the issue posed.

Contextual awareness is essential at this stage. Make a brief note of the chronological and geographic limits the question implies and jot down two or three immediate factors that seem relevant. A short five‑minute plan at the start of each essay saves time and prevents you from drifting into irrelevant material. In Advanced Higher work, examiners expect more than narrative: they expect you to engage with competing explanations and to position your argument in relation to historiographical debate.

## Planning the 25‑mark essay: structure and timing
You must manage both structure and time. In the SQA Advanced Higher question paper Part A is worth 50 marks in total and contains two 25‑mark essays. With three hours for the whole paper, a practical allocation is to allow around 45–50 minutes for each 25‑mark essay, spending about 5–8 minutes planning, 35–40 minutes writing, and leaving a couple of minutes for a quick review. This leaves the remainder of the time for Part B (the source questions), but adapt this plan to your own strengths and practice under timed conditions.

Your plan should set out a clear thesis and the sequence of arguments you will use to support it. A coherent structure generally works best: an introduction that defines terms and announces your judgement, a sequence of analytical paragraphs each focused on a single line of argument, a paragraph that deals with counter‑arguments or alternative explanations, and a reasoned conclusion that weighs up the evidence. The introduction does not need to be long, but it should identify the main factors you will discuss and make clear the direction of your argument. Good planning also helps you to ensure balance — essays that argue from a single perspective with no engagement with alternatives rarely achieve the top mark bands.

## Building and sustaining a line of argument
Top‑band responses are built around a sustained and developing line of argument, not a string of unconnected paragraphs. Each paragraph should begin with a clear analytical claim, followed by evidence and explanation, and end with a sentence that links the point back to the question. Evidence can be factual recall, specific examples, statistics, policy changes, or the effects of events. Where appropriate, integrate primary material or well‑known examples to illustrate points: a specific battle, a piece of legislation, an economic statistic, or the actions of a named leader. But always use evidence to support explanation rather than letting facts stand alone.

Make sure your argument develops rather than simply repeats similar points. Progression might take the form of moving from structural causes to immediate triggers, from national to international perspectives, or from short‑term to long‑term effects. Devote one paragraph at least to assessing alternative viewpoints: present the strongest case against your thesis, then explain why it is less convincing than your main explanation. This demonstration of critical engagement is what lifts an essay from competent to excellent.

## Using historiography and evidence effectively
Advanced Higher essays must show awareness of historical interpretations. Responses without any reference to historiography cannot score above a specific threshold, so do not treat historiography as optional. You do not need a library of quotations to make your answer interpretative; a paragraph or two that weaves historians’ debates into your analysis is sufficient. Effective historiographical use means naming a view, summarising its claim, and explaining how your evidence supports or challenges it. For example, in a question about the causes of Weimar collapse you might refer to structuralist accounts that emphasise long‑term weaknesses in the political system and contrast these with intentionalist explanations focusing on Nazi organisation and strategy, explaining how the evidence you have presented aligns more closely with one interpretation or the other.

Primary sources can be used in Part A to illustrate or test an argument, though Part B is the main space for source analysis. When you draw on primary material, comment on provenance briefly and use it to weigh the strength of the example. With secondary sources, be selective. Refer to historians whose views you know well, and explain their arguments succinctly. Avoid name‑dropping; the examiner values how you use historiography to illuminate the debate, not how many names you can list.

## Writing technique in the exam: introductions, paragraphs and conclusions
The quality of expression matters. Write a focused introduction that defines any ambiguous terms and states your judgement. For a “To what extent…?” question, a balanced thesis such as “X was a significant factor, but Y and Z were more decisive because…” tells the examiner you will weigh factors. Each body paragraph should deal with a distinct strand of the argument: begin with a topic sentence that signals the point, follow with evidence and analysis, incorporate historiographical comment where relevant, and end by linking back to the question. Transitional phrases that signpost comparison and evaluation help the reader to follow the argument.

A strong conclusion does not merely repeat the introduction. It reassesses the evidence and historiography considered, explains why your judgement follows from that analysis, and offers a final qualifying statement. Examiners look for a measured and reflective conclusion rather than an overstated claim. Reserve a few minutes at the end to read through what you have written and to correct any glaring errors and unclear sentences. Legibility and clarity reduce the risk of losing marks for poor communication of otherwise sound analysis.

## Practising effectively: timed essays and feedback
Practice under timed conditions is essential. Regularly complete full Part A practices in the time you will have in the exam, and then compare your answers with mark schemes or specimen marking instructions to identify where you lost marks. Focus practice not only on content but on structure, use of historiography, and the precision of argument. Working with peers or teachers to get feedback is highly beneficial: someone else can spot recurring weaknesses such as insufficient balance, weak conclusions, or under‑used historiography.

When planning revision, rotate topics so you can practise constructing arguments across the range of fields in the specification. Drill command words — answer a “How far…?” question one week and a “How valid is this view?” question the next — so you can switch modes of argument quickly. Keep concise, organised notes that include useful facts, key dates, brief summaries of historians’ positions, and a handful of primary source examples you can deploy to support your claims.

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
Several recurring problems undermine otherwise promising essays. The first is drifting into narrative: long descriptive passages with little analysis will limit your marks. Always ask how the evidence you present supports your argument about causes, consequences, or significance. A second pitfall is weak engagement with counter‑arguments. Ignoring alternative explanations makes your essay one‑sided; include the strongest opposing view and explain why it is less persuasive. A third trap is shallow historiography: a cursory name‑check without integrating the interpretation into the analysis gains little. Finally, avoid overlong quotations and unsupported sweeping generalities. Precise, succinct use of evidence and historians’ ideas is more convincing than broad assertions.

To avoid these mistakes, use a simple internal checklist as you write: does each paragraph make an analytical point? Is that point supported by concrete evidence? Have I considered at least one alternative view? Have I linked this back to the question? If the answer to any of these is no, revise the paragraph before moving on.

## Exam technique
Before you write, read the whole paper so you know what the sources and questions demand, then choose the section you know best. Allocate time in advance and stick to it, planning for five to eight minutes before each 25‑mark essay to set a clear thesis and paragraph plan. Underline command words and define any key terms in your introduction. Structure each paragraph so it begins with an analytical topic sentence, develops that point with evidence and explanation, brings in historiography where it strengthens the analysis, and finishes by linking back to the question. Reserve one paragraph for the best counter‑argument and then refute it or explain its limits; this demonstrates critical thinking. Conclude by weighing the factors discussed and offering a measured judgement that follows from the evidence you have presented. Watch your time, aim for clarity and progression rather than encyclopaedic coverage, and leave a few minutes at the end to proofread. Regular timed practice, targeted feedback, and careful revision of historians’ debates will make this approach second nature by the exam.
