# Feudal society and the medieval church, 1066–1406 (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: what the topic covers and why it matters
This topic examines the structures of power, landholding and belief across England and Scotland from the Norman Conquest to the later Middle Ages. It combines political history — how kings sought to control territories and people — with social and economic change, and the role of the church as both a spiritual authority and a major landowner and institution. Understanding feudal society and the medieval church is essential because it explains the everyday organisation of medieval life, the sources of royal power and resistance, and the long-term processes that led to the decline of the feudal order and the rise of more centralized states and market economies.

## The nature of feudal society: relationships, land and obligations
Feudal society is best understood as a network of personal relationships based on landholding and reciprocal obligations rather than a single, uniform system. After 1066 the Normans imposed a clearer hierarchy in England: the king held ultimate authority as owner of all land and granted estates to tenants-in-chief in return for military service; those tenants in turn created sub-tenancies down to knights who owed service and counsel. In Scotland the process was slower and patchier, but from the reign of David I (1124–1153) Anglo-Norman forms of tenure and administration were increasingly introduced. Economically, manorialism organised local production: lords exercised jurisdiction over peasant communities, extracted rents and labour services, and ran demesne agriculture to support the household and lordly obligations. Feudal obligations could be rendered as military service, hospitality, judicial duties and, increasingly from the twelfth century, scutage — a cash payment in lieu of service — which signalled a gradual monetisation of obligations. Knights and castellans occupied an important social role as local military elites and symbols of chivalry, but their practical importance changed as warfare and royal administration evolved.

## The medieval church: spiritual authority, landholding and social role
The church was a multi-faceted presence in medieval society. It provided parish ministry through secular clergy, while the regular church — monasteries and religious orders — produced spiritual, economic and cultural influence. Monasteries, from Benedictine to Cistercian houses, were major landowners, centres of agricultural innovation, literacy and charity, and locations for burial and pilgrimage. From the late eleventh century the Gregorian reforms and the Investiture Controversy emphasised clerical independence, papal authority and moral reform; these currents shaped relations between kings and bishops. The arrival of mendicant friars in the thirteenth century, notably Franciscans and Dominicans, added new urban religious energies focused on preaching and pastoral care. The church’s powers included tithes, jurisdiction in spiritual matters, control of marriage and burial rites, and the ability to excommunicate or place regions under interdict — political tools that could have severe social and diplomatic consequences. Clerical offices also provided avenues for governance: bishops and abbots were often royal administrators, diplomats and judges, linking ecclesiastical and secular realms.

## David I and the transformation of Scotland
David I is often associated with a “Davidian revolution” that accelerated the integration of Scotland into Anglo-Norman political and ecclesiastical systems. He introduced feudal landholding practices, granted estates to Anglo-Norman knights, established royal burghs to stimulate trade and economic growth, and placed sheriffs and royal officials to improve administration and law and order. Ecclesiastical reform was promoted by foundation of monasteries such as Melrose, and by bringing continental religious models to Scotland. These changes did strengthen central authority: written charters, the extension of royal justice and the creation of a landed aristocracy loyal to the crown increased the king’s resources. Yet the expansion had limits. Much of Gaelic Scotland retained traditional forms of lordship, David’s reliance on foreign knights created tensions with native magnates, and the crown’s reach was constrained by geography and limited bureaucratic capacity. The reforms laid important foundations but relied on local acceptance and ongoing negotiation with the nobility and the church.

## Henry II and the consolidation of royal authority in England
Henry II’s reign (1154–1189) provides a textbook case of systematic royal reform. He rebuilt royal finances and the royal demesne, reasserted jurisdiction through itinerant justices and the development of common law, and introduced administrative measures and reforms of feudal obligations such as scutage and fines. Legal innovations, including royal courts and the jury system, drew disputes into the king’s purview and thereby extended central authority. Henry’s attempts to regulate the church’s privileges culminated in the Constitutions of Clarendon (1164), which sought to restrict ecclesiastical courts and assert royal rights over clerical justice; this clash produced the tragic conflict with Thomas Becket, culminating in Becket’s murder in 1170 and a significant public crisis that forced Henry into a partial retreat. Henry’s authority was powerful but not absolute: his empire across England, Normandy and other territories required constant negotiation with powerful barons and foreign rulers, and military force was expensive. The structure he put in place, however, significantly strengthened the monarchy’s legal and fiscal foundations.

## King John: attempts to increase authority and the limits revealed
King John’s reign (1199–1216) shows how royal ambition, military setbacks and poor relations with elites could undermine royal power. John lost Normandy in 1204, which weakened the Angevin Empire and undermined his prestige. His financial demands, arbitrary justice, and quarrels with the barons provoked widespread hostility, while his long dispute with the papacy resulted in his excommunication and an interdict on England (1208–1213) before he eventually submitted to papal overlordship in 1213 to secure support. The baronial rebellion of 1215 produced Magna Carta, a negotiated settlement that attempted to restrain royal prerogative, regulate feudal rights and guarantee certain baronial liberties. Magna Carta reveals both the limits of feudal monarchy and the emergence of constitutional constraints: John’s attempts to increase revenues and central control provoked resistance, and his failures show the dependence of kings on baronial cooperation, clerical approval, and military resources.

## Reasons for the decline of feudal society, c. late 13th–14th centuries
The decline of feudal society was gradual and multi-causal, involving demographic, military, economic and social shifts. The Black Death of 1348–49 had the most immediate effect by halving or sharply reducing populations across affected regions. Labour shortages empowered peasants and labourers to demand higher wages and mobility; the traditional manorial economy came under strain as lords faced difficulty enforcing customary services. Attempts to freeze wages through legislation such as the Statute of Labourers (1351) had limited long-term success and generated resentment. The Peasants’ Revolt of 1381 in England exposed the social tensions produced by taxation, labour controls and the expanding fiscal demands of the crown, but the revolt’s failure also demonstrated that social change was often negotiated rather than wholly revolutionary. Economic transformation contributed too: the growth of towns, trade and a money economy made rents and wages more important than labour services, and the wool trade and merchant capitalism increased the influence of non-feudal groups. Military change reduced the centrality of the mounted knight; pike and longbow tactics in the Hundred Years War and, later, gunpowder weapons made heavy cavalry less decisive and encouraged kings to recruit paid infantry and use professional armies, eroding the military foundations of feudal obligations. Cultural shifts followed as social mobility, urbanization and changing ideologies altered attitudes toward hierarchy and service.

## Teaching themes, examples and ways to develop arguments
For teaching and revision, it is helpful to separate conceptual clarity from evidence. Distinguish feudalism as a web of personal loyalties based on land from manorialism as the economic system of agricultural production. Use key case studies to anchor arguments: William I’s post-1066 redistribution of land and the Domesday survey demonstrate the imposition of Norman order in England; David I’s charters and burgh foundations illustrate Scottish adaptation of feudal structures; Henry II’s legal reforms and the Becket controversy provide a clear example of the tension between royal and ecclesiastical authority; King John, the loss of Normandy and Magna Carta show how fiscal pressure and political isolation can limit kingship. In discussions of the church, balance its spiritual and social roles with its political functions: monastic records illuminate agricultural and literacy roles, while papal letters and episodes like interdict and excommunication show the church’s diplomatic power. To evaluate change or continuity, always link cause with consequence and weigh short-term shocks (plague, war) against long-term trends (monetisation, urban growth). Encourage students to deploy specific evidence — named statutes, battles, charters and institutions — and to compare England and Scotland where appropriate, noting differences in timing and intensity.

## Exam technique
Answering essay and source questions successfully depends on clear structure, precise evidence and balanced evaluation. For extended-response questions such as “To what extent…?” or “How important…?”, begin with a brief thesis that directly addresses the question, then develop balanced paragraphs that each examine a factor with specific evidence, evaluating strengths and limits before moving on. Use named examples (for instance, Becket and the Constitutions of Clarendon, Magna Carta 1215, the Black Death 1348–49, the Statute of Labourers 1351, the Peasants’ Revolt 1381) to support points, and link each paragraph back to the question to maintain focus. For Scottish-focused comparative or evaluation questions, explicitly compare developments in Scotland and England when relevant, or explain why comparison is limited. Time management is crucial: allocate time to plan, write and review; a short plan prevents narrative drift and ensures balanced coverage. For source-based questions, always identify origin, purpose and content, then assess usefulness or interpretation by explaining what the source reveals and what it omits, bringing in precise recalled knowledge to fill gaps. When asked to compare two sources, identify their different viewpoints and explain how each is shaped by perspective and context, using external knowledge to adjudicate between them. Conclude by summing up the relative weight of evidence and offering a reasoned judgement. Practise with past or specimen questions, and ensure answers integrate factual recall with analytical evaluation rather than listing facts without judgement.
