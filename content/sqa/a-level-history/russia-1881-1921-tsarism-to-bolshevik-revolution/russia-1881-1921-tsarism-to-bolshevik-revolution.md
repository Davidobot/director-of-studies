# Russia 1881–1921: decline of Tsarism and Bolshevik Revolution (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction and overview
The period 1881–1921 in Russia charts the collapse of a centuries-old autocracy and the emergence of Bolshevik rule. It begins with the conservative reaction after the assassination of Alexander II, passes through the upheaval of 1905 and cautious modernising reforms, moves into the catastrophe of the First World War and the two revolutions of 1917, and ends with Bolshevik victory in the Civil War and the beginnings of a one-party state. To understand this transformation you must combine structural background — the nature of the Tsarist regime, social and economic change, national minorities — with the sequence of immediate crises and the choices of political actors. Key themes are authority and legitimacy, the role of ideology versus short-term triggers, the relationship between centre and periphery in a multi-national empire, and the practical resources that make or break revolutionary movements: armies, railways, cities and communications.

## The Tsarist state and its vulnerabilities before 1905
After Alexander II’s reforms (most notably the 1861 emancipation of the serfs) the Russian state remained deeply autocratic. The Tsar’s government relied on an unreformed bureaucracy, regional landowners, the army and the Orthodox Church for legitimacy. Security organs such as the Okhrana and the army could suppress outbreaks, and periodic modernization — expanding railways and industrial growth, especially around St Petersburg and Moscow — created new capacities. Yet structural weaknesses were serious. Rapid industrialisation produced an urban working class concentrated in a few large factories with poor conditions, while the countryside remained dominated by peasant unrest, land hunger and agrarian backwardness. A vast array of political opposition had grown: liberal constitutionalists (the Kadets), radical narodniki and Socialist Revolutionaries who appealed to peasants, and Marxist Social Democrats who organised industrial workers and split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in 1903. National minorities — Poles, Finns, Ukrainians, Caucasian and Central Asian peoples — resented Russification and central control. These tensions meant that while the regime looked durable in normal times, it depended heavily on the loyalty of the armed forces and the willingness of elites to accept repression. Thus, in 1905 the state had the instruments of control but not the social cohesion to withstand a wide, simultaneous crisis.

## The 1905 Revolution: causes, course and consequences
The immediate catalyst for the 1905 upheaval was military defeat in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), which exposed the military’s weaknesses and the government’s incompetence. Bloody Sunday (January 1905), when peaceful petitioners in St Petersburg were fired upon, sparked mass outrage and political strikes. The revolution was composite: urban workers staged strikes and formed Soviet-like councils; peasants attacked landowners; nationalities seized opportunities for autonomy; and mutinies, notably on the battleship Potemkin, illustrated cracks in military loyalty. The tsarist regime responded with a mixture of repression and concession. Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto promising a Duma and civil liberties, which split the opposition and restored a measure of order. However, subsequent Fundamental Laws (1906) reinforced autocratic prerogatives and limited the Duma’s power, while the regime pursued severe repression of radical groups. The 1905 events had long-term effects: they created a precedent for mass political organisation (Soviets and parties), revealed the regime’s fragility, and produced a generation of activists and grievances that were not resolved but deferred.

## Reaction and reform, 1905–1914: Stolypin and the limits of change
Between 1906 and 1914 the tsarist regime attempted to stabilise itself through limited political reform, coercive modernisation and agrarian policy. The Duma existed but its powers were restricted; successive governments faced opposition and were often short-lived. Pyotr Stolypin, prime minister from 1906, pursued a twofold strategy: force against revolutionaries and a programme of agrarian reform intended to create a conservative peasant proprietorship. Stolypin’s land policies aimed to dissolve communal landholding (the mir), encourage private farming, and thus produce a class that would support the regime. At the same time, repression — executions, exile to Siberia and suppression of political activity — remained central. Industrial growth continued unevenly, and political life became more pluralistic in the cities, where socialists and liberals competed for influence. These measures mitigated immediate unrest but did not solve the deeper problems: rural land hunger persisted, political demands for real representation were unmet, and the Duma’s weaknesses left a vacuum for extra-parliamentary politics. By 1914 the Tsarist state had been strengthened in some administrative respects but not transformed into a stable constitutional monarchy; its legitimacy among workers, peasants and many intellectuals remained low.

## World War I and the February Revolution of 1917
The First World War exposed and accelerated the regime’s weaknesses. Military defeats, the collapse of morale, catastrophic casualties and shortages at home brought discontent to a new pitch. The army, previously a pillar of the regime, suffered huge losses and increasingly questioned orders; the rail network could not sustain front-line supply and civilian logistics; and inflation and food scarcity made urban life intolerable. The immediate sequence in Petrograd in February (March by the modern calendar) 1917 began with strikes and bread riots. Workers and mutinous soldiers joined together, the Petrograd garrison refused to fire on demonstrators, and the Petrograd Soviet arose as a rival locus of power. Nicholas II’s abdication after losing the loyalty of commanders and ministers ended Romanov autocracy. Crucially, a dual power situation emerged: a Provisional Government composed largely of liberal and moderate figures shared power awkwardly with Soviets representing workers and soldiers. The Provisional Government’s decision to continue the war, its failure to redistribute land, and its perceived weakness allowed radical forces to erode its authority. The February Revolution was both a collapse driven by immediate wartime crises and the culmination of long-standing structural pressures.

## The Bolsheviks and the October Revolution
By October 1917 the Bolsheviks had moved from a marginal revolutionary party to the strongest organised force in many urban soviets. Lenin’s return in April 1917 and his April Theses articled a simple, popular programme: “Peace, Land, Bread” and “All power to the Soviets.” The Bolsheviks skilfully presented themselves as the party of decisive change. Critical moments include the July Days unrest and the Kornilov affair in late August/September, when a failed right-wing coup attempt discredited the Provisional Government and boosted Bolshevik credibility as defenders of the revolution. Operationally, the Bolsheviks, led politically by Lenin and organised militarily by Trotsky, seized key communication points in Petrograd in October, using the Military Revolutionary Committee as their instrument. Their success owed much to concentrated urban support, disciplined party organisation, clear slogans that matched popular desires, and the weakness and indecision of the Provisional Government. The October seizure was relatively swift and established Bolshevik control in the central cities; it was, however, neither inevitable nor a simple mass uprising but a conquest by a well-prepared minority in a volatile situation.

## Civil War, 1918–1921: why the Reds won
After 1917 Russia descended into a multi-sided civil war. The Bolsheviks (Reds) faced a fragmented opposition — monarchists, liberals and former generals (the Whites), nationalist movements, and local peasant armies. Several interconnected advantages explain Red victory. First, territorial and logistical control mattered: Bolshevik power centred on the industrialised, populous core of European Russia, including Moscow and Petrograd, which gave access to factories, armaments, railway hubs and manpower. Second, centralised organisation and disciplined command under leaders such as Trotsky enabled efficient mobilisation and movement of forces; the Red Army’s recruitment and coherent command structure contrasted with White disunity, rival leaders and inconsistent political programs. Third, the Bolsheviks implemented ruthless policies, including war communism and the Cheka’s suppression of opponents, which, while brutal and deeply unpopular in places, secured resources and internal control. Fourth, peasant attitudes generally favoured the Reds or remained neutral rather than supporting Whites, because the Whites were associated with a return to landlord rule and the restoration of the old order. Finally, foreign intervention on behalf of the Whites was limited, poorly coordinated and politically unpopular; it often bolstered Bolshevik propaganda about foreign meddling. By 1921 the Reds had consolidated control of the core territory and crushed large-scale organised opposition, allowing the Bolsheviks to begin the transition from wartime measures to state-building under one-party rule.

## From revolution to regime: consequences and continuities
The Bolshevik triumph transformed Russia’s political map: a monopoly of power by the Communist Party, nationalisation of industry, and the seizure and redistribution of land in the short term. The Civil War and the policies of war communism, however, inflicted severe social and economic damage, including famine in 1921 and industrial collapse. The Bolsheviks responded with pragmatic measures such as the New Economic Policy to stabilise the economy, but political repression and centralisation of authority continued and were deeply embedded by the end of this period. Many pre-revolutionary problems — ethnic tensions, rural poverty and the challenge of modernisation — remained pressing, now reframed within a revolutionary state committed to socialist transformation. For historians and students, the period demonstrates how the interplay of structural weaknesses, contingent crises and decisive political leadership can combine to overturn long-standing regimes.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on Russia 1881–1921 demands clarity about causation, chronology and balance. For an evaluation or “To what extent…” question start with a brief introduction that sets out the long-term context and states a clear tentative judgement. Structure your main body as distinct paragraphs each addressing a single factor — for example political repression, the impact of war, the role of revolutionary leadership, and peasant attitudes — and within each paragraph give specific evidence (dates, names, events), explain how the factor operated, and assess its importance relative to others. Use connective sentences to weigh factors against one another and avoid a simple narrative substitution where analysis is required. For questions asking about the success of the Bolsheviks or the reasons for the 1905/1917 revolutions, combine short-term triggers with long-term causes: explain why a particular trigger mattered because of underlying structural weaknesses. When asked to assess change or continuity, contrast specific policies or institutions before and after key dates (for example, the Duma’s creation in 1905, the Provisional Government’s policies in 1917, or war communism in 1918–21).

If a question requires judgement about significance, be selective: choose two or three well-evidenced factors rather than attempting to mention everything. Precise factual detail strengthens argument: use dates (1905, 1906, February and October 1917), individuals (Nicholas II, Stolypin, Lenin, Trotsky) and events (Bloody Sunday, Kornilov affair, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in context) to anchor points. In the final paragraph present a balanced conclusion that directly answers the question and gives a measured degree: for example, “The war was the decisive catalyst, but without the structural weaknesses built up since emancipation, the Tsarist regime might have survived the immediate crisis.” For source-based or two-source comparative questions practice reading sources for origin, purpose and tone and always combine source points with recalled knowledge that confirms, complicates or contradicts the source. Time management is crucial: in a 90-minute paper allocate time according to marks, leave a few minutes to proofread and ensure every paragraph links back to the question.
