# USA 1918–1968: New Deal and the Civil Rights movement (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview and historical context
The period 1918–1968 in the United States is shaped by the legacies of the First World War, the boom-and-bust of the 1920s and 1930s, the transformative experience of the Second World War, and the intensifying struggle for civil rights. Politically and constitutionally, it is a time when federal power expands, the expectations placed on the national government change dramatically, and social movements press demands for equal citizenship. Economically, the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression forced new forms of state intervention in the economy; the New Deal (and its later legislation) redefined the relationship between citizen, market and state. Racially, the period moves from entrenched Jim Crow segregation and limited federal will to protect Black Americans, to a mass Civil Rights movement whose victories and limits by 1968 reshaped American society. Understanding the interplay of economic pressure, international context and the struggle for rights is central to explaining why the USA changed so much in these fifty years.

## Immigration and nativism in the 1920s
After the First World War attitudes to immigration hardened. The war, wartime migration and the 1917–20 Red Scare created fears of political radicalism and social instability. These anxieties combined with long-standing racial and ethnic prejudice and with economic worries about jobs to produce a new, restrictive immigration regime. The Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924 established national origins quotas which sharply reduced immigration from southern and eastern Europe and effectively barred large-scale immigration from Asia. The law reflected ideas associated with eugenics and pseudo-scientific racial hierarchies, favouring northern and western European migrants. Nativist sentiment was visible in public life: the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1920s, local expulsions and restrictive municipal ordinances all signalled an inward-looking, conservative turn. At the same time isolationist foreign policy and suspicion of foreigners in public discourse hardened the cultural climate and constrained the pluralism of the earlier decades.

## Causes of the economic crisis, 1929–33
The Great Depression was the product of multiple interacting weaknesses in the US and global economy. During the 1920s the US experienced remarkable industrial growth but also chronic problems of overproduction and underconsumption: mass production outpaced the ability of workers to buy goods because wages did not rise in step with productivity for many. The stock market boom fuelled by speculation, margin buying and a fragile banking system left the economy vulnerable. When the Wall Street Crash of October 1929 destroyed confidence, banks failed, credit tightened and investment collapsed. International factors exacerbated the downturn: fragile international debt arrangements, protectionist policies such as the Smoot–Hawley Tariff, and the contraction of world trade deepened the recession. The result was mass unemployment, bank runs and a collapse in prices and incomes that demanded far-reaching policy responses.

## The New Deal: goals, policies and evaluation
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal (from 1933) sought short-term relief, recovery of the economy and long-term reform. Its first phase, the “First Hundred Days,” set up emergency banking measures, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and reforms to restore confidence. Public works programmes such as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) provided employment and infrastructure. Regulatory reforms established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and attempted to stabilise industry through the National Industrial Recovery Act (NRA), though the Supreme Court later declared key elements unconstitutional. The Second New Deal (mid-1930s) emphasised social welfare and security, with Social Security providing old-age pensions and unemployment insurance, and the Wagner Act strengthening labour rights.

Assessing effectiveness requires nuance. The New Deal did not end the Depression; full recovery came only with the massive wartime mobilisation of the early 1940s. Nonetheless, it delivered important relief to millions, expanded the role and capacity of the federal government, stabilised the banking system and created enduring institutions and expectations: citizens now looked to Washington for economic security and social insurance. Politically the New Deal realigned American politics, drawing many working-class voters, immigrants and significant numbers of African Americans into the Democratic coalition.

However, New Deal policies also had clear limits and contradictions. Many programmes were administered locally and so reflected the racial hierarchies of the South; agricultural and domestic workers—jobs heavily concentrated among Black Americans—were often excluded from Social Security and other protections. Discriminatory relief practices and segregation in public works meant that the New Deal’s benefits were uneven. The Supreme Court battles and the 1937 “court-packing” controversy also show the institutional resistance the New Deal faced. Overall, the New Deal expanded federal power and created new social safety nets but left deep racial and regional inequalities intact.

## Obstacles to civil rights up to 1941
From the end of Reconstruction through the 1930s, legal, social and political structures systematically denied Black Americans full citizenship. Jim Crow laws in the South enforced segregation in public life; the Supreme Court’s Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) decision had established the “separate but equal” doctrine that legitimised segregation. Voting rights were effectively denied by poll taxes, literacy tests and the white primary, while violence and intimidation by lynch mobs and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan enforced racial subordination. Economic dependency, sharecropping and tenant farming trapped many in cycles of poverty and limited political agency.

In the North and West discrimination was often de facto rather than de jure: housing covenants, employment discrimination and segregated schools and neighbourhoods reproduced inequality. Political obstacles included the lack of a committed federal enforcement mechanism; presidents and Congress were reluctant to confront Southern white interests. Divisions within the Black community—between those advocating accommodation, legal challenges, church-based organising or more radical approaches—also complicated the emergence of a unified movement. Nevertheless, by 1941 organisations such as the NAACP were building legal strategies and grassroots networks that would later be crucial.

## Reasons for the development of the Civil Rights campaign after 1945
Several linked factors explain why a sustained nationwide Civil Rights campaign emerged after 1945. The Second World War was pivotal: Black servicemen’s wartime experiences, and the Double V campaign that linked victory abroad with victory against racism at home, heightened expectations for equality. The postwar international environment mattered: Cold War rivalry made US racial discrimination an embarrassment in contests for influence among decolonising nations, and American leaders felt pressure to appear consistent with professed democratic ideals. Economic and demographic changes reinforced activism. The Great Migration had produced large Black urban communities in the North and West whose political weight and organisational capacities grew. The NAACP’s long-term legal strategy, led by figures such as Thurgood Marshall, culminated in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which declared school segregation unconstitutional and provided a constitutional spur for wider activism.

Grassroots direct action became central in the late 1950s and 1960s. The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–56) built the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Sit-ins, freedom rides, voter registration drives and mass marches—exemplified by the March on Washington in 1963—used nonviolent protest to expose brutality and force federal intervention. New organisations such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) introduced innovative tactics and broadened the movement’s reach. Media coverage amplified events; televised images of police dogs, fire hoses and violent suppression of peaceful demonstrators generated public sympathy and pressured elected officials.

## Achievements and limitations of the Civil Rights movement to 1968
By 1968 the movement had secured landmark legislative victories and reshaped national law and politics. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed segregation in public accommodations and employment discrimination; the Voting Rights Act of 1965 removed many legal barriers to Black enfranchisement and authorised federal oversight in regions with a history of discrimination; and fair housing measures followed in 1968. Court decisions and federal enforcement compelled desegregation in certain contexts and elevated individual civil rights within the federal framework.

Yet significant limits remained. De jure successes did not erase de facto segregation in housing, schooling and employment. Economic inequality persisted, with Black unemployment and poverty rates significantly higher than white averages and with limited redistribution of wealth or land. Resistance—often violent—appeared in white opposition and in episodes of urban unrest from Watts (1965) to Detroit (1967). The movement itself diversified and radicalised: by the mid-1960s some activists, frustrated by the slow pace of economic change and continuing violence, embraced Black Power and more militant forms of protest, sometimes challenging the nonviolent leadership’s strategy. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 was a tragic marker of both the progress achieved and the unresolved tensions that remained, and it presaged a new and fragmented phase of the struggle for equality.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on USA 1918–1968 focus on clear, balanced argument and precise use of evidence. For “evaluate” or “assess” questions, identify key factors and weigh their relative importance, avoiding a simple list. Use topic sentences that directly answer the question, then explain and illustrate each point with specific examples—legislation, court cases, organisations, dates and named events (for example, Brown v. Board 1954, Montgomery Bus Boycott 1955–56, Civil Rights Act 1964, Voting Rights Act 1965, Emergency Quota Act 1921, Immigration Act 1924, CCC/WPA, Social Security). In essays on the New Deal include its institutional legacy as well as its social limits; on civil rights, distinguish between legal gains and social or economic realities on the ground. Remember to place points in context: link wartime experiences and Cold War pressures to the rise of civil rights, and connect structural economic weaknesses to the 1929 crash.

For source or interpretation questions practise contextualising and evaluating provenance: consider who produced a source, when and why, and what it omits. When asked about effectiveness or change over time, set a clear start and end point and trace continuity and change, giving an overall judgement in the conclusion. Time management is vital: plan a brief structure at the start, allocate time for introduction, development and a conclusion that answers the question directly. Finally, use precise vocabulary—terms like Jim Crow, de jure and de facto segregation, New Deal relief/reform/recovery, enfranchisement and federal enforcement—and, where appropriate, comment on causation by linking political, social and economic factors rather than treating each in isolation.
