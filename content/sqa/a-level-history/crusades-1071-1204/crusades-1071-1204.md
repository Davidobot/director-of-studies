# The Crusades, 1071–1204 (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview and historical context
The crusading movement emerged from a complex set of political, religious and social changes across Europe and the eastern Mediterranean in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries. The date 1071 is significant because the Byzantine defeat at Manzikert weakened imperial control in Anatolia and exposed Byzantium to further Turkish pressure; this created one of the immediate contexts for later appeals for help from the West. By 1095 Pope Urban II had both an opportunity and a motive to call a western response at the Council of Clermont: he could offer spiritual rewards to those prepared to fight, help a fellow Christian empire, and attempt to steer the aggressive tendencies of a feudal nobility into an enterprise that claimed religious purpose. Over the next century crusading produced new political entities on the Levantine coast — the principal Crusader states of Edessa, Antioch, Tripoli and the Kingdom of Jerusalem — reshaped Mediterranean trade, and provoked sustained military and diplomatic contact, often violent, between Latin Christendom and the Muslim world. Between 1071 and 1204 the movement passed from the ecstatic success of the First Crusade to the loss of Jerusalem in 1187 and the mixed outcomes of subsequent expeditions, ending the period with the diversion of the crusading ideal into the Fourth Crusade and the sack of Constantinople in 1204.

## Why the First Crusade was called
The immediate trigger for the First Crusade was an appeal from Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who sought military aid against Seljuk expansion. That practical need met broader western impulses. Papal leaders framed the expedition as an armed pilgrimage: taking the cross promised remission of sins and a penitential outlet for violence endemic to a knightly culture. Urban II’s rhetoric at Clermont appealed to piety, the duty to liberate the Holy Places, and the defence of fellow Christians, but it also offered secular rewards: land, spoils and prestige. Economic and strategic factors mattered too. Control of pilgrimage routes and Mediterranean trade routes attracted the interest of merchants and of the Italian maritime powers. Finally, demographic and social pressures in Europe — opportunities for younger sons, expectations of martial glory, and occasional local crisis such as famine — made an outward-moving crusade attractive to many who sought change or reward beyond the constraints of feudal life.

## Who took the cross and why: motives across classes
The crusading movement drew men from different social backgrounds and for different reasons. At one end were large numbers of knights and high nobles who saw war in the East as a chance for territorial gain, prestige and the consolidation of family reputation. The leadership that ultimately achieved the capture of key cities was largely composed of these magnates: men such as Godfrey of Bouillon, Raymond of Toulouse and Bohemond of Taranto combined martial competence with networks of retinues and resources. At the other end were peasants and poorer urban people who joined the People’s Crusade, led by charismatic preachers; their motivations included religious zeal, the promise of social advancement, and in some cases sheer desperation at home. Clerical encouragement and preaching played a decisive role in mobilising broad participation, while promises of spiritual reward and the language of pilgrimage framed the enterprise as something more than ordinary war. For merchants and cities, commercial advantage and control of ports were powerful incentives to support or profit from crusading ventures. When answering questions about motives it is important to distinguish between the declared religiosity of participants and the tangible secular benefits that drew them.

## Why the First Crusade succeeded
Explaining the extraordinary success of the First Crusade requires attention to a combination of military, political and situational factors. Muslim polities in the late eleventh century were fragmented; the Seljuk Turks had become powerful but their control was not uniform, and local rivalries between Turkish emirs, Fatimid rulers of Egypt and other regional actors created opportunities for a concerted western advance. The crusading armies, despite logistic strains, benefited from disciplined heavy cavalry tactics and from an ability to seize and hold fortified points when local resistance faltered. Byzantine aid — though limited and sometimes mistrusted — provided early logistical support and crucial intelligence in Anatolia. Leadership matters: the array of experienced nobles who survived the initial chaotic marches were capable of strategic sieges at Antioch and Jerusalem. Religious zeal and morale, at least among many contingents, sustained long marches and hard sieges. Finally, misunderstandings and misjudgements among Muslim rulers about western intents delayed a unified response; where cooperation among Muslim forces failed, crusader successes multiplied. When considering the First Crusade’s success in an essay, balance military explanation with political fragmentation and the role of morale and leadership.

## The fall of Jerusalem in 1187 and Saladin’s rise
The crusader states established after 1099 survived for nearly two centuries but carried structural vulnerabilities: limited manpower, dependence on reinforcements and supplies from Europe, internal rivalries among Latin lords, and economic strain from maintaining frontier polities. The death of vigorous leaders and the chronic problem of financing defence left the Kingdom of Jerusalem fragile. Against that background the rise of a unifying Muslim leader, Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn (Saladin), altered the balance. Saladin’s political and military skill enabled him to bring many Syrian and Egyptian forces into a more coherent front, while his reputation and religious legitimacy reinforced Muslim mobilization. The decisive defeat of the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin in 1187 destroyed much of the Kingdom’s field force and allowed Saladin to capture Jerusalem later that year. Jerusalem’s fall was not a single cause event but the culmination of crusader weakness, Saladin’s unification of Muslim power, and battlefield catastrophe. In assessing why Jerusalem fell in 1187, students should weigh the internal problems of the crusader states against Saladin’s organisational achievement and the immediate military disaster at Hattin.

## The Third Crusade: war and settlement
The loss of Jerusalem prompted a major western reaction: the Third Crusade (1189–1192) is conventionally associated with the personalities of Richard I of England, Philip II of France and Frederick I Barbarossa of Germany. The expedition combined dramatic military engagements with extended diplomacy. Frederick’s massive army perished in parts en route when the emperor drowned, and Philip returned to France early, leaving Richard to carry much of the leadership of the western effort. Richard achieved important victories: the capture of Acre and successes along the coast, and his combination of military pressure and skilful negotiation with Saladin won terms that, while falling short of re-taking Jerusalem, secured Christian control of key coastal cities and agreed access for pilgrims to Jerusalem. The settlement of 1192 preserved a Latin foothold in the Levant, but it also demonstrated the limitations of crusading: monarchs had domestic priorities, provisioning and cohesion were difficult across long distances, and the ideological aim of retaking the Holy City could be compromised by pragmatic deals. Teaching this episode is most effective when it treats Richard and Saladin as complementary actors whose duel of force and diplomacy produced a negotiated outcome rather than a simple victor and vanquished narrative.

## The decline of the crusading ideal up to 1204
By the early thirteenth century the crusading movement had already begun to lose some of its early vigour. Strategic exhaustion, competing priorities in Europe, and the corruption and factionalism that dogged some crusading efforts eroded popular support. Economic interests and the agendas of maritime republics increasingly shaped expeditions. The turn of the crusading movement into the Fourth Crusade and its diversion to Constantinople in 1204 marks a crucial point: instead of proceeding to the Holy Land, crusading energies were redirected by Venetian commercial interests and by the tangled politics of Byzantine succession, culminating in the sack of Constantinople. That event profoundly damaged papal credibility and the original spiritual framing of crusade; it accentuated perceptions that crusading could be exploited for temporal gain and internecine rivalry. Nevertheless, the crusading idea did not disappear — it evolved and persisted — but up to 1204 the image of crusade as a unified, sanctified enterprise had been significantly undermined by division, misdirection and the growing reality that local and mercantile interests could override stated religious aims.

## Exam technique
When approaching standard Higher-style questions on the Crusades, students should aim to combine a clear line of argument with specific factual detail and balanced evaluation. For essay questions that ask "How important…" or "To what extent…", begin with a brief introduction that defines the issue and states your tentative judgement. Develop each paragraph around a distinct factor, explaining it fully and supporting it with specific examples — for instance, name leaders (Urban II, Alexios I, Godfrey, Saladin, Richard I), battles (Manzikert, Hattin), sieges (Antioch, Jerusalem, Acre) and political developments (establishment of the Crusader states, Saladin’s unification, the diversion of the Fourth Crusade). After explaining each factor, evaluate its significance: compare its weight with other factors and consider short-term versus long-term effects. Keep returning to the question so each paragraph contributes to your overall judgement. For questions that require interpretation of causes or motives, separate religious rhetoric from secular incentives and show how both interacted. If a question asks you to assess reasons for success or failure, blend military explanation with political context and logistical constraints. Time management is essential: allow a few minutes to plan, allocate time proportionately to marks available, and leave a short period at the end to rewrite your conclusion so it mirrors the argument you have built. In longer answers clarity of expression, chronological sense and precise examples usually win marks; in source-based or comparative questions be ready to place evidence in context, assess origin and purpose if required, and use recall to evaluate omissions. Always conclude by giving a clear judgement that synthesises the evidence you have discussed.
