# USA 1850–65: 'A House Divided' and the Civil War (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview and key themes
The period 1850–65 in the United States is commonly summarised as the story of a nation coming apart at its seams and then being remade by war. Central themes are sectional conflict and identity, the authority of the federal government versus States’ rights, the moral, economic and political role of enslavement, and the limits of compromise. By 1850 the United States was an expanding continental power with growing industrial capacity in the North, an agricultural, slave-based economy in the South, and new territories whose status threatened to upset an already fragile political balance. The phrase "a house divided", used by Abraham Lincoln in 1858, captures the way slavery became the organising principle of national politics; if it remained unresolved, the Union itself seemed unsustainable. The coming of the Civil War was the product of long-term developments and a series of political crises in the 1850s that made peaceful settlement increasingly unlikely.

## American society and the place of enslavement in 1850
On the eve of the 1850s the United States displayed deep regional contrasts alongside important commonalities. The North had a growing urban and industrial economy, expanding transport networks and diversified labour; the South remained overwhelmingly rural with an economy tied to cotton and other staple crops dependent on enslaved labour. Social and cultural differences — religion, educational structures, patterns of migration — sharpened the sectional identity of each region, but arguments over the expansion and morality of enslavement were the chief driver of political conflict. Enslavement was not simply an economic system: it shaped Southern social hierarchies, politics and ideology. Southern defenders articulated a range of arguments in its favour, from paternalism to economic necessity and racial theories; abolitionists in the North ranged from moderate critics advocating gradual emancipation to radical activists prepared to use direct action. Northern opposition to slavery grew in intensity during the 1850s, and its spread into political life helped to reshape national parties and electoral alignments.

## The crisis of territorial expansion: 1850–57
Territorial expansion after the Mexican War intensified conflict because new territories provoked the crucial question: would they enter the Union as free or slave states? The Compromise of 1850 sought to manage this by admitting California as a free state, organising territories with popular sovereignty in mind, and strengthening the Fugitive Slave Act. That package temporarily stemmed the crisis but created new tensions. The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, which introduced popular sovereignty to determine the status of slavery in new territories and repealed the Missouri Compromise line, produced violent conflict in Kansas and shattered existing party structures. "Bleeding Kansas" became a symbol of the failure of popular sovereignty and of the ferocity of sectional competition on the ground. The 1857 Dred Scott decision by the Supreme Court, which declared that Congress could not prohibit slavery in territories and that African Americans lacked standing as citizens, further inflamed Northern opinion and convinced many that the courts and national politics were captured by pro-slavery interests. These events helped create the "slave power" narrative in the North — the belief that Southern slaveholders dominated federal institutions to the detriment of free labour and republican liberty.

## Political realignment, the Lincoln–Douglas debates and the election of 1860
The 1850s saw the collapse of the Second Party System. The Whig Party disintegrated under the pressure of sectional conflict; the Know-Nothing movement briefly rose and fell; and the Republican Party emerged as a sectional party united in opposition to the expansion of slavery. The Democrats split along sectional lines. In this environment the 1858 Lincoln–Douglas debates in Illinois crystallised competing visions for the nation. Stephen A. Douglas defended popular sovereignty and national party compromise; Abraham Lincoln argued that slavery could not permanently co-exist with free labour in the territories and that the country could not endure half slave and half free. Lincoln’s "house divided" line was rhetorical and diagnostic rather than a precise policy programme, but it made him a national figure. The election of 1860 reflected the fractures: the Democratic vote split between Northern and Southern candidates, allowing Lincoln to win a plurality in the Electoral College without carrying a single Southern state. Southern elites regarded Lincoln's victory as intolerable, believing it threatened the future of slavery, and moved rapidly to secession.

## Secession, the Confederacy and the outbreak of war
Secession in late 1860 and early 1861 was the immediate political response of a majority of Southern slaveholding states. South Carolina led the way, followed by other Deep South states, which then formed the Confederate States of America under Jefferson Davis and adopted a constitution that protected slavery and state sovereignty. The crisis over federal property and authority reached a flashpoint at Fort Sumter in April 1861, where Confederate forces fired on the Union garrison and the first shots of the Civil War were fired. Lincoln’s decision to call for volunteers to suppress the rebellion turned a sectional conflict into a full-scale war. The border states — Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri — were of critical importance because their allegiance could tip strategic balance; Lincoln’s wartime policy carefully combined firmness about preserving the Union with sensitivity to slavery in those states.

## The Civil War as military and social contest, 1861–64
The Civil War was conducted on a scale unprecedented in American history. It combined Napoleonic manoeuvre with industrial-era firepower: massed conscription, rail logistics, rifled artillery and the telegraph changed how campaigns were fought. Union advantages lay in greater population, industrial capacity and a larger railway network; Confederate advantages came from shorter interior lines, military talent among officers, and initial strategic initiative. The Union turned its strengths into strategy under leaders such as Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman, who increasingly adopted total-war methods aimed at destroying Confederate military capability and the economic base that supported it. Major campaigns in the eastern theatre (e.g. Antietam, Gettysburg) and decisive operations in the western theatre (notably Grant’s Vicksburg campaign) together shifted momentum to the North. Soldiers’ experience varied but was uniformly harsh: disease, supply shortages, and the psychological strain of modern warfare were common. The war also transformed social relations: women on both sides took on new roles in industry, nursing and civil administration, and the home fronts were pressured by inflation, conscription controversies, and political dissent.

## Emancipation, African American participation and international dimensions
Lincoln’s evolving policy on emancipation reflects both moral developments and pragmatic wartime calculation. Initially focused on preserving the Union, Lincoln moved toward emancipation as a war aim when it became clear that weakening the slave economy would both hurt the Confederacy and make foreign recognition of the Confederacy harder. The Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation after Antietam and the final Proclamation of January 1863 declared enslaved people in rebelling states to be forever free; it did not immediately free all enslaved people but it transformed the war’s purpose, authorised the recruitment of African American troops, and discouraged British and French intervention. African American soldiers and sailors, including the celebrated 54th Massachusetts, made a significant contribution to Union manpower and symbolic moral force. The Proclamation also set the stage for constitutional change: the Thirteenth Amendment, passed in 1865, abolished enslavement altogether. International diplomacy mattered: the Union’s position benefited from British and French reluctance to support a slaveholding Confederacy, the geopolitics of cotton and industry, and effective Union blockade and propaganda policy.

## Outcomes, consequences and reasons for Union victory
By 1865 the Union had achieved victory and the Confederate states were militarily and economically exhausted. Reasons for Northern victory combine material, military and political factors. Economically, the North’s industrial base, superior finance, and rail network sustained a long war of attrition. Militarily, Union command adapted; coordination between theatres and the eventual rise of commanding generals capable of strategic objectives (Grant and Sherman) were decisive. Politically, Lincoln’s leadership — combining legal and rhetorical skill, patience with generals, and the ability to hold the Republican coalition together — proved crucial. In contrast, the Confederacy suffered from limited resources, problems of centralised authority in a polity that prized states’ rights, and diplomatic isolation. Socially and politically, the war abolished enslavement and remade federal-state relations, at least temporarily. The immediate post-war period posed profound questions about Reconstruction, the integration of freed people into American citizenship, and the balance of power in the reunited nation; these questions would dominate the next decades.

## Exam technique
When preparing for the SQA Advanced Higher question paper on this section, remember the paper’s structure and what examiners expect. You will choose the USA section and be asked to answer two 25-mark extended-response questions in Part A and three source-based questions in Part B (a 12-mark usefulness question, a 12-mark contextualisation question, and a 16-mark two-source interpretations question). Time management across three hours is critical: allow roughly 45–50 minutes for each 25-mark essay, leaving time for planning and review, and about 25–30 minutes in total for the three source questions. In essays, begin with a concise introduction that sets out an argument and a clear plan. Use short, focused paragraphs that link specific evidence to your argument, and integrate historiography to show awareness of differing interpretations. At Advanced Higher level, some explicit engagement with historians’ debates is required: essays without any reference to historiography cannot progress beyond mid-range marks. Historiography does not mean memorising quotes; it means situating your argument within competing views — for example, comparing intentionalist readings of Lincoln’s motives with structural interpretations that stress economic or political pressures.

For source questions, always attend to provenance: who produced the source, when and why, and for whom was it intended. For the usefulness question, assess how well the source answers the specific enquiry, considering content, perspective and limitations, and support this with contextual recall. For the “How fully…?” task, extract the source’s main claims and then use wider knowledge to show what it omits or underplays. For the two-source question, identify the central viewpoints of each source, analyse differences and similarities, and evaluate each source’s value and limitations with reference to provenance and relevant recall. Remember that quality of contextual knowledge matters more than quantity: targeted, relevant detail that supports judgement is far more persuasive than long narrative digressions.

In planning essays, consider cause and consequence carefully: distinguish long-term structural causes (economic and ideological differences), mid-term political triggers (Kansas–Nebraska, Dred Scott, the collapse of parties), and immediate catalysts (election of 1860, Fort Sumter). Use specific examples to illustrate general points: Bleeding Kansas to show failed popular sovereignty, Dred Scott to show constitutional crisis, Antietam and the Emancipation Proclamation to link military events with policy change. Conclude by weighing competing factors, making a balanced judgement that addresses the question directly. Practise past paper questions under timed conditions, annotate model essays to see how evidence, analysis and historiography are integrated, and rehearse source work by focusing on provenance plus precise contextual recall. Above all, aim for clarity of argument, precise use of evidence, and consistent reference to the question throughout each answer.
