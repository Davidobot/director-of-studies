# Germany 1918–39: Weimar to Nazi dictatorship (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction and key themes
The period 1918–39 in Germany traces the collapse of imperial Germany, the fragile experiment of the Weimar Republic, and the dramatic transformation into the Nazi dictatorship. Students should approach this era as a series of linked political, social and economic developments in which short-term crises interacted with long-term structural weaknesses. Themes to bear in mind include the contested nature of authority in a fragmented political culture, the impact of economic shocks on political behaviour, the role of violence and extra‑legal actors in politics, and the interaction between ideology and state-building under National Socialism. Understanding how elites, parties, mass voters, and institutions like the presidency and the courts behaved is as important as knowing the headline events.

## Revolution, civil war and the birth of Weimar, 1918–23
Germany’s transition from imperial rule began with military defeat and the November Revolution of 1918. The abdication of the Kaiser and the creation of a republic were the result of a mixture of popular unrest and elite decisions. The Social Democratic leader Friedrich Ebert concluded a pact with the military leadership (the Ebert–Groener agreement) which secured the army’s cooperation but also tied the new republic to conservative institutions. Revolutionary energy from below produced the short-lived Soviet councils in cities and the Spartacist uprising in January 1919, which was violently suppressed by government-aligned Freikorps units, leaving a legacy of bitterness on the left.

The new constitution created in Weimar established liberal democratic structures, but proportional representation and a powerful president with emergency powers left the system vulnerable to fragmentation and executive rule by decree. The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 added to political trauma: territorial losses, military restrictions, reparations and the “war guilt” clause were widely perceived as humiliating and fuelled nationalist resentment which politicians on the right exploited. Economic crises between 1919 and 1923, culminating in the occupation of the Ruhr and hyperinflation, had devastating social effects and undermined faith in democratic government. Hyperinflation destroyed savings, hit the middle classes hard and produced a mood in which radical solutions gained appeal.

## The Stresemann era and the “Golden Years”, 1924–29
From late 1923 a degree of stability returned. Currency reform with the Rentenmark and negotiated solutions to reparations, including the Dawes Plan, helped stabilise the economy. Gustav Stresemann, serving as Chancellor briefly and then as Foreign Minister, steered policies that sought to normalise Germany’s international position while working within the constitutional limits of Weimar politics. His foreign policy of fulfilment (“Erfüllungspolitik”) led to the Locarno Treaties and membership in the League of Nations, which reassured many Germans and improved diplomatic standing.

Domestically, the mid-1920s saw improvements in living standards for some, an expansion of welfare provision and cultural experimentation; yet these years were also a period of underlying fragility. The improvements depended on foreign capital and short-term loans, the party system remained divided, and resentments over Versailles persisted. Political violence continued on the margins, and traditional elites in the judiciary, the civil service and the military retained conservative, often anti‑republican sympathies. Historians debate whether the recovery was real or a precarious illusion, but for students the key point is that Weimar’s stability was conditional and could not insulate Germany from future external shocks.

## Collapse of the Republic and the rise of Nazism, 1929–33
The Wall Street Crash of 1929 transformed Germany’s political landscape. The influx of American loans dried up, industrial production contracted and unemployment soared. The economic emergency eroded support for moderate parties and discredited coalition democracy. The chancellorship of Heinrich Brüning, which relied increasingly on Article 48 emergency powers, pursued austerity measures that deepened the slump and alienated voters. Parliamentary governments gave way to a succession of presidential cabinets in which elites sought to manage democracy by decree.

Against this backdrop, the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP) made dramatic electoral gains. The Nazis combined a populist rejection of the Treaty of Versailles, a radical anti‑communism, appeals to the middle and lower middle classes, and effective propaganda and organisation. Between 1928 and 1932 their share of the vote rose from a marginal presence to the largest party in the Reichstag in July 1932. Yet electoral volatility continued: the Nazis’ vote fell again in November 1932 and they did not initially command a majority. The path to power culminated not in a straightforward Nazi electoral victory but through elite manoeuvring. Conservative politicians, industrialists and von Papen believed they could control Hitler and use him to restore order. On 30 January 1933 President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor as part of a deal that underestimated his capacity to seize control.

## Seizure and consolidation of power, 1933–34
The Nazi takeover combined legal measures, violence, and political manipulation. The Reichstag Fire in February 1933 provided the pretext for the Reichstag Fire Decree which suspended civil liberties and allowed arrest of political opponents. The March 1933 Enabling Act, passed under intimidation and with the Social Democrats excluded, gave Hitler’s cabinet the power to legislate without parliamentary consent and effectively dismantled parliamentary democracy. The Gleichschaltung process institutionalised Nazi control: Länder governments, professional associations, trade unions and cultural organisations were brought into line and non‑Nazi parties were banned. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service removed “non-Aryans” and political opponents from the bureaucracy.

Terror was a persistent tool. The SA’s prominence and its radicalism alarmed conservative elites and the army; in late June–July 1934 the “Night of the Long Knives” saw SA leadership purged and many opponents murdered, consolidating Hitler’s control and securing the loyalty of the army. The death of President Hindenburg in August 1934 allowed Hitler to merge the offices of Chancellor and President, and the army swore an oath of personal loyalty to him. By mid‑1934 the legal and extra‑legal framework of the dictatorship was in place.

## The Nazi state and society, 1933–39
The Nazi regime was marked by a blend of charismatic leadership, party activism, institutional pluralism and terror. Propaganda, orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels, cultivated the “Hitler myth”, presenting the Führer as Germany’s saviour. At the same time, the governance of the Third Reich was polycratic and competitive: ministries, party organisations and Nazi agencies vied for resources and influence, producing a chaotic administrative landscape in which radicalisation often resulted from agencies competing to implement Hitler’s goals.

A central aim was to create a Volksgemeinschaft, an idealised national community unified by race and loyalty to the regime. Racial ideology drove policies that increasingly marginalised and persecuted Jews and other “outsiders.” From the boycott of Jewish businesses in 1933 through to the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 which stripped Jews of citizenship and forbade mixed marriage, anti‑Jewish measures became increasingly systematic. The state encouraged conformity through youth organisations, women’s policies that emphasised motherhood and family (Kinder, Küche, Kirche rhetoric), and repression of independent trade unions and political dissent.

## Economy, rearmament and foreign policy, 1933–39
Economic policy under the Nazis combined work-creation measures, state intervention and eventual prioritisation of military preparedness. Hjalmar Schacht, as President of the Reichsbank and briefly as minister, stabilised finance and introduced credit instruments and public works that reduced unemployment. Schacht’s “New Plan” sought to control imports and manage foreign exchange, using measures like Mefo bills to finance rearmament off the official budget. From 1936 Göring’s Four Year Plan signalled a shift to more direct planning for autarky and rapid rearmament; its emphasis on synthetic substitutes, state controls and prioritised allocations restructured the economy for war, even if full autarky remained elusive.

Foreign policy pursued by Hitler exploited the weaknesses of the Versailles settlement and the pacifist mood of Britain and France. Rearmament was conducted incrementally, culminating in dramatic steps that tested the post‑war order: remilitarisation of the Rhineland (1936), the Anschluss with Austria (1938), and the Munich agreement (1938) which ceded the Sudetenland. These moves boosted regime popularity and fed into the Hitler myth by presenting Germany as finally overturning humiliation. By the eve of war, German foreign policy combined opportunism, long-term revisionist aims and a calculated exploitation of Western appeasement.

## Opposition, resistance and the limits of dissent, 1933–39
Assessing opposition to the regime requires nuance. There were multiple strands of non‑conformity: church opposition, socialists and communists forced underground, conservative elites who were sidelined, and small-scale cultural and youth resistance. The Confessing Church challenged regime interference in Protestant churches and figures such as Martin Niemöller became voices of dissent. Working‑class resistance was fragmented after trade unions were crushed, and many potential opponents emigrated or were arrested. Small groups and clandestine networks continued to protest or aid victims, but the scale of organised, effective resistance before 1939 was limited. Reasons include the effectiveness of repression by the Gestapo and the SS, the regime’s success in restoring employment and national pride, and the erosion of institutional bases for opposition. Historiographical debates have explored the balance between coercion and consent in sustaining Nazi rule; students should recognise that both features worked together to produce limited resistance.

## Historiography and interpretations
Understanding this period benefits from engagement with competing historical interpretations. Older “Sonderweg” explanations emphasised a German special path and structural continuity from authoritarian Prussia to Nazism. Intentionalist historians stress Hitler’s centrality and ideological planning, while structuralists argue that bureaucratic competition, social pressures and institutional dynamics produced radical outcomes irrespective of a pre-defined plan. Debates also surround the extent to which Weimar was “doomed” versus salvageable, the relative weight of economic crisis versus political culture in the Nazi rise, and the motives of conservative elites who facilitated Hitler. For exam answers, it is useful to present a clear argument that engages with these debates: historians’ views should inform but not replace the use of primary evidence and your own analysis.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on Germany 1918–39 requires careful planning, clear argumentation and precise use of evidence. For essay questions, begin by defining the terms of the question and setting out a concise, evaluative thesis that answers it directly. Organise the essay thematically and chronologically where appropriate, ensuring each paragraph develops a point that relates back to the central argument. Use specific examples—dates, legislation, events and individuals—to support claims: reference the Reichstag Fire Decree, the Enabling Act, the Night of the Long Knives, the Nuremberg Laws, the Dawes Plan, and key figures such as Ebert, Stresemann, Brüning, Hindenburg and Hitler. Integrate historiography by explaining how different historians interpret events and then use your own evidence to support, modify or challenge those interpretations; superficial name‑dropping of historians without application gains little credit.

When tackling source questions, focus on provenance, content and context. For “evaluate the usefulness” tasks, assess who produced the source, when and why, then link those features to strengths and limitations for the question at hand. For contextualisation questions, summarise the source’s view and expand with relevant background facts and historiographical context to show what the source leaves out or implies. For two‑source comparisons, identify the main arguments of each source, assess each in turn with reference to provenance and corroboration, and then explain similarities and differences in light of wider evidence. Always avoid generalised statements about “bias”; instead, be specific about how the author’s position, intended audience or timing affects the reliability or perspective of the source.

Manage your time in the exam. With three hours for the paper, allocate time to plan and draft answers, leaving a short period for review. Ensure your essays include a clear introduction and a developed conclusion that weighs evidence and addresses the question’s terms. Write legibly and reference key dates and statutes accurately. Finally, practise writing concise, argued essays under timed conditions and work through past source papers so that provenance, contextualisation and interpretation become second nature. This methodical approach will help you demonstrate both factual knowledge and the analytical skills valued at Advanced Higher level.
