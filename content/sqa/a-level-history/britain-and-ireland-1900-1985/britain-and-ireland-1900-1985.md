# Britain and Ireland: identity, conflict and partition, 1900–1985 (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: themes and chronology
The history of Britain and Ireland between 1900 and 1985 is shaped by competing national identities, disputes over authority, and repeated attempts — violent and constitutional — to resolve the problem of Irish self-government. From the cultural and political revival of the early twentieth century through the violence of revolution and civil war, and from the long-standing political accommodation of partition to the eruption of mass communal conflict in the late 1960s, this period asks questions about nationhood, the limits of political compromise, and the legacies of state-building. For study and revision it is helpful to follow three broad arcs: the rise of nationalist and unionist mobilisation to 1921; the divergence of political development in the Irish Free State/Republic and Northern Ireland; and the resurgence of conflict from 1968 to the mid-1980s that exposed the weaknesses of partition and the limits of both force and diplomacy.

## Growing tension in Ireland to 1914
Tension in Ireland before 1914 had deep cultural, economic and political roots. The Irish Cultural Revival — expressed through organisations like the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association — helped to restore a public sense of a distinct Irish identity that was cultural as well as political. Politically the Home Rule movement, led in the Commons by John Redmond’s Irish Parliamentary Party, pressed for devolved government for Ireland; it made significant progress legislatively in the early 1900s but met fierce opposition from militant unionism in Ulster. Unionist mobilisation, epitomised by Edward Carson and the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force, and the mass signing of the Ulster Covenant in 1912, demonstrated that many Protestants in the north regarded constitutional union with Britain as essential to identity and security. The Home Rule Bills of this era revealed not simply a constitutional dispute but an anxiety about competing national futures: for many nationalists self-government was a restoration of rights; for many unionists it was an existential threat. Events such as the Larne gun-running (1914), the formation of the Irish Volunteers, and political brinkmanship in London and Dublin made the constitutional settlement precarious by the outbreak of the First World War.

## World War I, 1916 and the revolutionary decade
World War I intensified divisions. John Redmond’s encouragement of Irish volunteers to support the British war effort won some approval but also alienated those who favoured a more separatist path. The 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin — a relatively small insurrection that the British suppressed forcefully — became a pivotal moment because the execution of its leaders transformed public sympathy and shifted opinion towards republicanism. The 1918 conscription crisis, when Britain considered extending conscription to Ireland, further united wide parts of Irish opinion in resistance and contributed to the collapse of the Irish Parliamentary Party at the 1918 general election. Sinn Féin’s landslide victory, its abstentionism in Westminster and the establishment of the Dáil Éireann (the revolutionary parliament) in 1919 inaugurated the Anglo-Irish War (or War of Independence). The conflict combined guerrilla actions carried out by the Irish Republican Army with harsh reprisals by British forces, including the Black and Tans and the Auxiliaries, and policing that fuelled nationalist grievances. By 1921 both sides were exhausted and diplomatic channels opened.

## Anglo‑Irish Treaty, partition and the Civil War
The negotiations that led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 resolved some questions but left others open. The Treaty established the Irish Free State as a self-governing Dominion within the British Commonwealth while allowing Northern Ireland — the six northeastern counties with a Protestant-Unionist majority — to opt out and remain part of the United Kingdom. It also contained an oath of allegiance to the Crown and provisions for boundary commissions and naval bases, measures that satisfied some and infuriated others. Supporters such as Michael Collins argued that the Treaty provided a practical foundation for building long-term independence; opponents such as Éamon de Valera saw it as a betrayal of republican ideals of full sovereignty. The split in the republican movement over acceptance of the Treaty led almost immediately to the Irish Civil War (1922–23), a bitter conflict of former comrades that deepened political divides and shaped the politics of the emerging Irish state for decades. The consequences for identity were profound: partition became embedded not only in maps and institutions but in political memory and attitudes on both sides.

## Northern Ireland and long-term Unionist dominance, 1921–1968
In Northern Ireland, the new Stormont parliament and government (dominated by the Ulster Unionist Party) established a political order that emphasised unionist identity and the security of the Protestant community. Unionist control of local government, electoral boundaries and public employment produced long-term effects: many nationalists and Catholics experienced discrimination in housing, jobs and voting through practices such as gerrymandering and biased allocation of public resources. Economically the region had industrial strengths in shipbuilding and heavy industry but also social and regional inequalities that shaped political loyalties. For many decades, unionist governance claimed stability and security as its achievement, but the structural exclusion of Catholics from full citizenship in Northern Ireland produced simmering grievances. Small-scale campaigns and occasional IRA activity punctuated inter-war and post-war Northern Ireland, but mass mobilisation did not erupt until the late 1960s when civil rights demands met entrenched resistance.

## From civil rights to the Troubles, 1968–1985
The civil rights movement that emerged in Northern Ireland in 1968 sought to end discrimination in housing, voting and policing, and to secure equal treatment for Catholics. Inspired in part by global currents of protest and rights-based rhetoric, civil rights marches exposed the scale of institutional grievance when marches were blocked and sometimes violently attacked. Loyalist reactions and clashes with the police created an escalation that culminated in the deployment of the British Army in 1969. The split in republicanism led to the formation of the Provisional IRA, which embarked on a prolonged armed campaign against the state, while loyalist paramilitary groups such as the UVF and UDA engaged in sectarian violence and intimidation. Governmental responses ranged from internment without trial in 1971 to the controversial events of Bloody Sunday in 1972, when British soldiers shot civilians in Derry during a march, deepening alienation and recruitment into republican ranks. The suspension of Stormont and the introduction of direct rule from Westminster in 1972 attempted to impose stability but did not end violence. Attempts at political accommodation, most notably the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973 with its short-lived power-sharing executive and a cross-border Council of Ireland, collapsed under unionist opposition and the Ulster Workers’ Council strike. The hunger strikes of 1981, with the death of Bobby Sands and others, internationalised the conflict again and gave electoral impetus to Sinn Féin. The Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 marked a diplomatic shift by giving the Republic of Ireland a consultative role in Northern Irish affairs; it met fierce unionist protest but also indicated that durable resolution required both political negotiation and recognition of cross-border realities.

## Interpreting causes and consequences: identity, authority and contestation
Throughout 1900–1985 the interplay of religion, class, ethnicity and memory framed political choices. Nationalist assertions of Irish identity, whether cultural or republican, confronted unionist attachments to Britishness and fears of marginalisation. Authority in the form of policing, state institutions and constitutional arrangements often produced resistance when perceived as partial. The choice between political and violent strategies did not fall neatly along simple lines: there were constitutional nationalists, militant republicans, moderate unionists, and militant loyalists, and their interactions shifted over time. Partition resolved immediate political conflict for some, but it also institutionalised community division and left unresolved questions about citizenship and justice that returned with force in the late twentieth century. Teaching this topic profitably combines political narrative with social and cultural evidence: newspapers, election results, oral testimony, government reports, and propaganda all illuminate how people understood their identity and why they acted as they did.

## Exam technique
When answering SQA-style questions on Britain and Ireland, begin by identifying exactly what the question asks: is it asking you to evaluate reasons, assess impact, explain causes, or analyse sources? For essay-style questions, open with a concise thesis that signposts a line of argument. Structure the main body around clear analytical paragraphs that each address a distinct factor or consequence; develop each point with specific evidence (names, dates, events) and explain how it supports your judgement. Do not simply narrate; always link evidence back to the question and weigh competing factors before reaching a balanced conclusion that makes a judgement of relative importance.

For the Scottish/Source-style questions you will meet in the SQA papers, work systematically with provenance: identify the origin, purpose and content of the source and then assess its usefulness or explanatory power for the question posed. When asked “How fully…?” judge the extent of the source’s explanation and fill in omissions with recalled knowledge. For two-source comparison questions, identify the main interpretations each source presents, note agreements and differences, and use contextual knowledge to corroborate or challenge those interpretations. Always quote or refer directly to key lines from sources, but use such quotations to support detailed explanation and to show how they answer the question.

Time management matters. In a 90-minute paper plan quickly: allow time to annotate the question and sketch a brief plan, write with clarity, and leave a few minutes to refine your conclusion. For the assignment component choose a focused question that allows you to marshal evidence and develop argument within the time limit, prepare a concise resource sheet (250 words maximum) that highlights key sources and lines of argument, and practise producing polished prose under timed conditions. Finally, remember that SQA assessment rewards well-reasoned, evidenced argument and clear engagement with both factors and judgements; answering the question directly and consistently is the most reliable route to high marks.
