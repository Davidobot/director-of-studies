# The American Revolution, 1763–1787 (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview and chronological frame
The period 1763–1787 traces the transformation of thirteen British colonies in North America from dependent, semi-autonomous provinces into an independent republic. The end of the Seven Years’ War in 1763 left Britain territorially triumphant but financially strained, and imperial priorities changed. What had been decades of increasing economic and political divergence — shaped by differing political cultures, economic interests and local institutions — became acute confrontation over authority and rights. The conflict moved from constitutional argument and economic protest in the 1760s and early 1770s to military war from 1775, political declaration of independence in 1776, and finally diplomatic settlement and experimentation with new political institutions culminating in the Constitution of 1787. Understanding the Revolution requires attention to the long-term causes, the immediate crises, the military course of the war, the international dimension, and the revolutionary settlement’s consequences for the United States and for Britain.

## Why resentment had grown by 1763
Colonial resentment by 1763 had roots both in the imperial system and in the colonies’ own political development. For much of the 18th century Britain practised a degree of “salutary neglect”: colonial assemblies exercised substantial control over taxation and internal affairs, and local elites expected a wide scope of self-government. The end of the French and Indian War changed that balance. Britain’s huge war debt and the perceived need to station garrisons in North America prompted ministers to seek new revenue from the empire. Measures intended to tighten imperial control — including the Navigation Acts’ enforcement, the Sugar Act (1764), and later the Stamp Act (1765) — collided with colonial assumptions about rights, representation and taxation. Colonists argued that only their own assemblies could levy internal taxes; “no taxation without representation” encapsulated the constitutional language of many opponents. Economic grievances combined with cultural and political ones: colonial assemblies and courts had become important centres of local prestige, and many colonists increasingly saw British policies as an infringement on their liberties. Events such as the Boston Massacre (1770) and punitive responses to protest, including the Intolerable (Coercive) Acts of 1774, confirmed for many colonists that London was prepared to coerce rather than to accommodate colonial concerns.

## From protest to independence: ideas, leaders and turning points
The movement towards independence was not instantaneous or inevitable; it unfolded through contested debates about rights, prerogative and the empire. Early resistance often took familiar constitutional forms: petitions, legal argument, boycotts of British goods, and coordinated action through colonial assemblies and intercolonial bodies. Intellectual currents also mattered. Enlightenment ideas about natural rights, mixed with practical experience of colonial self-government, fed popular and elite arguments for more radical change. Thomas Paine’s Common Sense (1776) is the most famous example of persuasive republican rhetoric, but the shift also reflected material pressures, such as the British military presence and the closing of political avenues for redress after hostilities began. Key figures shaped the course: George Washington provided military leadership and symbolic unity; colonial statesmen in the Continental Congress — including John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson — combined constitutional argument with diplomatic initiative. The Declaration of Independence on 4 July 1776 was both a statement of principles and a political break that consolidated support in many colonies while alienating Loyalists. The internal picture was complex: not all colonists supported independence, and sizeable Loyalist minorities, along with many Native American nations and enslaved people, complicated the revolutionary crisis.

## The military course and phases of the war
Fighting opened in 1775 at Lexington and Concord and rapidly expanded into a continental conflict. The military story has distinct phases. The early years featured New England campaigns and the attempt by British commanders to crush the rebellion quickly, including the costly frontal assaults at Bunker Hill. After setbacks and the evacuation of Boston, British strategy shifted to the middle colonies and, later, to the southern colonies where they hoped to rally Loyalist support. The turning point was Saratoga in 1777, where an American victory convinced France that the colonists could be a viable ally. The winter at Valley Forge (1777–78) tested the Continental Army but also saw its professionalisation under leaders such as Baron von Steuben. From 1778 the war became global: French naval and military support changed the strategic balance, complicating British operations. The southern theatre saw a protracted guerrilla-style conflict and significant battles such as Kings Mountain and Cowpens; the culmination came at Yorktown in 1781, where combined American and French forces forced the surrender of Cornwallis. Although fighting continued in some regions, Yorktown effectively ended major British hopes of victory, and diplomatic negotiations led to the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

## The global nature of the conflict
The American Revolution cannot be seen in isolation. From 1778 Britain faced a coalition that included France, Spain and eventually the Dutch, turning a colonial rebellion into a global war for imperial advantage. French intervention was decisive: it provided naval power, money, troops and supplies, and its entry forced Britain to divert resources across the Atlantic and into European waters. Spain’s operations, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and Dutch commercial involvement widened the conflict’s scope. The League of Armed Neutrality and interventions by other powers complicated British sea power and trade. For Britain the war intersected with wider imperial concerns; maintaining global imperial commitments strained finance and public support. Diplomatically, American emissaries such as Benjamin Franklin played a crucial role in securing favourable terms from France and, later, negotiating directly with Britain. The international context therefore magnified the colonists’ strategic advantages and turned what might have been a localized rebellion into a contest of empires.

## Why the colonists won
The reasons for American victory were multiple and interlocking. British strategic and logistical problems were significant: fighting a transatlantic war imposed long supply lines, costly reinforcements and command challenges. British commanders also misjudged colonial society, underestimating the levels of popular resistance and the limits of Loyalist support. American advantages included the depth of local support for the patriot cause in many areas, familiarity with the terrain and flexible militia tactics that wore down British forces. Washington’s role in holding the army together, avoiding catastrophic defeats and maintaining morale was crucial, but so too was the cumulative impact of allied French naval and military aid after 1778. Diplomatic successes — France’s entry, Spanish pressure, and later Dutch complications — forced Britain into a wider war that it found increasingly unprofitable. Economic factors such as war expenses, disruption of trade and political opposition at home also eroded British resolve. Finally, the ideological commitment of many Americans to republican principles and the tangible experience of self-government made continued resistance a meaningful project rather than a transient revolt.

## Political consequences and the making of the United States, 1783–1787
The Revolution’s political outcome was not simply independence; it was a revolution in constitutional ideas and practice. The Treaty of Paris (1783) recognised American independence and opened new commercial possibilities, but it left the new states with the urgent task of political organisation. The immediate post-war settlement under the Articles of Confederation (ratified 1781) created a weak central government, reflecting anti‑monarchical and anti-centralist fears. Problems under the Articles — difficulties in raising revenue, interstate commercial disputes, and limited federal authority — became increasingly evident. Social and economic unrest, illustrated by incidents such as Shays’ Rebellion in 1786–87, exposed the weaknesses of the confederal system and created momentum for constitutional reform. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 produced a new framework that balanced federal power with state sovereignty, introduced a stronger executive, created a bicameral legislature, and established a federal judiciary. It also reflected compromises over slavery and representation, notably the Three-Fifths Compromise, and left many issues unresolved, especially slavery and Native American displacement. The Constitution’s adoption set the institutional foundations for the United States and made the Revolution a constructive, if imperfect, attempt to create a stable republican polity.

## Interpretations, contested issues and teaching pointers
Scholars differ over the Revolution’s causes, character and consequences, and these debates are useful for students to explore. Some interpretations emphasise long-term economic and social transformations that made imperial ties less attractive; others stress constitutional and ideological disputes about rights and sovereignty. Still others foreground imperial fiscal pressures after 1763 as the proximate cause. Assessing British opinion during the war is also nuanced: in Britain views ranged from seeing the colonists as traitors to treating them as victims of misgovernment whose grievances deserved debate, a division evident in Parliamentary debates and pamphlet literature. The role of marginalised groups — enslaved people, Native Americans, women and Loyalists — complicates the story; for enslaved people, the British offered emancipation to some, creating complex loyalties and contributing to an Atlantic dimension of freedom struggles. Teaching the Revolution benefits from moving between the political, military and social dimensions, using primary sources such as the Stamp Act Congress declarations, Paine’s Common Sense, contemporaneous British Parliamentary speeches, and diplomatic correspondence to illustrate different perspectives. Chronology matters: emphasise the shift from constitutional protest to armed conflict and then to institutional consolidation after independence.

## Exam technique
When answering an SQA-style essay on the American Revolution, begin with a concise thesis that directly addresses the question’s stem (for example, “To what extent…”, “How important…”, or a quotation). In the opening paragraph set a clear argument and outline the main factors you will weigh. Structure the body of the answer as a series of analytical paragraphs, each focused on a single factor; begin with a topic sentence that links the factor to the question, follow with specific evidence and examples (dates, legislation, battles, named individuals), then assess its significance and limitations. Balance is essential: give weight to counter‑arguments and explain why one factor may be more or less important in context. Use precise factual recall — such as the Stamp Act (1765), the Boston Tea Party (1773), Saratoga (1777), French intervention (1778), Yorktown (1781), Treaty of Paris (1783), and the Constitutional Convention (1787) — to anchor judgement. Don’t overgeneralise: clarify whether you mean short-term or long-term causes, local or imperial factors, military or diplomatic influences. For source-based or interpretation questions, identify authorship, purpose and audience before using the source points as evidence, and always introduce recalled knowledge to show wider awareness. Manage your time effectively in a 90-minute paper by planning for around 40–45 minutes per extended essay, leaving time to proofread and tighten your conclusion. Finally, end with a succinct judgement that answers the question in light of the evidence you have discussed, explaining the relative importance of factors rather than merely summarising them.
