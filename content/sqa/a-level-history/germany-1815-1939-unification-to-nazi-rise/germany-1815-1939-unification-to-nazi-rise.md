# Germany 1815–1939: unification to the Nazi era (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview and long-term context
The period 1815–1939 in German history traces the transformation of a fragmented set of states into a powerful, unified empire and then into a nation that experienced revolution, fragile democracy and the radicalisation which brought the Nazis to power. After the Napoleonic Wars the Congress of Vienna restored a loose German Confederation of princes but also stimulated intellectual and cultural movements that fed nationalism. Industrialisation, the expansion of railways and the Zollverein (customs union) knitted economies together even where political unity remained absent. The experience of defeat in 1918, the punitive terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and the economic shocks of the 1920s and 1930s created fertile ground for radical movements. Throughout the century political ideas competed: liberal constitutionalism, conservative monarchical order, socialist demands from an increasingly organised working class, and a growing ideology of ethnic-nationalist exclusion. Understanding the long-term interplay between social change, economic integration and political leadership is crucial for explaining how unification happened and why democracy later failed.

## The growth of nationalism, 1815–1850
Nationalist sentiment in the German lands grew from cultural and political roots. The trauma of Napoleon’s dominance and the Wars of Liberation (1813–14) produced both resentment of foreign domination and an emerging sense of German identity among intellectuals, students and some middle-class groups. Romantic writers, university Burschenschaften (student clubs) and thinkers who emphasised a shared language, law and culture helped popularise the idea of a German nation beyond dynastic loyalty. Economic developments, especially industrialisation in the Rhineland and parts of Prussia, created a communicative infrastructure—newspapers, railways and the Zollverein—that encouraged common interests and a sense that political unity could help economic growth.

Yet this nationalism was varied. For many liberals it meant constitutional government and civil liberties; for conservatives it meant strengthening German power while preserving monarchies; for workers it often meant social and economic reform. The 1830 revolutions and the wave of 1848 across the German states revealed both the appeal and the limits of nationalist politics: mass support existed in cities and among intellectuals, but peasant conservatism, regional loyalties and competing visions of what a German nation should be constrained unity. The Frankfurt Parliament of 1848–49 attempted a parliamentary solution to unification but ultimately failed, demonstrating the gap between nationalist aspiration and political reality.

## Obstacles to unification, 1815–50
Several structural and political obstacles prevented early unification. The German Confederation itself was a loose association of about thirty-nine sovereign states, from tiny principalities to powerful Austria and Prussia. Dynastic interests and the fragmented legal and administrative systems made a single constitutional settlement hard to achieve. Religious divisions—mainly Protestant north versus largely Catholic south—added another layer of difficulty where confessional identity tied populations to regional rulers. Austria’s role as a multi-national empire posed a particular problem: Vienna could not lead a German nation-state without sidelining its other imperial commitments, and many German nationalists did not want an Austria-dominated Germany.

Social factors also stymied unification. Many peasants were indifferent to liberal nationalism, and conservatives feared the social consequences of rapid change. The failure of 1848–49 showed the unwillingness of crucial social groups, including large parts of the rural population and much of the conservative aristocracy, to back a liberal parliamentary project. In short, political fragmentation, dynastic and religious loyalties, and differing socioeconomic interests made the path to unity complex and contested.

## Why unification was achieved by 1871
The unification achieved by 1871 was the product of changing power dynamics, economic integration and the decisive leadership of Prussia under Bismarck. Prussia’s industrial growth, military reforms and the expansion of the railway network strengthened its economic and military position relative to Austria. The Zollverein had already created economic interdependence that favoured Prussia and encouraged the smaller German states to align with the growing Prussian market.

Otto von Bismarck, Prussia’s chancellor from 1862, applied a pragmatic and coercive policy—Realpolitik—that prioritised power over ideology. He engineered a series of conflicts that eliminated rival claims and rallied nationalist sentiment in a way favourable to Prussia. The Danish War of 1864 settled the Schleswig-Holstein question and involved Austria as a co-belligerent, the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 decisively expelled Austrian influence from German affairs after Prussia’s victory at Königgrätz, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 created a national crisis which Bismarck exploited to secure the southern German states’ support. The proclamation of the German Empire at Versailles in January 1871, with the Prussian king crowned as Kaiser, secured political unification under Prussian dominance, but it did so on conservative terms: the new empire combined authoritarian institutions, such as a powerful Kaiser and Chancellor, with federal structures that preserved the princes’ status.

Unification was therefore less a triumph of liberal nationalist ideals than an expression of realpolitik backed by military success and economic integration. Bismarck’s social legislation and later Kulturkampf policies showed that unification also required securing the loyalty of diverse social groups through both reform and repression.

## The German Empire to 1914: consolidation and tensions
Once unified, Germany rapidly became one of Europe’s great powers. Industrial output, scientific innovation and a growing colonial presence fuelled confidence and social change. Politically, the new constitutional arrangements preserved significant authoritarian elements: the Kaiser retained control over foreign policy and the military; the Bundesrat represented state governments; and the Reichstag, though elected, had limited control over the executive. These structures produced a tension between modernising economic forces and conservative political control.

Socially, the rapid urbanisation and growth of the working class created pressure for socialist politics. Bismarck responded with a mixture of repression—the Anti-Socialist Laws—and pioneering social welfare legislation aimed at undercutting socialist appeal. Nationalism and militarism were cultivated in culture and education, setting foundations for the intense nationalism of the early 20th century. By 1914, Germany was powerful but also divided by class tensions, the unresolved status of national minorities, and a ruling elite wary of parliamentary democracy.

## From defeat to dictatorship: Weimar weaknesses and the Nazi rise, 1918–1933
The First World War’s end in 1918 brought revolution and the creation of the Weimar Republic, a fragile democracy burdened by structural weaknesses. The new constitution mixed democratic elements with emergency powers, leaving room for authoritarian interventions. The Treaty of Versailles imposed territorial losses, reparations and the “war guilt” clause; these terms engendered widespread resentment and were exploited by nationalist movements. The Weimar government’s association with defeat and its reliance on emergency measures and coalition politics undermined its legitimacy.

Economic crises exacerbated political instability. Hyperinflation in 1923 devastated savings and fed a narrative of catastrophic failure. The relative stabilisation of the mid-1920s was fragile, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 plunged Germany into mass unemployment and social dislocation. In this context, the Nazis’ message—national humiliation reversed, economic recovery, and the promise of decisive leadership—resonated. Hitler’s skilful use of propaganda, mass rallies, and the party’s paramilitary wing (the SA) combined with the Communist threat to convince many that only authoritarian solutions could restore order.

Crucially, the Nazis did not seize power only by street violence. Electoral gains from 1928 to 1932, combined with backroom politics, brought them into the corridors of power. Conservative elites, including industrialists and large landowners, feared socialism and believed they could control Hitler, seeing him as a useful tool. This fatal miscalculation, together with President Hindenburg’s willingness to appoint Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933, cleared the way for authoritarian takeover.

## How the Nazis stayed in power, 1933–39
Once in office, the Nazis consolidated control through a combination of legal measures, terror, co-option and social policy. The Reichstag Fire in February 1933 gave the regime a pretext to suspend civil liberties and arrest opponents. The Enabling Act of 23 March 1933 legally transferred legislative powers to the cabinet, effectively allowing Hitler to govern by decree and bypass parliamentary checks. Political parties were banned or dissolved; trade unions were smashed and replaced by the German Labour Front; and the process of Gleichschaltung brought federal states, the press, cultural institutions and education into alignment with Nazi goals.

Violence and intimidation remained central. The Gestapo, SS and a network of informers suppressed dissent, while the Night of the Long Knives in June 1934 eliminated internal threats and reassured conservative elites by ridding the movement of radical SA leaders. After President Hindenburg’s death in August 1934 the offices of president and chancellor were merged and Hitler secured the army’s loyalty, cementing his personal control.

The regime also sought popular support through economic and social measures. Public works programmes, such as the Autobahn, rearmament and reduced unemployment, together with welfare initiatives for “Aryan” families and a pervasive propaganda campaign, created the appearance of recovery and national revival. Foreign policy successes—reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936 and the Anschluss with Austria in 1938—boosted prestige and approval. By 1939 the combination of repression, institutional control, economic improvement for many and the cult of the Führer made effective opposition nearly impossible.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on Germany 1815–1939 requires a clear balance of factual recall, analysis of causes and effects, and evaluation of competing explanations. Begin essays by defining key terms and setting a chronological frame to show you understand the question’s scope. For “how important” or “to what extent” questions, organise your response around the main factors, devoting a paragraph to each, and always link evidence to your argument: name dates, events and individuals (for example, the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, the 1870 Ems Dispatch, the 1923 hyperinflation, 30 January 1933, the Enabling Act of March 1933). Use specific examples to illustrate general claims and avoid vague assertions.

Weigh causes by explaining mechanisms: don’t simply list factors; show how the Zollverein created economic alignment that made political unity more attractive, or how the Great Depression translated into mass unemployment that the Nazis exploited. Consider counter-arguments and limitations: acknowledge why liberal nationalism failed in 1848, why some Germans continued to support the Weimar system, or why economic recovery under the Nazis did not erase all opposition. For source-based and comparison questions, place sources in their context, assess origin and purpose, and combine source evidence with recalled knowledge to evaluate usefulness or differing interpretations.

Conclude explicitly. A strong conclusion returns to the question, summarises the weight of evidence and offers a reasoned judgement that recognises complexity rather than presenting a simplistic answer. Practice planning essays under timed conditions, memorise key dates and case studies, and practise linking macro-structures (economy, international affairs, ideology) to individual agency (Bismarck, Hitler) so your answers are both detailed and analytical.
