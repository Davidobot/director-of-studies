# Evaluating historical sources (Advanced Higher) (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## What this topic tests and why it matters
At Advanced Higher level, evaluating historical sources is not just about spotting bias or naming an author; it is about thinking like a historian. You are expected to interrogate evidence, place it within its historical moment, and relate it to wider debates among historians. Assessment demands that you can analyse provenance, interpret content, situate a source in both its historical and historiographical contexts, and use those insights to judge the source’s usefulness for answering a specific question. In the question paper you will apply these skills to unseen sources in three distinct question types and, in the project–dissertation, you will build sustained arguments from wide-ranging primary and secondary material. Success depends on clear analysis, careful use of evidence and a confident awareness of the limits of the material you are using.

## Provenance, purpose and content: unpacking a source
Provenance is the starting point for any useful evaluation. Identifying who produced the source, when they produced it, and why they produced it helps explain what the source can and cannot tell you. An army officer’s report written during a campaign will have different strengths and weaknesses from a memoir published decades later. A newspaper editorial aims to persuade readers and may reflect editorial policy as much as fact, while an official statistic may have been produced to reassure or to impress a superior. After establishing provenance, the next step is to engage carefully with the content. What claims does the source make? Which words and emphases reveal intent? How specific or vague is the evidence provided? Asking these questions helps you move beyond generalisations about bias and towards evidence-based judgements. When interpreting a source, use quotations sparingly and precisely to illuminate a point rather than to fill space.

## Historical and historiographical context
A source only gains full meaning when placed in its historical setting and compared with the interpretations historians have developed about that setting. Historical context includes the immediate events around the source’s creation, such as a campaign, election or policy debate, and the broader structural factors like social, economic or religious change. Historiographical context asks how later scholars have understood the same events. At Advanced Higher you must do more than name historians: you should show how particular interpretations support or challenge the source’s perspective. For example, when analysing a royal proclamation from the fourteenth century, explain how later historians have debated the extent of royal authority at that time and how that debate affects your assessment of the proclamation’s representativeness and purpose. Applied historiography—using historians’ arguments to deepen your analysis—moves your answer from description to critical evaluation.

## Judging reliability and usefulness
Reliability and usefulness are related but distinct judgements. Reliability asks whether the source can be trusted to be accurate or honestly representative of a view at that time. Usefulness asks how valuable the source is for answering a particular historical question. A highly partisan pamphlet may be unreliable as a factual account but extremely useful for understanding the rhetoric and priorities of a political movement. When assessing reliability, consider factors such as the author’s knowledge, intended audience, and possible incentives to distort or omit information. Consider typicality: does the source speak for a broad constituency or for a narrow interest? Cross-checking with other sources strengthens or undermines the claims you make about reliability. When discussing usefulness, be explicit about the specific question the source is being used to answer and explain both what it contributes and what it leaves out. This balanced approach—recognising both strengths and limitations—earns the higher-level marks examiners look for.

## Working with pairs of sources and interpretations
Two-source questions demand that you identify the main argument or view of each source and then evaluate how well each interprets the issue in question. Start by summarising succinctly the viewpoint of each source in your own words, then pick at least three substantial points from each to analyse. For each point explain what the source is claiming, why it might make that claim given its provenance, and how that claim fits within wider historical knowledge or historiographical debate. Avoid simply listing differences; instead, explain why the sources differ. Differences may arise because of the authors’ perspectives, the different moments at which they were written, or because they use different kinds of evidence. A strong response will place the sources in dialogue with each other and with recalled knowledge, indicating which source gives a more convincing account for the specific issue and why, or showing how both add important but different insights.

## Preparing for the project–dissertation and independent research
The project–dissertation is where your source skills are tested in sustained form. Choosing a suitable issue is crucial: your question should invite analysis, evaluation and synthesis rather than simple narrative. Good dissertation topics generate subsidiary questions and allow you to interrogate competing interpretations. Early on, map out a realistic research plan with clear deadlines for reading, drafting and revision. Use a wide range of sources: contemporary documents, statistics, material culture where relevant, and current scholarly debate. Primary evidence is essential; without it you cannot meet the full criteria. As you research, record full bibliographic details and brief evaluative notes so you can recall why a source matters. Be prepared to adapt your plan when new evidence suggests a promising line of inquiry. The dissertation also assesses your ability to draw balanced, evidence-based conclusions and to show awareness of the limitations of the material you used.

## Practical skills: note‑taking, referencing and abstracts
Effective note‑taking and accurate referencing are practical skills that support better analysis and protect you against plagiarism. Notes should be accurate, concise and clearly referenced so you can trace any point back to its source. When making notes, prioritise evidence that adds value: statistics, striking examples, direct statements of interpretation by historians, and points of debate. Use the table of contents and indices of books to locate relevant passages quickly and summarise authors’ arguments in your own words. For referencing, adopt a consistent academic convention and record author, title, date, publisher and page numbers for books, and full URLs and access dates for online material. Your dissertation must include references and a bibliography; failure to show accurate referencing undermines the credibility of your work. The abstract is a short, precise summary of your dissertation’s problem, method, main findings and conclusion. A good abstract tells the reader what you did, why you did it, and what you discovered, in a compact form.

## Exam technique
Exam technique turns your knowledge and source skills into marks. Begin the paper by choosing the section you know best and reading the instructions for each question carefully. For Part A essays, plan briefly before writing: decide your argument, the factors you will assess, and the evidence you will use. Open with a direct answer to the question, then develop organised paragraphs that analyse rather than narrate, and finish with a clear, reflective conclusion that weighs evidence and addresses historiography. For source questions in Part B, allocate time so you can give each of the three questions a full response. For a ‘usefulness’ question, begin with provenance—who, when and why—then analyse content and situate the source in both its immediate historical context and the historiographical debate, finishing with a balanced judgement of usefulness. For a ‘how fully…?’ question, identify the source’s main claims and then introduce the wider factors needed to provide a complete explanation; make clear what the source leaves out. For two-source comparison questions, summarise each source’s view and then evaluate points of agreement and difference, bringing in recalled knowledge and explicit provenance discussion to explain why interpretations diverge. Practice timed answers to each question type so that you can structure a 12‑mark or 16‑mark answer confidently within the time allowed. In the dissertation, meet the formal requirements: observe the word limit, include at least one primary source, provide accurate references and submit a focused abstract. Remember that examiners reward clear argument, precise evidence, and thoughtful engagement with historical debate; your task in every answer is to show how evidence supports a carefully reasoned judgement.
