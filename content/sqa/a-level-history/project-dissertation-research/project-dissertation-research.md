# Project–dissertation research and referencing (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Understanding the project–dissertation: purpose and practical requirements
The Advanced Higher project–dissertation is an extended piece of independent historical research that allows you to investigate a complex issue in depth and to demonstrate research, analysis and historiographical awareness. It is worth 50 marks — 36% of the course assessment — and requires you to produce a single piece of work of up to 4,000 words, excluding references, bibliography and appendices. You must submit the final word count with your dissertation and be aware that exceeding the word limit by more than 10% will attract a penalty. The dissertation must include an abstract that summarises the research question, the approach taken, the main findings and the conclusion, and it must engage with current historiography as well as primary evidence. Your centre manages the project under SQA rules: the work is produced over a period of time under some supervision and is submitted for external marking and quality assurance by SQA.

## Choosing and refining a complex historical issue
A successful dissertation starts with an appropriate, sharply focused issue. The question should require analysis and judgement rather than pure description, and it should be manageable within 4,000 words. Good forms of question invite evaluation and comparison: for example, "How far did economic factors explain the decline of Party X?" or "Which interpretation better explains the causes of Event Y?" Avoid overly broad prompts such as "Describe the history of…" and aim instead for a question that produces a clear set of subsidiary issues you can address in sequence. Early on, negotiate your topic and title with your teacher; they will advise whether necessary sources are available and help you narrow the scope. Final titles may be phrased as questions, claims to be tested, or comparative prompts, but they must allow you to reach a reasoned overall conclusion supported by evidence and historiography.

## Research strategy and using primary and secondary sources
Plan your research before plunging into reading. Start with accessible background reading to build context, then identify specialised academic works and primary materials that bear directly on your question. Use library catalogues, academic journals, and university collections where possible; online repositories and digitised archives can be invaluable, but always check provenance and reliability. Primary sources might include official documents, letters, newspapers, statistical returns, photographs, speeches, or contemporary memoirs. Secondary sources are the work of historians and must be read critically: they offer interpretations you will engage with, accept, challenge or refine. At Advanced Higher level you must refer to at least one primary source: the assessment guidance makes clear that without reference to primary material a dissertation cannot reach the higher mark bands. When you collect evidence, think about provenance, purpose, date, intended audience and typicality. Corroboration with other sources strengthens claims; a lone source can be important but its limitations must be acknowledged.

## Note-taking, organising evidence and engaging with historiography
Effective note-taking turns research into usable material. Take accurate, concise and referenced notes that record author, title, page number, publication details and date of access for online items. Summarise argument and evidence in your own words where possible, and limit direct quotations to short, carefully chosen phrases that illuminate a point. Keep a running bibliography as you go to avoid last-minute searches and to make referencing straightforward. A literature review or matrix can help you map historians’ views and identify debates; for each work note the author’s thesis, the evidence used, strengths, weaknesses and any suggested further avenues of research. At Advanced Higher your dissertation must show historiographical awareness: simple name-dropping will not suffice. Instead, integrate historians’ arguments into your analysis, use them to frame alternative explanations, and show how your evidence supports or challenges them. This sustained engagement with interpretation is central to achieving high marks.

## Structuring and writing the dissertation
Structure your dissertation so that the reader is guided through the question, evidence and argument to a clear conclusion. A conventional approach begins with a brief introduction that frames the question, explains your approach and signposts the structure. Subsequent chapters or sections address the main sub-issues, develop evidence, and assess competing interpretations. Close with a conclusion that pulls the threads together, answers the question directly and reflects on limitations or further questions. Use sub-headings and short paragraphs to keep the argument clear; excessive narrative can dilute analysis. Write in formal academic English, avoiding contractions and colloquial language, and prefer phrases such as “this evidence suggests” or “this interpretation is supported by…”. The abstract appears at the front of the dissertation and should succinctly state the issue, method, principal findings and overall conclusion in a few well-crafted sentences. Appendices may include material that supports but does not belong in the main text, such as transcriptions, tables or extended statistics.

## Referencing and academic honesty
Consistent, accurate referencing is essential. Use a recognised referencing system (Harvard, Oxford, Chicago, MLA or APA) and follow it consistently throughout. Record full details for each source: author, date, title, publisher and page number for books, and for online sources include the URL and the date you accessed the material. Footnotes or endnotes should indicate specific page references for quotations and for the placement of particular facts or arguments; a bibliography lists everything you used. A simple example in an author–date style would be: Kershaw, Ian (2015) The Nazi Dictatorship, Bloomsbury, p. 74. If you employ ibid or op. cit. conventions, use them correctly and sparingly. Remember that long quotations are rarely useful: quote briefly and always analyse the quotation in context. Plagiarism is taken seriously. Your centre will have arrangements for supervision and authentication, such as regular progress meetings, spot-check interviews and requests for drafts or progress logs. Group work is permitted during the research phase, but the final dissertation must be entirely your own work. Reasonable assistance from teachers is allowed — for example help with planning or locating resources — but any targeted one-to-one input that changes the content of your work should be recorded and kept within SQA guidance.

## Assessment rules, submission and managing time
Your project is externally marked by SQA and the final mark contributes to your overall course grade. Plan a realistic timetable that includes topic selection, background reading, focused primary-source work, a literature review, writing, revision and referencing. Agree interim deadlines with your teacher for a research plan, progress reviews and a first draft; these checkpoints are part of the requirement that centres must supervise the work. Keep records of meetings and decisions; these can be useful if authenticity is queried. Submit the final dissertation on time, accompanied by the declared word count. Bear in mind that SQA applies a penalty for submissions that significantly exceed the word limit, and that absence of primary sources or inadequate referencing will cap the marks you can achieve. There are no restrictions on the resources you may use, but you must always reference them and be prepared to explain how you used them.

## Exam technique
When translating your research into the project–dissertation, think like an examiner. Address the question directly and keep your line of argument clear from the introduction to the conclusion. Use evidence selectively and analytically; every piece of material you include should help to answer the research question or to qualify a key claim. Integrate historiography so that historians’ arguments act as interlocutors within your discussion rather than decorative name-checks; explain why one interpretation is persuasive and another less so, tying this assessment tightly to primary evidence. In your writing, prioritise analysis and evaluation over narrative detail, and ensure each paragraph contributes to the development of your thesis. Proofread for clarity, accuracy and consistency of referencing. Finally, be prepared to justify methodological choices and source selection in any progress meeting: being able to explain why you used particular documents or why certain interpretations were favoured is part of demonstrating the scholarly control SQA expects at Advanced Higher level.
