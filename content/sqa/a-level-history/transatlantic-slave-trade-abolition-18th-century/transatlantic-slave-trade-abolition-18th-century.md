# Transatlantic slave trade and abolition (18th century) (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview and significance
The transatlantic slave trade of the 18th century was a central element in the making of the modern Atlantic world and in Britain’s rise as a commercial and imperial power. Enslaved Africans were carried across the Middle Passage to plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas where their labour produced sugar, tobacco and other commodities that entered British markets and fed factories, banks and ports. The human cost was enormous: forced displacement, high mortality on the sea voyage and brutal regimes on plantations. At the same time, this trade reshaped West African societies, European economies and the politics of empire. By the final decades of the century a complex campaign against the trade emerged in Britain and elsewhere, combining moral, religious and political pressures with changing economic and military circumstances. The parliamentary abolition of the British slave trade in 1807 marks a pivotal moment: it closed one legal channel of human trafficking under the British flag, though it left slavery itself intact in the colonies and did not end illegal trafficking.

## Development and scale of the trade in the 18th century
The trade grew steadily in the 18th century as European demand for tropical commodities rose. Ships from ports such as Liverpool, Bristol and London sailed a triangular pattern: manufactured goods to West Africa, enslaved people to the Caribbean, and plantation produce back to Europe. The number of enslaved people transported increased dramatically; estimates run into the millions across the century. The conditions of the Middle Passage were catastrophic for many: overcrowding, disease and violence produced high mortality rates, and survivors faced the violence of enslavement on arrival. The trade was organised through coastal forts, trading posts and so-called factories on the West African coast where European firms and African intermediaries negotiated the exchange of captives, goods and guns. This was not a monolithic process: different regions of Africa were affected in different ways, and the trade involved a mixture of coercion, local warfare, diplomacy and commerce. The scale of the trade made it a defining global institution of the century and a key subject for economic, social and moral debate.

## Importance to the British economy: ports, plantations and debates
Commercially, the trade linked British manufacturing, shipbuilding and finance to plantation agriculture. Caribbean sugar, refined and sold in British and European markets, generated large profits and created demand for shipping and insurance. Wealth accumulated in port towns and among merchant families, who invested in other industries and in the political life of Britain. This visible connection between slavery and prosperity made abolition a politically sensitive issue: those with economic interests in the trade resisted reform. However, by the late 18th century a significant historiographical debate had developed about the extent to which British industrialisation and national prosperity depended on enslaved labour. Some contemporaries and later historians argued that the system was less economically central than defenders had claimed; others insisted it remained highly profitable and integral to specific sectors. Politically and rhetorically this debate mattered, because abolitionists used questions about profitability to challenge the material argument for continuing the trade, while defenders used the alleged economic necessity to argue against abolition. In the classroom, it is useful to contrast the visible wealth of Liverpool merchants and Caribbean planters with the wider economic complexities of Britain’s industrial transition, asking how much the slave trade underpinned factories, credit and overseas markets.

## Impact on African societies
The trade transformed West African polities and economies. Some African rulers and elites participated directly in the trafficking of captives, using European firearms and manufactured goods to centralise power or to expand their own influence. In some areas new states and militarised slave-raiding economies emerged, while in others societies suffered demographic and social disruption through the loss of people, the undermining of traditional institutions and the intensification of inter-community violence. The long-term effects included the reorientation of local economic priorities and, in many cases, social fragmentation. It is important to stress that African agency was complex: resistance, negotiation and adaptation were all part of the dynamics. Teaching this topic requires care to avoid simplifying Africa’s role into passive victimhood; at the same time, students must recognise the scale of human suffering and coercion that accompanied the trade.

## Plantation life, plantation relations and resistance
Once disembarked, enslaved people entered highly controlled plantation regimes where power was exercised through violence, laws and everyday surveillance. Owners and overseers attempted to extract labour through systems such as tasking, gangs and punishments, and they shaped social relations through coerced family separation and sexual exploitation. Enslaved people however resisted in multiple ways: through work slowdowns, sabotage, flight, the formation of maroon communities, and, crucially, organised rebellions. Slave resistance forced planters and metropolitan politicians to think about control and security. The Haitian Revolution, which began in Saint-Domingue in 1791 and culminated in the creation of Haiti, profoundly influenced debates about slavery and abolition. The successful uprising of enslaved people challenged European assumptions about racial hierarchies and demonstrated both the agency of the enslaved and the instability inherent in plantation systems. For British planters the Haitian example induced fear of similar insurrections; for many in Britain and elsewhere it strengthened both abolitionist arguments and pro-slavery paranoia.

## The abolition movement and the obstacles it faced
By the late 18th century a broad abolitionist movement had emerged in Britain combining evangelical Christians, Quakers, radical writers, parliamentary reformers and ordinary citizens. Figures such as William Wilberforce provided parliamentary leadership, while activists like Thomas Clarkson gathered evidence, organised petitions and publicised the cruelty of the trade. First-hand accounts like Olaudah Equiano’s Autobiography put a human face on enslavement and helped to mobilise public opinion. High-profile cases such as the Zong massacre, where a slave ship crew threw enslaved people overboard and later sought insurance payment for the “loss,” created scandal and intensified moral outrage. Abolitionists skilfully used print, petitions and public meetings to create a humanitarian discourse that framed the trade as immoral and incompatible with Christian and Enlightenment values. Nevertheless, abolitionists confronted powerful obstacles. Planters, merchants and insurance interests who profited from slavery used parliamentary influence, press campaigns and economic arguments to resist reform. Racism and fears of social disorder undercut arguments for abolition among sections of the public and lawmakers. Moreover, imperial considerations complicated the matter: colonial administrations feared loss of revenue and social upheaval, and some politicians believed the empire’s prosperity depended on the system. Teaching this section profitably involves examining both the moral arguments and the entrenched economic and political interests that sustained the trade.

## Why abolition succeeded in 1807
The success of the abolitionist campaign in securing the Slave Trade Act of 1807 resulted from the interaction of moral agitation, political leadership, changing economic calculations and international circumstances. The sustained campaigning of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, energetic figures such as Wilberforce and Clarkson, and the circulation of eyewitness testimony gradually shifted public sentiment and parliamentary opinion. Religious and humanitarian arguments carried weight in an era of evangelical revival and reforming politics. Economically, the question of whether the trade remained as indispensable as its defenders claimed became more contestable; some industrialists and economists argued that Britain’s future lay in wage labour and manufacturing rather than slave-based agriculture. Internationally, Britain’s wars with revolutionary and Napoleonic France altered priorities: naval supremacy allowed Britain to interdict enemy commerce and to present itself as a moral leader, while the Haitian Revolution and other colonial disturbances made the security costs of the slave system more apparent. The Royal Navy, stretched across global theatres, could also be used after 1807 to suppress illegal trading. These converging pressures — moral, economic and strategic — combined to make the abolition of the trade a viable parliamentary policy. It is important to emphasise that 1807 ended the legal transatlantic trade under the British flag but did not emancipate those already enslaved; that struggle continued and culminated in further legislation in the 19th century.

## Exam technique
When answering SQA-style questions on the transatlantic slave trade and abolition, structure and evidence are essential. For extended-response questions that ask ‘To what extent…’ or ‘How important…’, begin with a concise thesis that judges the relative weight of factors, then organise the essay into clear analytical paragraphs that treat each factor in turn and link back to your overall judgement. Use specific examples to illustrate points: name ports (Liverpool, Bristol), cite key individuals (Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, Olaudah Equiano), mention cases that influenced opinion (the Zong), and refer to crucial events (the Haitian Revolution, 1791–1804). Where the question invites evaluation of economic importance, show awareness of historiographical debate by noting arguments that the trade was central to British wealth and contrasting views that industrial growth reduced that dependence; explain why such debates matter for the question. For source-based questions in the Scottish paper, place the source in context before discussing origin, purpose and content, and always link your comments directly to the question. When comparing two sources, identify the main interpretations each represents, use quotations to support your reading, and bring in recalled knowledge to show what the sources omit or underplay. Time management is vital: plan a brief outline for longer essays, allocate time for an introduction and conclusion, and ensure each paragraph advances your argument. Finally, practise past questions using the names, events and statistics you can recall so that your answers combine analytical clarity with precise, well-chosen evidence.
