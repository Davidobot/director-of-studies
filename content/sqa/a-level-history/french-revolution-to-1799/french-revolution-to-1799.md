# The French Revolution to 1799 (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction: scope and significance
The French Revolution transformed France and reshaped Europe between the late 1780s and the rise of Napoleon in 1799. What began as a crisis of royal finance and reform became a sustained revolutionary upheaval that overthrew the Ancien Régime, experimented with liberal constitutionalism, descended into radical republicanism and terror, and ended with a new authoritarian settlement — the Consulate. For A‑level study, it is helpful to trace the sequence of events (causes, key phases and outcomes) while also weighing the relative importance of structural pressures, contingency and individual choices. The Revolution is rich in examples for students: the Estates‑General of 1789, the storming of the Bastille, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, the flight to Varennes, the Reign of Terror and the coup of 18 Brumaire which brought Napoleon to power. Understanding both narrative and interpretation is essential for balanced essays and informed judgment.

## The Ancien Régime and threats before 1789
Eighteenth‑century France was a highly unequal, hierarchical society organised around the monarchy, the privileged orders of clergy and nobility, and the unprivileged Third Estate. The crown’s finances were chronically strained by a combination of costly war debts, an inefficient and unfair tax system, and a rigid political structure in which parlements, ministries and vested interests resisted reform. Ministers such as Calonne and Brienne offered different schemes for raising revenue or reforming taxation, but their failure to secure acceptance — and the dismissal of Calonne in 1787 — exposed the monarchy’s weakness. Beyond finance, intellectual currents associated with the Enlightenment challenged traditional authority, while the practical example of the American Revolution showed that political change was conceivable and could succeed. Social tensions were also acute: agrarian distress, poor harvests in the late 1780s that pushed up bread prices, and a growing, politically conscious bourgeoisie all contributed to a sense that the status quo was unstable. By 1789 these structural pressures, coupled with short‑term crises and the monarchy’s inability to act decisively, made a convocation of the Estates‑General necessary and dangerous.

## Immediate causes and the outbreak of revolution, 1789
The calling of the Estates‑General in May 1789 was intended by the crown to resolve the financial crisis, but it quickly became a forum for constitutional confrontation. The Third Estate’s demand for voting by head rather than by order, and the formation of the National Assembly in June 1789, marked a decisive claim to sovereign authority. The popular unrest in Paris during the summer — driven by fear of military repression, rumours and shortages — culminated in the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a symbolically charged action which expressed urban political mobilisation. In August the National Assembly passed the August Decrees that abolished feudal privileges and in late August adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, setting out the principles of popular sovereignty, equality before the law and individual rights. The October Days, when thousands of Parisian women and market traders marched to Versailles demanding bread and forcing the royal family to move to Paris, underlined that revolution was under popular pressure as well as parliamentary transformation. These early months combined legal reform, symbolic rupture and popular action in a way that dismantled the legal basis of the Ancien Régime while creating new expectations of political participation.

## Constitutional monarchy and its collapse, 1789–1792
Between 1789 and 1791 the Revolution attempted to fashion a constitutional monarchy. The National Assembly restructured local and national government, nationalised Church lands to tackle fiscal problems and produced the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790, which subordinated the Church to the state and required an oath of loyalty from clergy — a reform with profound social and religious consequences. The Constitution of 1791 established a legislative assembly and limited the king’s authority, but it relied on a delicate balance of royal cooperation and moderate political culture. The king’s hesitations and actions undermined this balance. His flight to Varennes in June 1791, in which Louis XVI attempted to join émigré forces and foreign allies, shattered public confidence and made compromise difficult. The international dimension was crucial: émigrés and other royalists sought foreign intervention, while fear of foreign invasion and counter‑revolution pushed many revolutionaries toward more radical positions. The Legislative Assembly declared war on Austria in April 1792; military failure and internal unrest, compounded by the threatening Brunswick Manifesto and growing street radicalism, culminated in the insurrection of 10 August 1792, the suspension of the monarchy and the arrest of the king. The experiment in constitutional monarchy collapsed under the combined weight of royal duplicity, social mobilisation and international crisis.

## Radicalisation, war and the Terror, 1792–95
The republic proclaimed in September 1792 entered a period of existential struggle. Military setbacks, foreign coalitions and internal counter‑revolution — most notably the Vendean uprising — produced a climate of emergency in which revolutionary government adopted extraordinary powers. Factions within the revolutionary movement competed fiercely: the more moderate Girondins feared Jacobin centralism and popular pressure, while the Montagnards, allied with Parisian sans‑culottes, pushed for vigorous defence of the republic. The trial and execution of Louis XVI in January 1793 symbolised the Revolution’s turn toward irrevocable rupture with monarchy. Faced with threats at home and abroad, the Committee of Public Safety, with Robespierre a central figure, implemented measures to centralise power, mobilise resources (the levée en masse) and suppress dissent. The Reign of Terror, constrained more by politics than by a single plan, operated through revolutionary tribunals and laws such as the Law of Suspects. It sought to defend the Revolution but also created paranoia, repression and regional resistance. The fall of Robespierre in Thermidor (July 1794) ended the most intense phase of the Terror and ushered in a reaction against Jacobin dictatorship, but the Revolution’s political landscape remained unsettled.

## The Directory and the road to the Consulate, 1795–99
After Thermidor, the new constitution of Year III (1795) created a bicameral legislature and a five‑man Directory intended to avoid both royal restoration and Jacobin dictatorship. The Directory faced chronic problems: economic dislocation, political corruption, factional conflict and continued war in Europe. It relied increasingly on the military to secure its rule, using generals to suppress uprisings and to project power abroad. This reliance exposed the regime’s fragility and popular legitimacy problems. In this context the figure of Napoleon Bonaparte emerged as the military leader capable of decisive action. The coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) was orchestrated by political figures such as Sieyès and carried out with the support of Bonaparte’s troops. The Directory was overthrown and the Consulate established under a new constitution (Year VIII), with Napoleon as First Consul. The Consulate marked the end of the revolutionary decade and the beginning of a new authoritarian stability that claimed to preserve certain gains of the Revolution while restoring order.

## Impact on social groups and long‑term consequences up to 1799
The Revolution had uneven impacts across French society. Peasants benefited from the abolition of feudal dues and the redistribution or sale of Church lands, strengthening rural property rights in many areas. Urban workers experienced volatile outcomes: early revolutionary measures promised relief and political voice, but chronic inflation, price instability and later repression under the Directory often left them disappointed. The bourgeoisie consolidated political and economic gains through access to state positions, secularisation of property and a legal order that protected property and commerce. The clergy were profoundly affected by the Civil Constitution and subsequent dechristianisation campaigns in some regions; many non‑juring priests and religious communities suffered, and the Church’s social authority was diminished. The nobility were split: émigrés lost land and influence, while those who remained and adapted could find a role in the new regime. Politically, the Revolution spread new ideas of citizenship, secular law and nationalism across Europe, while also provoking conservative reaction. By 1799 France had experienced radical social transformation and institutional innovation, but also violence, instability and a collapse of longstanding political norms.

## Interpreting the Revolution: causes, contingency and debate
Historians continue to debate the relative weight of structural causes and contingency. Some interpretations stress long‑term social and economic pressures — fiscal exhaustion, agrarian change and class tensions — while others emphasise immediate triggers like the crown’s financial crisis and the specific failures of ministers. The role of ideas — Enlightenment thought and the American example — is contested: ideas provided a vocabulary and justification for change, but they do not alone explain popular mobilisation. Agency and contingency matter: Louis XVI’s indecision, the actions of revolutionary leaders, the choices of Parisian crowds, and the timing of wars all shaped outcomes in ways that were not predetermined. There is also debate over interpretation of the Terror: was it a necessary, if tragic, defence of the Revolution against annihilation, or an avoidable descent into authoritarian violence? For students, the best approach is to combine a secure narrative of events with critical evaluation, showing how structural pressures, individual decisions and international dynamics interacted to produce revolutionary change.

## Exam technique
When answering a question on the French Revolution to 1799, begin by mapping the question carefully and deciding on a clear, focused thesis. For causation questions, set out the main factors you will assess and indicate an evaluative judgement at the start: this guides the reader and frames your argument. Use precise chronology: mention key events such as the Estates‑General (May 1789), the storming of the Bastille (14 July 1789), the Declaration of the Rights of Man (26 August 1789), the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790), the flight to Varennes (June 1791), the proclamation of the Republic (September 1792), the Terror (1793–94) and the coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799). Support your points with specific examples and explain their relevance to the question; avoid narrative that does not link back to argument. When asked to evaluate, give weight to different explanations, weigh their strengths and limitations, and consider timing and contingency. Use comparative and counter‑factual phrasing when appropriate — for example, consider how events might have differed if Louis had acted differently or if France had not been at war. In source or interpretation‑based questions, identify the author’s perspective, purpose and limitations, and use contextual knowledge to corroborate or challenge the source. Structure responses with coherent paragraphs that begin with a clear point, develop evidence and analysis, and lead to a succinct conclusion that answers the question directly. Finally, time your work so you can plan, write and review: an organised plan at the start saves time and improves clarity, and a brief conclusion helps secure marks by showing explicit judgement.
