# Scotland 1707–1815: Union to the Enlightenment (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Overview: themes and turning points
The period 1707–1815 in Scotland is defined by major economic, social and cultural transformations set against the political reality of union with England. The Treaty of Union (1707) created a single British state and opened markets and imperial opportunities that some Scots seized with great energy. At the same time the century saw violent episodes of resistance — most notably the Jacobite risings — and a slow but profound remaking of Highland society. Across the Lowlands, agricultural improvement, commercial expansion and early industrialisation produced new wealth and new problems: the growth of Glasgow as a mercantile city, the rise of the “tobacco lords”, overcrowded towns and the beginnings of factory production. Culturally, the era culminated in the Scottish Enlightenment, in which philosophers, scientists and historians transformed intellectual life and made Scotland a centre of European thought. The themes running through the period are therefore conflict and accommodation, improvement and displacement, and a powerful cultural confidence expressed in education, literature and the built environment.

## The Treaty of Union and the expanding economy
The Treaty of Union removed the Scottish Parliament and created a united Parliament at Westminster, but it also provided access to colonial markets and the protection of a larger navy. For some Scottish merchants and planters this was transformative. Glasgow, which before Union had been a modest provincial town, became a hub for transatlantic trade in tobacco and, later, sugar and rum. Wealthy merchants known as the tobacco lords amassed fortunes by importing American tobacco and re-exporting it to Europe. Their capital financed city building, philanthropic ventures and investment in rural estates and manufacturing. Glasgow’s rapid expansion illustrates how integration into the British imperial economy could generate extraordinary local wealth.

However, the benefits of Union were uneven. Many Scots were disappointed by the loss of political independence; others profited handsomely. Trade growth stimulated related industries — shipbuilding, rope-making and commerce — and over the century a gradual shift from a largely subsistence economy in some regions to a market-orientated one became apparent. The new economic dynamism also exposed social fault-lines: urban expansion produced overcrowded tenements and poor sanitary conditions, while commercial success rested in part on plantation slavery and the exploitation of colonial labour. These contradictions are central to interpreting Scotland’s 18th-century trajectory.

## Jacobitism, the Highlands and the ‘45
Jacobitism — support for the Stuart claim to the British throne — had both dynastic and social roots. The 1715 rising reflected continuing Highland loyalties and the ambitions of a disaffected elite who hoped to restore the Stuart line. That attempt failed, and the limited 1719 rising ended quickly, but both episodes revealed persistent resentments about Union, the displacement of traditional elites and the complex loyalties of border and Highland regions.

The 1745 rising led by Charles Edward Stuart enjoyed dramatic early successes and reached as far south as Derby, before collapsing at Culloden in 1746. The aftermath of 1746 marked a decisive turning-point for the Highlands. The government implemented measures designed to pacify and assimilate Highland society: the Disarming Acts, the proscription of clan dress, and the strengthening of military garrisons. Legislation and changing economic imperatives altered the pattern of landholding and power. Landowners, often incentivised by rising agricultural rents and new pastoral possibilities, reorganised estates for sheep farming and commercial agriculture. This process, uneven in pace and consequence, set the stage for the later Highland Clearances: mass evictions and enforced migration that accelerated after 1760 and continued into the early nineteenth century, producing emigration to the Americas and the Lowlands and reshaping Gaelic culture.

It is important to balance accounts of Highland “destruction” with the recognition that many changes were also driven by Highland landlords themselves, seeking to modernise and profit from agricultural improvement. Still, the social cost — loss of traditional tenures, forced relocation to crofting communities or emigration — was substantial and became a defining moral and political issue for later generations.

## Improvement, agriculture and the growth of industry
Across Lowland Scotland the eighteenth century was an era of “improvement”: the deliberate application of new farming methods, enclosure, drainage, crop rotation and selective breeding. Landowners and a group of educated gentlemen known as “the Improvers” promoted agricultural experiments and the dissemination of knowledge. The Statistical Account of Scotland, compiled by parish ministers in the 1790s, both reflected and encouraged interest in improvement by recording local conditions, yields and innovations. Improvement raised productivity and produced surpluses that could support urban growth and industrial development.

Industrialisation in Scotland took distinctive forms. Linen and later cotton textiles became important employers, while coal and iron extraction expanded in the Central Belt. The introduction of new machinery — water frames and steam engines — and improvements in transport, such as better roads, canals and coastal shipping, facilitated the movement of raw materials and finished goods. Towns like Glasgow and Dundee grew rapidly; Glasgow’s population explosion is the best-known example of urban growth tied to commercial fortunes.

Yet economic growth did not translate into uniformly higher living standards. Rapid urbanisation generated congested housing, public health problems and a precarious existence for many workers. Rural improvements often meant displacement for labouring tenants. The period therefore creates a mixed picture: rising aggregate wealth, new employment opportunities, and the modernisation of the economy, alongside social dislocation and the emergence of a class of industrial and agricultural labourers whose conditions would become the focus of later reform movements.

## Politics, the Kirk and the impact of the French Revolution
Politically, Scotland after 1707 retained distinctive institutions and culture while becoming part of a larger British political system. Patronage and networks of influence were central: a dominant figure in late-eighteenth-century Scottish politics was Henry Dundas, whose control of patronage has been termed the “Dundas despotism.” Such networks helped maintain a measure of stability but also generated resentment and accusations of corruption. The era of the French Revolution and the wars with Revolutionary and Napoleonic France (from 1789) provoked anxiety among Britain’s political elite. Radical ideas spread among sections of the population, producing movements for reform and popular agitation that the state sometimes met with repression.

Religion remained a key axis of social life. The Church of Scotland (the Kirk) was internally divided between moderates, who emphasised civic order, reason and accommodation with the Enlightenment, and evangelicals, who stressed spiritual revival and doctrinal purity. Disputes over patronage — the right of landowners to appoint ministers — led to secessions and the growth of rival denominations during the century. The Kirk’s changing role paralleled wider social shifts: education, social welfare and moral authority all came under debate as urbanisation and market forces remade communities.

## The Scottish Enlightenment: ideas, institutions and culture
The Scottish Enlightenment is a headline achievement of the period and provides a cultural counterpoint to the economic and political transformations already discussed. Edinburgh, Glasgow and other towns were centres of vigorous intellectual life. Philosophers and men of letters such as David Hume, Adam Smith, William Robertson and Lord Kames advanced new approaches to history, political economy, moral philosophy and jurisprudence. Their work was rooted in an empirical, sceptical tradition and stressed practical improvement, civic virtue and commercial society.

Universities were central to this intellectual flourishing. Edinburgh’s medical school and the chairs at Glasgow and Aberdeen fostered scientific advances: Joseph Black’s chemistry and James Hutton’s geological theories are two striking examples of how Scottish thinkers contributed to modern science. The academy movement and reform of schools expanded access to literacy and learning; the Scottish system of parish schools and the efforts of bodies such as the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) shaped education and reflect debates about language, religion and assimilation, particularly in Gaelic-speaking areas.

Cultural achievements went beyond philosophy and science to architecture, literature and town planning. The New Town of Edinburgh, built in a neoclassical style, and the work of architects like Robert Adam embodied Enlightenment aesthetics. In literature, poets such as Robert Burns drew on Scots dialect and folk traditions, giving voice to a distinct cultural identity even as Scotland became more integrated within Britain. The Enlightenment’s cosmopolitanism and practical orientation helped to make Scotland a hub of ideas that resonated across Britain and Europe.

## Exam technique
Approach essays and sources with a clear plan and an awareness of the skills the exam tests. For 25-mark essay questions, begin with a focused thesis that directly answers the question, and outline the structure of your argument. Develop each paragraph around a clear point supported by specific evidence: legislative acts, key events (for example 1746 Culloden), economic data (growth of Glasgow, expansion of textile manufacture), and the views of historians. Integrate historiography meaningfully: explain how historians differ on the causes or consequences of an event and use that debate to refine your own judgement rather than relying on memorised quotations. Conclude by weighing the evidence and showing the degree of certainty possible given the sources and interpretations.

For Part B source questions, always attend to provenance (who wrote the source, when and why), content (what it says), and context (how it fits into wider events and debates). In a 12-mark “usefulness” question you must link provenance to limitations as well as strengths and show how other knowledge supports or challenges the source. In “How fully…?” tasks, identify the source’s main claims and then supply the missing strands of evidence from your recall that would give a fuller account. For the 16-mark two-source question, establish the views of each source, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and use wider knowledge to explain why they differ: are they writing from different social positions, political aims, or access to information?

Time management is crucial in the three-hour paper: allocate roughly equal time to Parts A and B, leaving time to plan and proofread. Plans help ensure coherent structure and avoid narrative drift. Use brief plans at the start of responses even under exam conditions. Evidence and historiography should be woven into analysis rather than tacked on.

For the project–dissertation, choose a sharply focused, historiographically rich question that permits evaluation and synthesis rather than mere description. Use a balance of primary and secondary sources, keep meticulous references, and draft an abstract that states the issue, method, principal findings and conclusion. Follow the word limit (4,000 words) and conventions for referencing and bibliography; failure to include at least one primary source will constrain the mark you can achieve. Throughout your revision and research, practise writing timed essays, annotate sources with provenance notes, and develop a small repertoire of well-understood case studies — the Treaty of Union, the 1745 rising and Culloden, the Statistical Account, Adam Smith and David Hume — that you can adapt to a range of questions.
