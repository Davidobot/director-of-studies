# The Cold War in Europe, 1945–1989 (A-level History Scottish Qualifications Authority)

## Introduction and overview
The Cold War in Europe was a prolonged, multifaceted confrontation between the Soviet-led East and the US-led West that shaped politics, society and diplomacy for almost half a century. It was not a single event but a series of crises, policies and long-term processes: the breakdown of wartime alliance politics, competing ideologies of communism and liberal democracy, an accelerating arms race, and the creation of opposing security and economic blocs. To understand this period we need to follow both high politics — treaties, summits and leaders’ decisions — and structural pressures such as economic recovery, national resistance within the Soviet bloc, and the impact of nuclear weapons. The European Cold War was characterised by containment and competition rather than direct superpower war; it produced proxy conflicts, political repression in the East, and a gradual shift from confrontation to managed détente and, finally, to the collapse of communist regimes by 1989.

## Origins and early crises, 1945–1955
The Cold War in Europe emerged from the wartime alliance’s deep disagreements about security, ideology and the fate of Germany. The United States and its allies promoted reconstruction and market economies, while the Soviet Union prioritised security and communist regimes friendly to Moscow. Early crises made the division explicit: the breakdown over postwar settlements in Germany, the introduction of the Marshall Plan as economic and political containment, and the Truman Doctrine signalling ideological opposition to Soviet expansion. The Berlin Blockade of 1948–49 was a crucial flashpoint; the airlift that sustained West Berlin demonstrated Western resolve and led to formal consolidation: the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, and the foundation of NATO in 1949 in response to perceived Soviet threats. The Soviet response included the establishment of COMECON and, in 1955, the Warsaw Pact, turning Europe into two opposing military and economic blocs. These early years set patterns of rivalry, deterrence and spheres of influence that lasted for decades.

## Soviet control of Eastern Europe and responses, up to 1961
Soviet control over Eastern Europe was achieved through a mix of wartime occupation, political manipulation, and the placement of communist parties in power, followed by mechanisms to bind those states to Moscow: purges, security services, economic integration and military guarantees. The Prague-style imposition of pro-Soviet governments in the late 1940s, collectivisation and show trials created resentments. Resistance and unrest periodically erupted, most notably in 1956 when de-Stalinisation under Khrushchev sparked uprisings in Poland and Hungary. Poland achieved negotiated concessions, while the Hungarian revolt was crushed with Soviet force, showing the limits of reform inside the bloc. Western responses were constrained by the reality of Soviet military superiority in Eastern Europe and the overriding fear of nuclear escalation. The Berlin crisis of 1961, culminating in the construction of the Berlin Wall, symbolised the physical and ideological sealing of Cold War Europe. Teaching this period benefits from exploring how local, national and superpower interests intersected, and from assessing whether Soviet control relied more on consent, coercion, or a mixture of both.

## Flashpoints and escalation: Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam
The early 1960s brought both the most dangerous nuclear confrontation and the intensification of indirect conflict. The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 brought the world to the brink of nuclear war when the Soviet Union placed ballistic missiles in Cuba and the United States reacted with a naval blockade and fearful brinkmanship. The crisis ended with negotiation: Soviet withdrawal of the missiles in exchange for a public US pledge not to invade Cuba and a secret American removal of missiles from Turkey. The episode highlighted the risks of the arms race and the importance of communication and crisis management. Meanwhile, Europe was affected by wider Cold War competition in the Third World. The war in Vietnam, though fought in Asia, had political repercussions in Europe: anti-war movements, NATO debates over strategy, and the intellectual challenge it posed to claims of Western moral superiority. The United States’ struggles in Vietnam — difficult guerrilla warfare, limits of military power, and shifting domestic opinion — illustrated the limits of conventional military approaches against determined nationalist or revolutionary movements and fed debates over containment versus negotiation.

## Détente and the attempt to manage the Cold War, 1962–1979
After the near catastrophe of 1962, both superpowers sought ways to stabilise relations. The period of détente involved arms-control talks, trade agreements and diplomatic engagement intended to reduce the danger of direct confrontation. SALT I, signed in 1972, limited some strategic systems and introduced verification mechanisms, while the Helsinki Accords of 1975 linked security recognition with human rights language, creating a framework that Eastern dissidents could later exploit. Economically, increased trade and technology exchanges provided incentives for coexistence. However, détente was never simple or linear: competition continued in third-party conflicts and in the ideological sphere. Tensions over human rights, Soviet suppression of dissent, and differing regional policies exposed the fragility of détente. The late 1970s saw its erosion as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 ended the hopes of a sustained détente and led to renewed hostility, an American-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics and the hardening of rhetoric on both sides.

## Decline of communism and the end of the Cold War, 1979–1989
The final phase of the Cold War combined economic strain, political reform and popular resistance. The Soviet Union’s prolonged intervention in Afghanistan drained resources and intensified international isolation. Economically, long-term stagnation, inefficient central planning and the burden of arms spending weakened Soviet capacity to compete. Politically, Mikhail Gorbachev’s arrival in 1985 introduced new dynamics: his policies of glasnost and perestroika aimed at openness and economic restructuring undermined the old controls, encouraged public debate and exposed systemic failures. Gorbachev also signalled a change in Soviet foreign policy, withdrawing support for hardline repression and preferring negotiation over force. This shift empowered reform movements: Solidarity in Poland moved from illegality to negotiation and victory in 1989, Hungary opened its borders, East German protests culminated in the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, and communist governments across Eastern Europe fell in rapid succession. By 1989 the Cold War’s European dimension had ended: the bipolar division collapsed not through war but through negotiated and popular political change stemming from a mix of internal reform, economic crisis and international diplomacy.

## Teaching points and interpretative issues
When teaching the Cold War in Europe, it is helpful to emphasise both structure and contingency. Structural explanations stress ideological conflict, the security needs of postwar states and economic systems; contingency emphasises the roles of individual leaders, miscalculation, and specific crises such as Berlin or Cuba. Students should be encouraged to compare short-term catalysts with long-term causes: for instance, Khrushchev’s de‑Stalinisation was an immediate trigger for 1956 unrest, but deeper economic and social stresses underlay the durability of Soviet rule. Encourage use of case studies — the Berlin Blockade, the Hungarian uprising, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Helsinki process, and the revolutions of 1989 — as means to assess continuity and change. Assignments that weigh competing explanations (ideological vs. economic vs. leadership) help students develop balanced arguments. Finally, examine the human dimension: how ordinary people experienced division, propaganda and insecurity, and how dissident movements used new international norms to press for change.

## Exam technique
Approach Cold War questions by planning an argument before you write. For essays, start with a clear thesis that answers the question and maps the main points you will use to support it. Each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence, develop the idea with specific factual detail (dates, events, outcomes), analyse the significance of the evidence and link back to your overall argument — this creates a clear chain of reasoning. For evaluation and "to what extent" questions, balance different interpretations and weigh their relative importance rather than merely listing causes. Use precise examples: refer to the Berlin Airlift (1948–49) when discussing early confrontation, to Hungary (1956) and Berlin (1961) for limits of Soviet tolerance, to October 1962 for crisis management, to SALT and Helsinki for détente, and to Gorbachev, Solidarity and the fall of the Berlin Wall for 1989.

For source-based Scottish-style questions, address origin, purpose, content and context. When asked to evaluate usefulness, explain what the source uniquely contributes and what it omits, using recalled knowledge to show those omissions. For "How fully…" questions, judge the extent to which the source explains the issue and provide specific supplementary facts. For two-source comparison questions, identify similarities and differences in interpretation, support these with quotations or specific references to the sources, and use outside knowledge to assess where each source is limited or one-sided.

Time management matters: in a 90-minute paper, allocate time so you can plan and re-read your longer answers. Leave a few minutes at the end to check reasoning, spelling and dates. Use a confident, analytical tone, avoid over-generalisation, and always aim to connect detailed facts to the bigger argument about causes, consequences and significance. Clear structure, precise knowledge and balanced analysis are the keys to high-scoring answers.
