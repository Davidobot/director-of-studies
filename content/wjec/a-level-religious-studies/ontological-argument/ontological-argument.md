# Ontological Argument (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview and context
The Ontological Argument is one of the classic philosophical attempts to prove God's existence by purely conceptual means. Unlike cosmological or teleological arguments, which are inductive and appeal to empirical features of the world, the Ontological Argument is deductive and a priori: it seeks to show that the very concept of God entails God's existence. This makes it a crucial topic in the Philosophy of Religion section of the WJEC/Eduqas specification because it tests students on issues about meaning, necessity, metaphysics and the limits of philosophical reasoning. The argument has a long history, beginning with St Anselm in the medieval period and resurfacing in new forms through thinkers such as René Descartes and twentieth‑century analytic philosophers. Understanding its logic, its key terms (such as "necessary" and "contingent"), and the major objections is essential for a balanced AO1 presentation and a critical AO2 evaluation.

## What “a priori” and “deductive” mean here
To engage with the Ontological Argument properly you must be clear about two technical ideas. An a priori argument is one whose premises can be known independently of sensory experience; it relies on reason and analysis of concepts rather than empirical observation. A deductive argument aims to guarantee its conclusion: if the premises are true, the conclusion must follow. The Ontological Argument claims that the concept of God — if properly understood as the greatest or most perfect being — already includes existence in such a way that denying God’s existence is self‑contradictory. Teaching emphasis should therefore be on tracing the move from conceptual analysis to metaphysical conclusion and on testing whether the claimed necessity is legitimate.

## Anselm’s original formulation
St Anselm of Canterbury (11th century) framed the argument in short, powerful steps in his Proslogion. He begins by defining God as “that than which nothing greater can be conceived.” Anselm then asks us to compare two modes of existence: existence in the understanding alone and existence in reality as well as in the understanding. His key move is this: if God exists only in the understanding, then we can conceive of a greater being — one that exists both in the understanding and in reality. But since God is by definition the greatest conceivable being, the possibility of a greater being is impossible. Therefore God must exist not only in the understanding but in reality. Anselm also offers a version that treats God as possessing necessary existence: the greatest conceivable being is such that it cannot be thought not to exist; to think otherwise is incoherent. When teaching Anselm, it helps to reconstruct his reasoning in short syllogistic form for clarity while emphasising that his method is intended as a reductio ad absurdum against the atheist’s imagined position.

## Descartes and later developments: perfection and necessity
Descartes adapts Anselm’s move into early modern philosophy by arguing that existence is among the perfections that belong to a supremely perfect being. For Descartes, just as having three angles of a triangle is essential to the concept of a triangle, existence belongs to the concept of a supremely perfect being. Therefore God, by definition, must exist. This formulation stresses the analogy between mathematical or conceptual truths and divine attributes.

Norman Malcolm modified the argument in the twentieth century by focusing on the idea of necessary existence. Malcolm argued that either God necessarily exists or God’s non‑existence is necessary; there is no middle ground of contingent existence for the divine. If God’s non‑existence is not necessary, then God’s existence must be necessary. Malcolm’s approach reframes Anselmian reasoning in modal terms and invites students to consider carefully what it means for existence to be necessary as opposed to contingent.

A significant modern extension, often discussed in A‑level contexts, is the modal Ontological Argument. This argument uses modal logic: if it is possible that a maximally great or necessary being exists (that is, if such a being is possible in at least one possible world), then that being exists in every possible world and so exists in our world. The modal version tightens Anselm’s point but also raises new questions about modal premises.

## Classic objections: Gaunilo and Kant
Objections to the Ontological Argument begin almost immediately. A contemporary of Anselm named Gaunilo responded with the famous “perfect island” parody. Gaunilo asked us to imagine the greatest conceivable island: by Anselm’s logic one could supposedly prove the island exists simply by conceiving it as the greatest, which is absurd. His point is that Anselm’s form of argument could be used to “prove” the existence of anything by defining it into being, so the method must be faulty.

Immanuel Kant offered a deeper philosophical critique by challenging the move that treats existence as a predicate or a real property. Kant argued that existence does not add anything to the concept of a thing; it does not function like other properties (such as omnipotence or wisdom). Saying “God exists” does not attribute a further quality to God but simply posits that the concept is instantiated. Thus, according to Kant, Anselm’s step that turns conceptual greatness into real existence illegitimately treats existence as a property, and so the argument fails. Teaching this objection requires making clear the analytic/synthetic distinction and why treating existence as a property is problematic.

Gaunilo’s and Kant’s criticisms are distinct: Gaunilo targets the method by parody, showing possible absurd consequences, while Kant targets the conceptual move that is central to Anselm and Descartes. Both objections are pivotal for a balanced AO2 critique.

## Responses and modern answers
Defenders of the Ontological Argument have developed several responses to the traditional objections. A common Anselmian reply to Gaunilo is that the argument only works for a being whose non‑existence is logically impossible — an island is a contingent thing and so the parody fails because islands cannot possess necessary existence. The response emphasises that God’s status as a necessary being sets Him apart from contingent entities and blocks the parody.

Replies to Kant often focus on clarifying what is meant by “existence” in the Ontological context. Some defenders claim that Anselm’s claim concerns not existence as a simple predicate but a special metaphysical mode of existence: necessary existence. If necessary existence is understood as a distinctive property (rather than mere instantiation), Kant’s objection is less damaging. More sophisticated replies employ modal logic. Alvin Plantinga, for example, reframes the argument using possible worlds: if it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then that being exists necessarily. Teaching the modal approach should be done carefully, allowing students to grasp the key modal operators (possible/necessary) and why the “possible” premise matters.

Critics reply to modal formulations by challenging the initial modal premise: is it coherent to assert that a maximally great being is possible? If the concept itself is incoherent, the argument collapses. Thus much of the contemporary debate turns on whether the notion of a necessarily existing, maximally great being is intelligible.

## Strengths, weaknesses and wider significance
When evaluating the Ontological Argument, it is useful to separate philosophical strengths from psychological or theological implications. A major strength is that the argument shows how philosophical analysis of concepts can have powerful metaphysical consequences; it forces philosophers to examine the relationship between thought and reality and highlights the significance of modal concepts such as necessity. For some the argument has persuasive force because it purports to show that denial of God involves a logical inconsistency.

Weaknesses are substantive. If the argument relies on contentious premises — that the concept of the greatest being is coherent, or that existence can be treated as a special kind of property — then it will not be persuasive to sceptics. The argument is also vulnerable to charges of question‑begging: critics say that the argument assumes what it seeks to prove by importing existence into the initial concept of God. Furthermore, the Ontological Argument is remote from empirical verification, which makes it less persuasive to those who prioritise evidence from the world (as in cosmological or teleological arguments).

Pedagogically, it is helpful to link the Ontological Argument to other parts of the specification. Discussion of Anselm’s reasoning connects to questions about religious language and whether religious claims are cognitive. Modal forms of the argument engage with metaphysics and the philosophy of necessity, while objections by Kant invite students to revisit distinctions between analytic and synthetic propositions and the nature of predicates. These connections help students achieve synoptic thinking and provide richer AO2 evaluation.

## Typical criticisms students should be able to write about
When preparing essays, students should be able to explain Gaunilo’s island objection and Kant’s claim that existence is not a predicate, along with the modal critiques and the ways defenders try to meet these challenges. They should also consider whether the argument’s abstractness counts against its persuasive power in religious practice, and whether the argument, even if sound, persuades anyone who does not already accept its conceptual premises. Finally, students should be ready to compare the Ontological Argument with inductive arguments: does a purely a priori argument carry the same epistemic weight as an argument grounded in observable features of the universe?

## Exam technique
To score well in an A‑level exam question on the Ontological Argument, start with a clear definition of terms and a concise statement of the argument you will discuss; this fulfils AO1 requirements. For a question asking for explanation, set out Anselm’s reasoning step by step in clear prose, then explain later formulations by Descartes and the modal version so examiners can see breadth of knowledge. For evaluation questions allocate about half of your answer to AO2: present Gaunilo and Kant carefully, explain why their objections are serious, and then present considered rebuttals such as the necessary/contingent distinction and modal responses. Use comparative points to show synoptic understanding, for example by contrasting a priori and a posteriori arguments to show strengths and weaknesses.

Structure each paragraph so that one sentence states a point, the next explains it, and the next offers critical engagement. Link back to the question throughout and conclude with a balanced judgement that weighs the argument’s philosophical interest against its practical persuasiveness. Where relevant, signpost the examiner to the scholarship by naming key thinkers (Anselm, Descartes, Kant, Gaunilo, Malcolm, Plantinga) and show how their positions differ. Finally, use precise terminology (necessary/contingent, a priori/a posteriori, predicate, modal possibility), because correct use of specialist language gains marks and shows intellectual command of the topic.
