# Situation Ethics (Fletcher) (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction and historical context
Situation Ethics is the best known practical ethic of the twentieth century and is closely associated with the American theologian Joseph Fletcher. Writing primarily in the 1950s and 1960s and most famously in his book Situation Ethics (1966), Fletcher formulated a moral approach intended as an alternative to rigid rule-based systems and to permissive subjectivism. He argued from a Christian starting point but aimed to produce a working ethic that would be intelligible and useful in a modern, pluralistic world. Situation Ethics emerged in a context where questions about the adequacy of received moral rules, the demands of love in concrete situations, and the authority of conscience were being widely debated in theology, philosophy and pastoral practice.

## The central idea: agape as the ruling norm
At the heart of Fletcher’s ethical system is the claim that agape — selfless, unconditional love — is the only intrinsic good and should be the guiding principle in moral decision-making. For Fletcher, agape is not sentimental or merely emotional; it is an active, principled concern for the good of others. He summarises his position by saying that love ought to be the “boss principle” in ethics. Rather than following laws because they are laws, moral agents should ask what the most loving thing to do is in any particular situation. This focus shifts the question from “What rule applies?” to “What action most respects persons and promotes their well‑being?” Fletcher presents Situation Ethics as Christian in inspiration, drawing on Jesus’ command to love the neighbour and on passages such as the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37) and Paul’s exposition of love in 1 Corinthians 13.

## Fletcher’s working and fundamental principles
Fletcher organised his theory through a set of working principles and a set of fundamental principles. The working principles are practical guides to how situation decisions should be approached: pragmatism (moral decisions must work toward the good), relativism (rules are not absolute but relative to situations), positivism (the decision to choose love is adopted in faith rather than proved by reason alone), and personalism (people come before rules). Complementing these are the six fundamental propositions that Fletcher offers as axioms: that only love is intrinsically good; that love is the ruling norm of Christian decision-making; that love and justice are the same, since true love seeks fairness; that love is directed to all; that loving ends can justify the means in a specific situation; and that love decides situationally, not prescriptively. Together these principles set out a teleological and consequentialist approach, with agape as the telos.

## Method: how Situation Ethics works in practice
Fletcher’s method is deliberately case-based. A moral agent faced with a dilemma identifies the persons involved, considers the options available, and asks which course of action will achieve the most loving outcome for those persons. Reason and moral imagination are brought to bear, and moral rules are treated as useful guidelines but never as absolute ends. Fletcher is critical of legalism — the view that moral life is simply obedience to rules — because of its potential to produce injustice in particular cases. He is also critical of antinomianism — the idea that there are no moral principles at all — because that leads to chaos. Situation Ethics claims a middle way: it keeps the value of moral principles but subordinates them to the concrete demand of love in a given context. To make this concrete, Fletcher applies his theory to practical cases: lying to a would-be murderer to protect an innocent life can be justified if it is the most loving action; breaking a marital promise might be permitted if continuing it would produce greater harm.

## Teaching examples: homosexuality and polyamory
The WJEC specification specifically lists homosexual and polyamorous relationships as application examples for Situation Ethics, so it is useful to model how Fletcher’s method would handle these issues. With homosexual relationships, a situationist evaluates whether the relationship expresses faithful, mutually respectful love that promotes the well‑being of the partners. If the relationship is genuinely loving and harms no one, situation ethics is likely to judge it morally acceptable because agape is served. The same approach applies to polyamorous relationships: honesty, consent and the welfare of all parties are crucial. If a consensual, transparent arrangement results in loving regard for everyone involved, a situationist might accept it; if it results in deception, exploitation or emotional harm, it would be rejected. The emphasis is always on concrete human flourishing rather than on applying an abstract sexual rule.

## Strengths and contributions
Situation Ethics has several strengths that make it attractive for teaching and contemporary moral thought. Its flexibility allows moral agents to respond compassionately to complex cases where rigid rules would lead to apparent injustice. The theory prioritises persons, which resonates with pastoral and human-centred concerns, and it takes seriously the Christian command to love. Situation Ethics also prompts ethical reflection that is sensitive to context, consequences and relationships, and it appeals to those who find both legalistic systems and bare consequentialism unsatisfactory. In pluralistic societies, its emphasis on love rather than on particular religious rites or creeds can provide common ground between believers and non‑believers when addressing moral problems.

## Criticisms and responses, and the move toward proportionalism
Situation Ethics has faced many criticisms. Opponents argue that its relativism can justify almost anything by appealing to ‘love’ and that it lacks clear decision‑procedures in heated dilemmas. Critics from deontological traditions say it undermines the authority of moral rules and rights, leaving vulnerable people unprotected. There are theological objections too: some claim Fletcher’s agape is vague and departs from biblical teaching when it permits acts that traditional readings would condemn. Philosophers also point out problems in predicting consequences and in defining what ‘the most loving’ outcome is without recourse to other moral goods.

Fletcher and defenders respond by stressing that Situation Ethics is not a licence for whim; it requires serious moral reflection, imagination and the willingness to sacrifice for others. Some later thinkers sought middle solutions. Bernard Hoose and other proportionalists attempted to retain the helpful rule-structure of Natural Law while allowing exceptions where proportionate reasons justify them; proportionalism thus reads as an attempt to combine respect for moral principles with the situational sensitivity Fletcher demanded. Teaching an awareness of these debates helps students to see Situation Ethics as a live moral proposal rather than a simplistic permissive doctrine.

## Relevance today and comparative perspectives
Situation Ethics remains relevant for A-level study because it directly engages issues of conscience, pastoral care and moral reasoning in a way that is readily applied to contemporary dilemmas: biomedical ethics, sexual ethics, and questions arising from multicultural, secular societies. Comparing Situation Ethics with other approaches sharpens understanding: unlike utilitarianism, Fletcher’s account places the person rather than pleasure at centre stage; unlike strict Natural Law, it allows that moral laws can be overridden when love commands otherwise; and unlike emotivism or subjectivism, it upholds an objective standard by treating agape as the intrinsic good. For students, exploring these contrasts reveals deeper questions about moral authority, the role of scripture and the nature of ethical reasoning.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Situation Ethics, start by setting out Fletcher’s position concisely: define agape and explain why Fletcher sees it as the only intrinsic good. Describe the working principles (pragmatism, relativism, positivism, personalism) and the fundamental propositions, making clear how they guide moral choice. Use at least one clear example to show how Situation Ethics operates in practice (for instance, lying to save an innocent person, or the WJEC examples of homosexual and polyamorous relationships). In the evaluation, present balanced criticism: consider both practical criticisms (unpredictability, lack of clear rules) and theological/philosophical objections, and then offer responses or developments (Fletcher’s insistence on serious moral reasoning; proportionalist refinements). Always conclude with a judgement that weighs strengths and weaknesses and links back to the question. Precision with terminology, use of scripture and scholars where appropriate, and a clear structure will help demonstrate AO1 knowledge and AO2 evaluation in line with WJEC expectations.
