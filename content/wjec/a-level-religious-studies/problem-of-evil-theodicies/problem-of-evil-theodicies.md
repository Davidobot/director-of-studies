# Problem of Evil and Theodicies (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## What is the Problem of Evil?
The Problem of Evil asks a straightforward but profound question: if a single God exists who is omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing) and omnibenevolent (all-loving), why does evil and suffering exist in the world? For students it helps to begin by distinguishing moral evil from natural evil. Moral evil is suffering caused by free agents: murder, theft, cruelty or injustice. Natural evil covers suffering that comes from the natural world: earthquakes, disease, storms and congenital disorders. Both types of evil present different challenges for the believer. The problem is not merely theological: it is philosophical and emotional, because it calls into question the nature of God, the meaning of human freedom and the value of life. Examiners expect clear definitions and an awareness that the problem is often expressed in two main forms: the logical problem (suggesting a logical contradiction in the idea of a God who allows evil) and the evidential problem (suggesting that the amount and kind of evil makes God’s existence improbable).

## Logical and evidential formulations
The logical problem of evil is often presented as an inconsistent triad: God is omnipotent; God is omnibenevolent; evil exists. If God is both all-powerful and all-loving, it seems incompatible that evil should exist. Philosophers who press this point argue that if God could prevent evil and wanted to prevent it, evil should not exist; yet it does. The evidential problem takes a weaker but still powerful route: it accepts that logical compatibility might be saved, but stresses that the scale, intensity and apparent gratuitous nature of many evils—such as prolonged animal suffering or large-scale atrocities—make the existence of a loving, powerful God unlikely. Contemporary formulations reference specific examples of apparently pointless suffering and argue that many such cases are strong evidence against the traditional conception of God. For revision, students should be able to explain both versions clearly and to give vivid examples that show why each is troubling for religious belief.

## Augustinian theodicy and its criticisms
One classical religious response is the Augustinian theodicy. St Augustine argued that God created everything good, and that evil is not a substance but a privation of good. Moral evil begins with the misuse of human free will: when created beings turn away from God their actions produce disorder and suffering. Augustine also located the origin of natural evil in the corruption of creation that followed the human fall. This explanation preserves God’s goodness and power by tracing wrongdoing to creaturely choice rather than divine will. However, the Augustinian approach faces several serious criticisms that are useful exam material. Scientific objections point out that the Genesis account does not fit biological and geological evidence for the long, painful history of the natural world; the idea that natural disasters followed the fall seems historically and scientifically implausible. Ethically, critics ask whether an omnipotent God could not have created free beings who always chose the good, or whether a God who is omnibenevolent would allow the inheritance of suffering from primordial events. The Augustinian theodicy therefore faces pressure on both empirical and moral grounds and is best presented in an essay with its strengths acknowledged and its limits exposed.

## Irenaean theodicy and soul-making
A contrasting religious response comes from the Irenaean tradition, developed more recently into what is sometimes called a soul-making theodicy. The basic claim is that humans are created immature and must grow into moral and spiritual maturity; suffering and challenges are necessary for character development. The Irenaean model places emphasis on epistemic distance: God intentionally leaves creatures at some remove so their freedom and moral growth are genuine. The modern version of this view suggests that the world is a “vale of soul-making” in which virtues such as courage, compassion and perseverance can only be formed through trials. This theodicy answers why God might permit suffering in order to create morally mature beings capable of loving relationships with God and others. Criticisms centre on the scale and distribution of suffering. If suffering is meant to promote moral growth, why is it so often uneven, excessive or inflicted on innocent children and animals who cannot learn from it in the required way? There is also tension with justice: should the end of greater goods justify apparently gratuitous pain? Finally, some versions of soul-making imply an eschatological resolution—that God will compensate suffering in an afterlife—which raises further questions about the justice and plausibility of such compensations.

## Free will defences and philosophical refinements
The free will defence is a powerful philosophical move in contemporary discussions. It stresses that moral good—genuine love, moral responsibility and meaningful relationships—requires freedom. If God had created only creatures who always freely chose the good, they would not be truly free. From this perspective the existence of moral evil is the inevitable cost of granting libertarian freedom. Philosophers have refined this idea in several ways to meet the logical problem. One influential approach points out that a possible world in which free agents always freely choose good might not be feasible; there may be “transworld depravity” problems that explain why free agents sometimes go wrong. The distinction between theodicy and defence is also important: a theodicy claims to show that God has morally sufficient reasons for allowing evil; a defence only seeks to show that the existence of God and evil is logically consistent. For examinations, students should be able to explain the free will defence, its strengths in preserving moral agency and autonomy, and its limits—especially in accounting for natural evils that are not obviously linked to human choice.

## Process theodicies and skeptical theism
Two further modern responses take different routes. Process theodicy, originating from process philosophy, rejects classical omnipotence. In this view God is not an absolute controller of every event but a persuasive presence working within a changing world. God is maximally powerful in influencing but not coercively determining creatures, and cannot unilaterally prevent all suffering. This account preserves God’s goodness and allows for genuine creaturely freedom and novelty, but it requires theological revision in the idea of divine power. Skeptical theism, by contrast, keeps classical theism intact but questions our epistemic standing: we should not expect to see God’s reasons for allowing specific evils. Skeptical theists argue that human cognitive limits mean that apparent gratuitous evils could be part of a wider divine plan that we are not in a position to judge. This reply weakens the evidential problem but attracts criticisms that it leads to moral paralysis; if we are not to question God’s reasons, then moral critique of apparently monstrous evils becomes difficult. Examiners expect students to understand both how these responses work and to evaluate whether they succeed in reconciling the reality of suffering with belief in God.

## Responding to the most demanding challenges: the Holocaust, animals and natural disasters
Some of the strongest challenges to theodicies come from extreme historical examples. The Holocaust is frequently discussed because it combines human evil with apparent divine silence; any theodicy that treats suffering as morally educative can seem cruel or insensitive when applied to genocidal suffering. Responses vary: some theologians offer protest theodicies that refuse to provide a justification and instead emphasise lament, solidarity and the limits of human language about God. Other responses appeal to eschatological justice or to the need for human moral agency in preventing evil. Animal suffering presents another puzzle because many animals appear to endure pain with no moral development purpose. Natural disasters—tsunamis, famines and pandemics—raise further questions about the distribution of suffering and whether any theodicy can account for indiscriminate destruction. A sophisticated exam answer recognises the emotional force of these examples, explores different kinds of theodicies, and assesses whether any response is ethically or philosophically satisfying.

## Putting critique and theology together
Good evaluation in this topic moves beyond simply listing objections. Effective answers weigh how different theodicies preserve various attributes of God and what costs they exact. For example, Augustinian responses protect divine omnipotence and goodness but struggle with scientific and moral objections; Irenaean approaches account for moral growth but risk trivialising massive suffering; process theology maintains divine compassion but redefines divine power; skeptical theism protects God’s mystery but can make moral reasoning about evil problematical. Students should also recognise the distinction between the intellectual task of showing consistency and the pastoral task of providing comfort and meaning to sufferers. The biblical book of Job or literary critiques can be used to illustrate that some religious responses focus on protest, endurance and trust rather than on philosophical justification.

## Exam technique
When answering examination questions on the problem of evil, begin with precise definitions and a clear statement of the question’s focus. For short answer questions, state the type of evil (moral or natural), outline the argument or theodicy concisely, and give one evaluative point. For extended essays, allocate time to outline positions (AO1) and to evaluate them (AO2) roughly equally. A strong introduction sets out the structure you will follow. Use named thinkers to demonstrate knowledge—Augustine, Irenaeus, Plantinga, John Hick, process theologians and critics such as Mackie and Rowe—but do not let names replace clear exposition. When evaluating, explain strengths and weaknesses and support critique with concrete examples such as the Holocaust, famine or natural disasters. Always consider counter-replies: after raising an objection to a theodicy, explain how a theodicist might respond and then assess whether that response succeeds. Finish with a balanced conclusion that addresses the question directly and demonstrates insight: you might argue that no single theodicy is fully persuasive but that together they show different ways religious believers can make sense of suffering, or you might take a critical stance that prioritises ethical or evidential arguments. Clarity, structured argument, and careful use of examples win marks.
