# Cosmological and Teleological Arguments (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction
Cosmological and teleological arguments are two of the classic philosophical routes to arguing for the existence of God that you will meet on the WJEC / Eduqas specification. Both types are a posteriori: they begin from experience of the world and infer the existence of a cause, creator or designer. The cosmological argument focuses on contingency, causation or change and asks why there is something rather than nothing. The teleological argument focuses on apparent order, purpose or design in the universe and asks whether the best explanation for that order is an intelligent designer. Exam-style study requires that you can explain the arguments clearly, show how different versions differ, explore objections and then evaluate strengths and weaknesses in the light of modern science and philosophical critique.

## The cosmological argument: basic structure and Aquinas’ Three Ways
At its heart the cosmological argument relies on the intuition that the world does not explain itself and that there must be a sufficient reason for its existence. Thomas Aquinas offered the most famous medieval formulation in his Three Ways. The first way argues from motion or change: things are in motion and anything in motion is moved by something else, and an infinite regress is impossible, so there must be a first unmoved mover. The second way runs from efficient causation: every effect has a cause, there cannot be an endless chain of causes, so there must be a first efficient cause. The third way appeals to contingency: many things exist contingently (they could either exist or not); if everything were contingent there would have been a time when nothing existed, and nothing would have come into existence, so there must be a necessary being whose existence explains the existence of contingent things.

These formulations are tightly linked to medieval metaphysics and assume, for example, that an infinite regress is unacceptable and that causation is a fundamental metaphysical feature. When you write about Aquinas, be ready to explain each way in your own words, show how they differ, and clarify key concepts such as “necessary” versus “contingent” being and the idea of an “uncaused cause” or “first mover.”

## The Kalam cosmological argument and modern formulations
A more recent and influential version is the Kalam cosmological argument. It begins with two premises: whatever begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist; therefore the universe has a cause. Contemporary defenders refine the second premise by appealing to cosmology (the Big Bang) and philosophical arguments against the possibility of an actual infinite series of past events. The conclusion is typically that the cause of the universe must be timeless, spaceless and powerful, which many proponents identify with God.

This modern form brings scientific evidence into the debate and introduces new philosophical issues: what does it mean for the universe to "begin to exist"? How firm is the scientific case for a temporal beginning? How convincing are arguments against actual infinities? As a student, distinguish carefully the different steps: the metaphysical principle that "begins to exist implies a cause," the cosmological claim about the universe's origin, and the inference from "a cause" to "a personal, transcendent creator." Each step can be challenged, and exam answers should show awareness of possible objections as well as how proponents respond.

## The teleological argument: Paley, Aquinas’ Fifth Way and the argument from fine-tuning
The teleological argument argues from order, purpose or apparent design in nature to the existence of an intelligent designer. William Paley’s famous watchmaker analogy invites readers to imagine finding a watch on a heath: its intricate, purpose-like arrangement of parts clearly points to a designer. Paley then extends the analogy to living organisms and the natural world. Aquinas’ Fifth Way also appeals to apparent order: natural bodies act towards an end and therefore must be guided by an intelligent being.

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries the teleological argument has been developed in new ways. The “anthropic” or “fine-tuning” arguments note that physical constants and initial conditions appear to fall within a narrow range that permits life. Proponents argue that such precise calibration is unlikely to be due to chance, and so the best explanation is that the universe is designed to support life. These arguments often stand alongside discussions of the multiverse, probabilistic reasoning and the limits of analogy between human artifacts and cosmic processes.

When explaining teleological arguments in an exam, clarify whether the claim is analogical (like Paley), probabilistic (fine-tuning), or teleonomic (apparent purpose arising from natural processes), and be precise about what is being claimed: not simply complexity, but complexity that appears to be functionally specified or law-like.

## Main criticisms and alternatives: Hume, Darwin and the multiverse
Both cosmological and teleological arguments face serious objections. David Hume famously critiqued design arguments by questioning the strength of analogical reasoning: objects in the world are not sufficiently like human artifacts to justify inferring a human-like designer, and even if a designer is inferred the designer need not be the God of classical theism. Hume also allowed for the possibility of multiple designers or an imperfect creator. For cosmological arguments, critics challenge the move from "first cause" to "God" and question whether the principle that everything must have a cause is consistently applied when it comes to the first cause.

Biological evolution by natural selection is the most important scientific challenge to Paley-style arguments. Darwin showed how apparent design in living organisms can arise without recourse to an intelligent designer. In teleological debates today, many students must evaluate whether natural selection fully answers the appearance of design or whether it leaves the fine-tuning problem untouched because fine-tuning concerns physical constants rather than biological complexity.

The multiverse hypothesis has emerged as a scientific alternative to design in fine-tuning discussions: if there are many universes with varying constants, it is not surprising that at least one should permit life. This shifts the conversation to probabilistic reasoning and the plausibility of multiverse proposals. In exams, you should balance the force of scientific challenges with philosophical scrutiny of the assumptions those challenges rely upon.

## Contemporary defences and philosophical refinements
Defenders of cosmological and teleological arguments have refined their positions in response to modern objections. Some cosmological defenders appeal to modal logic and metaphysical distinctions between contingent and necessary beings: the claim becomes not merely that there is a first cause, but that there must exist a necessary being whose non-existence is impossible. Others stress personal causation: the causal explanation for the universe is offered as a personal agent because only a personal agent can cause a temporal effect without itself being temporally caused.

On the teleological side, the modern “fine-tuning” argument does not rest on biological complexity but on precise physical parameters. Proponents argue that the best inference to the best explanation for this deep regularity is design. They engage with the multiverse by questioning its empirical basis and probabilistic claims. Some philosophers also develop cosmological and teleological claims together: if the universe requires a sustaining cause and exhibits fine-tuning, a single explanatory hypothesis—an intelligent, necessary creator—may have explanatory advantages.

In your essays, identify how these contemporary moves try to avoid older weaknesses. Show awareness that many debates now revolve around methodology and probability rather than the original metaphysical intuitions alone. Be ready to explain “inference to the best explanation,” the modal vocabulary of necessity and contingency, and how scientific evidence is interwoven with philosophical premises.

## Weighing strengths and weaknesses
When evaluating these arguments, plan to weigh conceptual clarity, evidential support, and philosophical coherence. Strengths often cited include the intuitive appeal of causal explanation, the way cosmological reasoning respects principles of sufficient reason, and the emotional and existential resonance of design interpretations. Weaknesses include reliance on contentious metaphysical premises (for example, the impossibility of infinite regress), potential special pleading when the first cause is exempted from the causal principle, limits of analogical reasoning, and the degree to which scientific accounts provide alternative explanations.

Good evaluation balances sympathy for both sides. For instance, acknowledge that cosmology and physics have made the universe’s origin a scientifically live issue, and that teleological discussions continue to engage with real empirical facts about the universe. At the same time, explain why philosophical objections—such as the problem of induction, the challenge of moving from “cause” to a particular transcendent personal being, or the difficulty of turning improbability into proof—remain significant.

## Exam technique
Begin every answer with a clear definition and map of your argument: state what the cosmological or teleological claim is, identify the variant you will explain, and outline the plan for analysis and evaluation. Use precise terminology—contingent, necessary, efficient cause, analogy, inductive, a posteriori—and demonstrate understanding by unpacking these terms in your own words. When explaining a philosopher’s view (Aquinas, Kalam, Paley, Hume, Darwin, modern defenders), summarise the argument in a short paragraph before moving to critique.

For evaluation, alternate description with analysis: after you explain a premise, follow immediately with a potential objection and the best reply. Examiners reward engagement with both sides and the ability to weigh competing arguments. Use relevant contemporary examples—for instance, the Big Bang as evidence concerning beginnings, Darwinian evolution when discussing biological design, and the fine-tuning of physical constants—to show you can connect philosophical claims to scientific background. Remember to clarify when an objection attacks a premise rather than the conclusion, and to consider strengths of responses such as modal reformulations or probabilistic reasoning.

Manage your time by allocating minutes according to the mark scheme, leaving at least five minutes to write a clear conclusion that assesses how persuasive you find the argument overall. A strong conclusion does more than summarise: it states a reasoned judgment that reflects the evidence and objections you have discussed. Finally, write accurately, use specialist vocabulary appropriately, and where appropriate signal synoptic links to ethics or other areas of the specification to demonstrate wider understanding.
