# Scripture, Canon and Biblical Criticism (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## What this topic covers and why it matters
This topic examines how the books of the Bible came to be written, selected and used; how scholars study and test those texts; and how different approaches to scripture affect belief and practice. At A level you need to be confident in describing the historical processes that produced the biblical canon, the variety of literary genres found in Scripture, and the methods scholars use to investigate authorship, date, provenance and meaning. You will also be expected to evaluate arguments from different schools of thought: for example, traditional claims about divine inspiration and historical reliability versus modern critical accounts that treat biblical texts as products of particular communities and times. Understanding these debates is crucial because they shape theology, worship, ethics and the ways communities use scripture in public life.

## Formation of the canon and the status of Scripture
The biblical canon was not fixed instantly; it emerged through a process of selection, debate and authority-claim across centuries. For the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) different Jewish communities gradually recognised a core of sacred writings, with debates about some books continuing into the early Common Era. The Christian New Testament took shape in the first few centuries after Jesus, as churches relied on letters, gospels and other writings for teaching and liturgy. Councils, pastoral needs, apostolic attribution and widespread usage all influenced which books were accepted. Canon formation raises key questions: why certain writings were privileged, what criteria were employed (apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity), and how liturgical use helped fix authority. The status of scripture also varies between traditions: some read texts as inerrant and verbally inspired, others as divinely engaged yet culturally conditioned. In practice, how communities treat books—whether they are read aloud, memorised, interpreted allegorically or literally—shapes religious identity.

## Textual transmission and textual criticism
Before considering meaning, scholars look at how texts have been transmitted. Manuscripts show variants introduced by copyists, deliberate edits, or accidental changes. Textual criticism aims to reconstruct the earliest attainable text by comparing manuscript families, analysing scribal habits and weighing external and internal evidence. Famous textual issues include the longer ending of Mark and the pericope adulterae (John 7:53–8:11), where some early manuscripts lack verses later familiar to many readers. Textual critics explain why such passages might have been added or altered, and how that affects interpretation. This discipline matters for A-level students because it grounds claims about authorial intention and historical reliability: recognising variant readings helps you evaluate arguments about what the original authors actually wrote.

## Literary forms and methods of biblical criticism
Biblical studies uses a range of literary-critical and historical methods to tease apart composition and meaning. Source criticism asks whether a text is a composite of earlier documents; the synoptic problem and the hypothesised Q source are classic examples asking how Matthew, Mark and Luke are related. Form criticism analyses shorter units—parables, miracle stories, hymns—and seeks to identify their original social setting (Sitz im Leben) and function within early communities. Redaction criticism examines how editors shaped traditions to convey theological aims; for instance, comparing how different Gospel writers arrange episodes can reveal distinctive theological emphases. Historical-critical approaches aim to situate texts within their first-century contexts and to test historical claims about Jesus and the early church. Each method has strengths and limits: source criticism highlights literary dependence but can be speculative; form criticism is sensitive to oral tradition but may reconstruct social settings with uncertainty; redaction criticism reveals theological shaping but must avoid assuming malice or deceit by editors.

## Case studies: Gospel narratives, parables and miracles
Applying methods to concrete texts is essential. The birth narratives and resurrection stories provide fertile ground for analysis. The infancy accounts in Matthew and Luke differ in detail and theology; redaction and source criticism point to different community concerns behind each narrative, and harmonisation attempts reflect later theological priorities such as the doctrine of incarnation. The resurrection invites historical-critical debate: some scholars treat the empty tomb and post-mortem appearances as events open to historical scrutiny; others characterise resurrection as a theological claim about God’s action that exceeds purely historical categories. Parables and miracle stories require attention to genre. Parables work rhetorically: form criticism identifies types (example parables, riddle parables) and redaction criticism shows how each evangelist uses them. Miracle accounts raise textual and philosophical issues: are they best read as literal signs of divine intervention, as theological narrative to express Jesus’ authority, or as symbolic stories teaching about the kingdom? Mentioning contrasting scholars—such as those who read Jesus primarily as an apocalyptic prophet and those who stress his socio-religious teaching—helps structure balanced evaluation in essays.

## Historical Jesus scholarship and major debates
Modern scholarship distinguishes between the historical Jesus and the Christ of faith. Methods include criteria of authenticity (multiple attestation, embarrassment, dissimilarity) and contextual reading within first-century Judaism. Scholars like John Dominic Crossan emphasise the social-historical Jesus, often highlighting revolutionary or peasant contexts; others, like N. T. Wright, argue for a picture of Jesus as the messianic figure rooted in Jewish hope and whose resurrection should be taken as a historical event tied to God’s covenantal action. Debates also concern Pauline letters: some letters in Paul’s name are widely accepted as genuine while others are contested or considered pseudonymous. Questions of authorship, dating and community context shape how we interpret doctrine and practice attributed to Paul. For exam answers it is valuable to name positions, explain methods used to arrive at them, and then assess their plausibility by reference to manuscript evidence, early reception, and internal coherence.

## Interpretation, authority and contemporary application
Interpretive approaches influence ethical and doctrinal conclusions. Literalist readings often prioritise direct, prescriptive meanings and may stress textual inerrancy. Historical-critical and literary approaches encourage reading with awareness of culture and genre, allowing for development in doctrine and ethics over time. Theological readings may combine historical inquiry with confessional commitments, while narrative and reader-response approaches focus on how communities and readers create meaning. All approaches face challenges: literalism can be insensitive to genre and historical context; purely critical readings can be accused of undermining faith; constructive theological readings must justify how tradition and reason interact with historical knowledge. In contemporary contexts, scripture influences debates about social issues, law and identity; exam answers should show awareness of how methods of interpretation produce different moral and social outcomes and how communities negotiate pluralism and secular critique.

## How to use scholars and evidence in essays
High-quality answers pair clear factual knowledge with critical engagement. When you introduce a scholarly view, briefly summarise the method they use and the evidence they rely upon. For example, explain that Bultmann used form criticism to distinguish the kerygma from mythic elements and sought to “demythologise” texts, whereas N. T. Wright employs historical contextualisation and argues for the plausibility of the resurrection within first-century Jewish expectations. Use manuscript examples when discussing textual criticism, and refer to particular passages when analysing interpretation (for instance, the differing infancy narratives or the longer ending of Mark). Evaluation should consider methodological strengths and weaknesses, such as whether a reconstruction relies on speculative sources, whether it accounts for early reception, and whether it coherently connects literary features with historical context. Always aim for balance: present the strongest case for each view and then weigh the evidence.

## Exam technique
Begin each essay by defining key terms and setting out the precise question you will answer. Use the first paragraph to map your plan so the examiner can follow your line of argument. For AO1 (knowledge and understanding) provide accurate descriptions of processes, methods and texts: explain what the canon is, outline how it formed, define methods like textual criticism, source criticism, form and redaction criticism, and give concrete examples from the Bible to illustrate each point. For AO2 (analysis and evaluation) move beyond description to compare arguments, weigh evidence and judge plausibility. Structure longer answers into clear sections: an initial definition and signposting, a descriptive section showing secure factual knowledge, an analytical section contrasting viewpoints and exploring implications, and a concise conclusion that answers the question directly and justifies your judgment.

When writing, integrate scholars and textual evidence naturally: present a scholar’s view, support or challenge it with manuscript or textual detail, and then evaluate its strengths and limitations. Avoid asserting opinions without support. Time management matters: in a 45‑minute essay allocate time to plan, write and proofread; in shorter source-based questions give priority to accurate reading of the passage before linking it to wider debates. Use specialist vocabulary correctly but do not overuse jargon. Finally, always end with a clear conclusion that summarises the argument and makes a reasoned judgment, showing the examiner that you can move from knowledge to critical assessment — the skill that both AO1 and AO2 require.
