# Aquinas' Natural Law (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview
Aquinas’ Natural Law is one of the most influential ethical theories in Western thought and an essential topic on the WJEC/Eduqas specification. It presents morality as grounded in a rational order built into creation by God. For Aquinas, right action flows from the way human beings are made and the purposes for which they were created. Natural Law therefore combines philosophical reasoning about human nature with a theological belief in a creator. In A-level terms you should be able to explain Aquinas’ basic concepts clearly (AO1) and then assess their strengths and weaknesses, using examples and alternative viewpoints (AO2). Natural Law is often described as a deontological system because it produces moral rules (precepts) but it also has teleological elements because it appeals to human purposes or ends (telos).

## Historical and philosophical context
Thomas Aquinas lived in the thirteenth century and worked in a medieval intellectual world that was absorbing Aristotle’s philosophy together with Christian theology. Aquinas famously adapted Aristotelian concepts—especially the idea that everything has a purpose—to Christian doctrine. He sought to show that reason and faith are complementary: reason can discover truths about the natural order while revelation (divine law) completes and corrects human understanding. That synthesis is important for exam answers: Aquinas is not simply a rationalist or simply a theologian; his Natural Law sits at the intersection of both. Later thinkers have adapted or criticised his approach, but the original Aquinian framework remains central to many religious ethical positions, especially within Roman Catholic thought.

## The fourfold structure of law
Aquinas distinguishes four kinds of law which help to explain how moral principles are grounded and applied. Eternal law is the divine wisdom of God ordering all things; it is the source of all other law. Divine law is the revelation given in scripture and tradition that guides human beings toward their supernatural end. Natural law is a participation by rational creatures in the eternal law: human reason reflects aspects of God’s ordering and discovers basic moral principles. Human law is the set of practical rules and legal codes created by communities to organise life; proper human law should be rooted in natural law. In exam answers, demonstrating how these four relate—particularly how natural law is a middle term between eternal and human law—shows good understanding. You can illustrate the point by explaining how a civil law against murder reflects the primary natural precept to preserve life; if a human law contradicts natural law, Aquinas would say it lacks proper moral authority.

## Primary precepts, secondary precepts and real versus apparent goods
At the heart of Aquinas’ Natural Law are the primary precepts: basic goods that humans can know through reason and that orient us toward our flourishing. Aquinas lists central ends such as the preservation of life, reproduction (the continuation of the species), education of offspring, living in society (ordered community), and the worship of God. From these primary precepts follow secondary precepts, which are more specific moral rules derived by reasoning about particular situations. Secondary precepts can be numerous and culturally varied because they depend on human practical reasoning. Aquinas also distinguishes between real goods—those that truly fulfil human nature and lead to flourishing—and apparent goods—choices that seem good but actually frustrate human purpose. A useful exam example is temperance: the primary precept of preserving life leads to the secondary rule ‘do not consume harmful substances’; pursuing what appears pleasurable (an apparent good) can be judged wrong because it undermines real goods.

## Reason, telos and the role of virtues
Aquinas places great weight on practical reason. Moral agents use reason to identify human purposes (telos) and to work out how to act in particular circumstances. The ultimate telos for humans in Aquinas is union with God (beatitude), and natural law orients people toward ends compatible with that final goal. Virtue theory plays an important supporting role in Natural Law: Aquinas integrates the four cardinal virtues—prudence, justice, temperance and fortitude—with the three theological virtues of faith, hope and charity. Prudence, in particular, is central because it governs practical reasoning and allows a person to choose the mean between extremes. When answering evaluation questions, explain how the virtues help agents to act in accordance with natural law and why Aquinas sees moral education and habit as necessary for moral behaviour.

## Moral decision-making and the Doctrine of Double Effect
Aquinas’ account of moral action attends both to intention and consequences. The Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE), which draws on Aquinian thinking, is crucial to understanding how Natural Law handles complex cases. The DDE allows an action that has a bad side-effect if the bad effect is not intended, only foreseen; the action itself must be morally good or neutral, the bad effect cannot be the means to the good effect, and there must be a proportionately grave reason for allowing the bad side-effect. Classic applied examples help to make the theory concrete and exam-ready. In the case of an ectopic pregnancy, for instance, removing the damaged fallopian tube (which foreseeably ends the embryo’s life) can be justified under DDE because the primary intention is to save the mother’s life, not to kill. In end-of-life care, giving strong pain relief that may shorten life can be permitted if the intention is pain relief and not death. By contrast, direct killing to hasten death would breach the primary precept to preserve life. Use these examples to show both how Natural Law works in practice and where debates arise.

## Strengths and criticisms
Natural Law has notable strengths: it offers an objective, universal moral framework grounded in human nature; it connects ethics to a coherent teleological anthropology; it provides clear, principled guidance that can be applied to laws and policy; and it integrates virtues and character formation. It also supports social stability by valuing ordered community and the common good. However, there are important criticisms you should be ready to discuss. Critics argue that Aquinas’ reliance on a divinely ordered natural order makes Natural Law less persuasive to secular audiences who reject theological premises. Some claim the theory depends on contested metaphysical claims about human nature and purpose, and that changes in science and culture challenge Aquinas’ biological assumptions. The so-called naturalistic fallacy is another critique: deriving ‘ought’ from ‘is’ can be philosophically problematic if empirical facts about nature do not straightforwardly yield moral rules. Practical critics point to the rigidity of some natural law applications, where secondary precepts are treated as absolute without sufficient attention to context. Modern moral philosophers and theologians have revised Aquinas’ ideas: figures such as John Finnis reformulated Natural Law in a non-theistic way by focusing on basic human goods and practical reason, while proportionalists and critics have argued for greater flexibility when values conflict. In evaluation, balance Aquinas’ enduring resources with these contemporary challenges and show how Natural Law can be both defended and adapted.

## Application: abortion and euthanasia
Natural Law’s approach to issues such as abortion and voluntary euthanasia is a regular exam theme. Applying Aquinas requires you to start from primary precepts and consider intention, means and consequences. On abortion, Aquinas would typically see direct abortion as wrong because it intentionally destroys an innocent human life and thus violates the primary precept of preserving life and the good of reproduction. Where dilemmas arise—such as maternal life being at risk—Aquinasian reasoning using DDE may allow certain medical procedures that unintentionally result in fetal death if the primary aim is to save the mother. In euthanasia, Natural Law is generally opposed because intentional killing contradicts the preservation of life; providing palliative care that may incidentally hasten death can be permitted if the intention is pain relief and not death. For exam answers, show clear AO1 description of the reasoning and then AO2 evaluation: consider counterarguments from consequentialist perspectives, contemporary medical facts, and the question of whether intention vs. foresight is a morally stable distinction.

## Exam technique
When answering WJEC/Eduqas questions on Natural Law, aim for a clear structure that addresses both AO1 (knowledge) and AO2 (analysis/evaluation). For a 20–25 mark question, begin with a concise introduction that defines Natural Law and locates Aquinas’ position. Use the middle section to explain key ideas: the four kinds of law, primary and secondary precepts, the role of reason and telos, virtues, and the Doctrine of Double Effect. Ground explanations in short examples (for instance, an ectopic pregnancy or pain relief at the end of life) to show application. For evaluation, present at least two substantive criticisms—philosophical (naturalistic fallacy, reliance on theological premises), practical (cultural change, rigidity), and modern developments (Finnis, proportionalism). Also offer possible defenses or adaptations: appeal to practical reason, the flexibility of secondary precepts, or contemporary reinterpretations that drop theological language. Conclude with a balanced judgement that answers the question directly, weighs the arguments and signals the extent to which Aquinas’ Natural Law remains persuasive for different audiences. Manage your time so you leave a short conclusion and ensure you use specialist terms (telos, primary precepts, Doctrine of Double Effect, cardinal and theological virtues) accurately; examiners reward accurate terminology and clear application to issues.
