# Religious Experience and Mysticism (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## What we mean by religious experience and mysticism
Religious experience is any event or series of events in which an individual or group reports contact with, awareness of, or transformation by what they take to be a divine, numinous or ultimate reality. Mysticism is a subset of religious experience emphasising a direct, often transformative encounter with the ultimate; mystics typically describe union, insight into ultimate truths, or an overwhelming sense of the sacred that goes beyond ordinary language. Both concepts are central to the philosophy of religion and to the study of religion because they raise questions about the sources of religious authority, the nature of religious knowledge and the ways personal encounters shape communal belief. In the WJEC/Eduqas specification these topics appear in AS Unit 2 (religious experience, part 1) and in A‑level Unit 5 (religious experience, part 2), so answers should show knowledge of classroom definitions and engagement with scholars and critiques.

## Types and features of religious experience
Religious experiences come in many forms: sensory visions in which individuals claim to see spiritual beings or scenes; intellectual illuminations that convey new understanding; conversion experiences that reorient life and belief; mystical experiences that are transcendent, unitive or ecstatic; and answers to prayer or felt presences in worship. Classic characteristics of mystical experience, as set out by William James, are that they are ineffable (beyond adequate description), noetic (conveying insight), transient (temporary in duration) and passive (the subject is acted upon). Rudolf Otto’s account complements this by emphasising the numinous dimension: encounters that evoke mysterium tremendum et fascinans, a mixture of awe, dread and attraction that points to a wholly other reality. Teresa of Avila, writing from within a Christian mystical tradition, describes stages in contemplative prayer that move from active, discursive prayer to passive union with God; her accounts are useful for understanding the interior structure and ethical effects of mystical states.

## Religious experience across traditions: examples and functions
Religious experience is not confined to one faith. In Christianity, conversion narratives such as Paul’s Damascus road experience function historically and theologically as turning points for individuals and communities. Christian mystics such as Julian of Norwich and Teresa of Avila have exercised long‑term influence by articulating inward encounters with God that shaped doctrine and devotional practice. In Islam, Muhammad’s Night of Power and subsequent revelations are paradigmatic, establishing the Qur’an’s authority and shaping communal norms; Sufi traditions emphasise ecstatic union and practices such as dhikr to cultivate intimate awareness of God. In Buddhism, the Buddha’s awakening under the Bodhi tree is presented as an experiential discovery of the nature of suffering and the path to its cessation rather than theistic encounter; in some Mahayana and Vajrayana contexts, mystical practices such as meditation and mantra aim at direct insight or compassionate union. Across traditions religious experiences often serve to confirm belief, energise movements, inspire ethical reform, and provide communities with vivid narratives that shape identity and practice.

## Philosophical and theological accounts: James, Otto, Swinburne and others
Philosophers of religion have offered different tools to analyse religious experience. William James treats mystical states as psychologically real and epistemically valuable for the person who has them: they convey religious knowledge even if private. Rudolf Otto’s account stresses the pre‑rational encounter with the numinous as basic to religious feeling. In the analytic tradition, Richard Swinburne offers a more evidential defence: his “principle of credulity” and “principle of testimony” suggest we should generally trust people’s experiences unless we have reason not to, and he argues that reports of miracles and religious encounters can be treated like other historical testimonies. These positive accounts are often paired with theological uses of experience: experiences can be read as confirmation of scripture, motive for worship, or evidence for doctrines such as providence or revelation. When using these scholars in exam answers, explain their claims clearly and show how they bear on the question posed.

## Challenges and explanations: psychological, neuroscientific and epistemological critiques
Religious experiences are contested. Caroline Franks Davis frames challenges under three headings. Description‑related challenges point out how experiences can be misdescribed or misinterpreted; subject‑related challenges focus on psychological states, mental illness, drugs or neurological conditions that may produce religious‑like experiences; object‑related challenges question whether the object of the experience corresponds to anything external. Sigmund Freud and some reductionist accounts depict religion as wish fulfilment or neurosis, while occupational neuroscience identifies temporal lobe seizures and certain brain states that correlate with mystical experiences. Philosophical critics press epistemological objections: private, non‑repeatable experiences are hard to verify and therefore provide weak grounds for universal religious claims. Defenders respond by noting that many basic beliefs, including historical and empirical claims, rest on testimony and memory; moreover, the transformative and morally beneficial effects of experience can lend them credibility. In essays students should weigh these competing claims, showing both the force of naturalistic explanations and the limits of reductionism.

## Miracles, verification and the impact on religious language
Miracles are a special class of religiously significant events often reported as disruptions of the natural order or as divine interventions. David Hume famously argued that testimony for miracles will always be defeated by the improbability of violating natural laws, and that human credulity makes miraculous reports unreliable. Richard Swinburne counters Hume by refining definitions of miracle and by noting methodological considerations for historical testimony. Debates about religious experience and miracles intersect with issues in religious language. Logical Positivists claimed that religious statements are meaningless because they are not empirically verifiable, while later thinkers developed falsification, symbolist and language‑game responses. If religious claims are taken as describing experiences or realities directly apprehended by a subject, then questions of verification and intersubjective testability matter; if they are symbolic, analogical or part of a religious language game, their meaning is understood differently. Good answers will connect how theories of language shape how we treat reports of mystical experience and miracles: are these claims cognitive descriptions of reality, moral exhortations, symbolic narratives or expressions of a life‑form?

## Evaluating religious experience as evidence for religious belief
When assessing whether religious experiences provide adequate evidence for belief, students should combine careful AO1 (knowledge) with sustained AO2 (analysis and evaluation). Begin by clarifying the type of experience under consideration and the claims made on its behalf. Present supporting arguments such as James’s noetic value and Swinburne’s testimony principle, then give balanced engagement with challenges from Franks Davis, Hume, and scientific accounts. Consider pragmatic and communal dimensions: even if an experience is not conclusive proof of a universal metaphysical reality, it can have real epistemic significance for individuals and communities by shaping moral outlooks, religious practices and institutions. A persuasive evaluation recognises the strengths of experiential testimony while acknowledging limits of intersubjective verification and the dangers of unchecked subjectivity.

## Exam technique
In examinations, demonstrate first‑rate AO1 by defining key terms such as religious experience, mysticism, numinous, conversion and miracle, and by referring to named thinkers—James, Otto, Teresa of Avila, Franks Davis, Hume and Swinburne—accurately and succinctly. Show full command of the specification content by linking your discussion to both Part 1 and Part 2 treatment of religious experience in the WJEC/Eduqas course: for example, explain William James and Otto in AS Unit 2 contexts and develop the debate with Hume and Swinburne at A‑level Unit 5. For AO2, organise your answer into a clear argumentative structure: a brief introduction defining scope, development where each paragraph takes a claim and a counterclaim, and a conclusion that weighs the evidence and reaches a reasoned judgement. Use concrete examples from different religious traditions to illustrate points—Paul’s conversion, Muhammad’s Night of Power, the Buddha’s awakening, Sufi mystical poetry or Teresa’s inner writings—and explain how these examples support or challenge theoretical positions. Always evaluate sources of authority: consider the significance of personal verification versus communal validation, the role of scripture and tradition, and the impact of naturalistic explanations. Engage with language issues where relevant: explain how taking religious reports as symbolic or as part of a Wittgensteinian language game changes how we assess their truth. Finally, ensure clarity and precision in expression, deploy specialist vocabulary appropriately, and make explicit links between claims, evidence and counter‑evidence to meet the assessment objectives for high marks.
