# Divine Command Theory (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## What is Divine Command Theory?
Divine Command Theory (DCT) is a meta‑ethical view which locates the grounding of moral rightness and wrongness in the will or commands of God. According to DCT, moral statements such as "murder is wrong" are true because God forbids murder; to act morally is to obey God's commands. The theory seeks to provide an objective foundation for ethics by identifying moral authority with a transcendent source, so that moral obligations are not merely human conventions but follow from the nature or decrees of a divine being. In the context of A‑level study, DCT is encountered as a religious approach to ethics and appears alongside other ethical theories such as Natural Law, Situation Ethics and Utilitarianism. It raises questions about the status of moral language, the source of moral obligation and the role of revelation and conscience in moral knowledge.

## Historical background and context
The issues DCT addresses are very old. Plato’s Euthyphro dialogue records one of the earliest and most influential philosophical challenges to the idea that morality simply tracks divine command: does God command something because it is good, or is it good because God commands it? In the history of theology and philosophy many religious traditions have, however, treated the divine as the ultimate moral authority. Within Christian thought there are different emphases: some medieval and scholastic writers treated God's will as decisive, while others, such as Thomas Aquinas, argued for a natural moral order discoverable by reason that reflects God’s eternal law. In modern philosophical debate DCT has been defended, revised and attacked by analytic philosophers and theologians seeking to clarify how divine authority can plausibly ground moral objectivity without reducing morality to arbitrary divine whims.

## Robert Adams and Modified Divine Command Theory
One of the most important contemporary developments is Robert Adams’ Modified Divine Command Theory. Adams accepts the core intuition that moral obligations are rooted in God, but he seeks to avoid the charge that DCT makes morality arbitrary. Adams argues that moral obligations consist in the commands of a loving, morally perfect God; because God's nature is essentially loving, God would not issue commands that are malevolent or capricious. On this view, something is right because it is commanded by God, but the commands that God issues are constrained by the divine nature. Adams’ approach makes DCT compatible with the idea that morals are objective and non‑arbitrary: the bindingness of moral rules derives from God's essential character rather than mere fiat. This move reshapes the standard Euthyphro challenge into a subtler debate about whether grounding morality in God’s nature is philosophically satisfactory and whether that account can be made coherent.

## Main criticisms of Divine Command Theory
DCT attracts a number of classic objections that are useful to learn for examination. The Euthyphro dilemma, as noted, asks whether the goodness of actions is independent of God (in which case God is not the source of morality) or whether goodness is simply what God commands (which seems to make morality arbitrary). The arbitrariness objection highlights the worry that if moral rightness is just what God wills, then any action could be declared right by divine decree — seemingly including actions we ordinarily judge monstrous. A related concern is the problem of moral epistemology: even if morality ultimately depends on God, how are we to know God’s commands? Reliance upon sacred texts, prophetic teaching and religious institutions raises questions about conflicting interpretations and the role of conscience and reason. Religious pluralism compounds these worries: different faiths claim different divine commands, so DCT appears to yield incompatible moral directives. Finally, secular critics argue that DCT cannot justify moral obligations for non‑believers and thus struggles to provide a universally acceptable ethical foundation in a religiously diverse society.

## Responses and defenses
Defenders of DCT have developed a number of strategies to meet these criticisms. Adams’ move to tie commands to God’s essentially good nature is the most prominent reply to arbitrariness: God cannot will the morally abhorrent because God’s character is essentially loving and just. Some theists respond to the Euthyphro dilemma by arguing that the dilemma presupposes a false dichotomy; they claim the best account is that moral truths reflect God’s nature — so moral standards are neither independent of God nor arbitrary. On the epistemological front, theologians and philosophers appeal to a combination of sources: scripture, tradition and reason, with conscience playing a regulative role. The pluralism objection is addressed in different ways depending on theological commitments. Exclusive theists may contend that apparent conflicts are due to misinterpretation, corruption of texts or cultural accretions, and so maintain that a correct understanding of the divine will would resolve contradiction. Others accept some diversity and appeal to principles of interpretation, moral consensus or natural law overlap as ways in which different religious moralities can converge on common moral truths. Some defenders also argue that DCT can coexist with moral reasoning: knowing what God commands often requires moral deliberation, so obedience and moral reflection are not opposed.

## Implications and application
Understanding DCT helps when considering how religious morality functions in practice. If moral duty is defined as obedience to divine command, religious texts and authorities acquire central importance for ethical decision making. This has real effects on public ethics, law and personal conscience: scriptural pronouncements and religious traditions can shape views on issues such as sexual ethics, bioethics, and social justice. A DCT framework readily explains why believers often treat certain actions as obligatory irrespective of consequences and why moral duties have a binding, ultimate authority. It also raises pressing ethical questions in plural societies: how should public policy be formed when citizens accept different divine authorities? In applied examination questions, DCT should be contrasted with Natural Law, which appeals to human reason and an objective natural order, and with consequentialist or virtue‑based approaches. Good answers show how DCT handles particular case studies — for example, whether a doctor should obey a divine command forbidding a form of treatment, or how a community decides on moral norms when scriptures appear to conflict with contemporary human rights.

## Evaluative balance
When evaluating DCT, it is important to weigh strengths against weaknesses in a balanced way. Strengths include providing a robust account of moral authority and motivation for believers, offering objective moral grounding and connecting ethics to a coherent theistic worldview. The theory can explain why moral obligations are binding and why certain moral duties seem absolute. Weaknesses include the Euthyphro problem, tensions around moral arbitrariness unless modified, difficulties of moral epistemology and problems of pluralism and secular applicability. The success of modern modifications, such as Adams’, depends on whether students find the idea of grounding morality in the divine nature philosophically persuasive and whether they think such grounding secures moral objectivity without collapsing into arbitrariness. A strong exam answer assesses these moves critically and recognises that the plausibility of DCT often rests on theological assumptions about God’s nature that will not convince secular interlocutors.

## Exam technique
In essays on Divine Command Theory you should begin with a clear definition and immediate placement of DCT within the A‑level specification’s framework — it is a religious approach to ethics and a meta‑ethical claim about the grounding of moral values. Show AO1 knowledge by explaining the classic Euthyphro dilemma and the arbitrariness and pluralism objections, and name key defenders such as Robert Adams while summarising his Modified Divine Command Theory in clear terms. For AO2 evaluation, do not simply list objections; explore responses in detail and weigh their success. Use concrete examples to illustrate points, such as hypothetical divine commands that clash with ordinary moral intuition, and consider how Adams’ appeal to God’s essential goodness would handle that case. When comparing with other theories, highlight contrasts with Natural Law (reason‑based objectivity) and Utilitarianism (consequence‑based ethics), showing how DCT produces different verdicts in moral dilemmas. Structure your answer so that each paragraph has a clear point, explanation and evaluation, and finish with a reasoned judgement that addresses the question set rather than offering a generic conclusion. Allocate time to plan: a short plan saves time later and ensures you hit both AO1 and AO2. Make sure to use specialist vocabulary precisely — terms such as meta‑ethics, omnibenevolence, moral objectivity, divine fiat, and epistemology — and, where appropriate, bring in synoptic links to philosophy of religion and applied ethics to maximise marks.
