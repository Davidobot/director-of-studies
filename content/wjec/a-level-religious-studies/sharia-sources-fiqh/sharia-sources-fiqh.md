# Shari'a: Sources and Fiqh (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

Shari'a and fiqh form the heart of Islamic law and ethical reasoning. Shari'a is best understood as the divine way or path revealed by God: a moral and legal ideal that expresses what Islam teaches about human duties, worship and social justice. Fiqh, by contrast, is the human endeavour to understand, interpret and apply Shari'a. Fiqh is therefore fallible and historically situated; it grows through juristic reasoning, debate and the decisions of scholars. For A-level study you must be able to explain this distinction clearly, show how rulings are reached, and evaluate both classical methods and modern responses to new problems.

## Primary sources: Qur'an and Sunnah

The two foundational sources for Shari'a are the Qur'an and the Sunnah. The Qur'an is regarded by Muslims as the verbatim word of God delivered to Muhammad and therefore has supreme authority. It contains direct commandments, narratives, legal principles and moral guidance. The Sunnah comprises the sayings, actions and tacit approvals of the Prophet recorded in hadith literature and functions as the primary human explanation and embodiment of Qur'anic teaching. Understanding how these sources were compiled and how they are treated is crucial: the Qur'an was compiled into a written corpus early in Islamic history and is preserved in Arabic; hadith literature underwent a long process of collection and authentication, with major Sunni collections such as Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim classified according to chains of transmission (isnad) and the reliability of narrators.

Students should know that not every hadith carries equal weight: classical scholars developed meticulous criteria for categorising hadith as sahih (sound), hasan (good) or da'if (weak). These distinctions influence which reports can form the basis of fiqh rulings. You should also be familiar with the notion of abrogation (naskh), whereby some Qur'anic verses are understood to supersede others, and how scholars use textual context, grammar and the broader aims of the faith to interpret apparent tensions between texts.

## Secondary sources and legal methodology (Usul al‑fiqh)

When Qur'an and widely accepted Sunnah do not yield a direct answer, jurists turn to a structured methodology known as usul al-fiqh (principles of Islamic jurisprudence). Classical secondary sources include ijma (consensus of the community or scholars) and qiyas (analogy). Ijma provides communal authority when scholars agree on a point; qiyas extends an established ruling to a new case that shares an underlying reason (ʿillah). Beyond these, jurists developed techniques such as istihsan (juristic preference), maslaha (public interest), and consideration of ʿurf (custom), all of which allow flexible responses to particular circumstances.

A parallel strand of thought focuses on maqasid al-shari'a, the higher objectives of the law. Classical and later thinkers—most notably al-Shatibi—identified aims such as protection of religion, life, intellect, lineage and property. Using maqasid as an interpretative tool allows jurists to prioritise outcomes that preserve human dignity and social welfare, and it has been central to modern reformist approaches that seek to reconcile tradition with contemporary human rights and welfare concerns.

Ijtihad (independent reasoning) is the process by which a qualified jurist derives rulings using these tools. Historically, some periods were described as times when the "doors of ijtihad" were open; later debates suggested they had closed, prompting greater reliance on taqlid (following precedent). Contemporary scholarship, however, often reasserts the need for qualified ijtihad to address new ethical dilemmas in medicine, finance and international relations.

## Schools of Fiqh and jurisprudential diversity

Islamic legal thought is plural. Within Sunni Islam four major schools (madhahib) emerged: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali. Each school developed characteristic approaches to sources and methods. Abu Hanifa’s school is noted for pragmatic use of reason and analogical reasoning, the Maliki school for valuing the practice of the people of Medina as evidence of living tradition, al-Shafi'i for systematising usul al-fiqh and emphasising the primacy of texts, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal for a cautious attitude toward speculative reasoning and a strong reliance on hadith. In Shi'a Islam the Ja'fari school places a particular emphasis on the role of the Imam and on reasoned interpretation, with distinctions in the acceptance of qiyas and in how ijma is understood.

These schools produce different legal opinions on many matters while sharing the same foundational texts. For example, differences appear in family law, inheritance rules, and commercial ethics. Understanding the methodological reasons for these divergences—preference for local practice, weighing of hadith, different uses of analogy—helps explain why Islamic law is not monolithic and allows students to evaluate claims about what Shari'a “requires” in particular contexts.

## Key technical concepts in fiqh

Several technical terms recur in A-level questions and need precise explanation. Usul al-fiqh refers to principles and methodology; furuʿ (branches) refers to specific legal rulings; ijtihad is independent legal reasoning and taqlid denotes adherence to precedent. A fatwa is a juristic opinion issued by a mufti and is authoritative insofar as the issuing scholar’s status and methodology warrant acceptance; a mujtahid is a scholar qualified to perform ijtihad. The concept of darura (necessity) permits otherwise prohibited acts when life or health is at risk, illustrating the law’s ethical flexibility. Maqasid, as already noted, provide teleological grounding for interpretation, motivating rulings that preserve essential human goods. Students should be able to deploy these terms accurately and use short examples: for instance, invoking darura to explain why certain medicines containing prohibited substances are permitted in life‑saving treatment.

## Contemporary issues and case studies

Modernity presents complex challenges to traditional fiqh methods, and responses vary widely. Criminal law and hudud punishments provoke debate: classical hudud rulings require stringent standards of evidence and conditions rarely met today, prompting many contemporary Muslim-majority states to apply modified penalties, suspend hudud, or reserve them for rarely met circumstances. Family law is another area of public concern; many countries apply variations of personal law, which shapes marriage, divorce and inheritance, while secular legal systems may restrict or reinterpret religious rules in light of gender equality standards.

Economic life has inspired significant juristic innovation. The Qur'anic prohibition on riba (usury) led to the development of Islamic finance, which uses contractual devices and profit‑and‑loss sharing to achieve acceptable commercial outcomes without interest. Bioethical questions—organ donation, IVF and end-of-life care—have been addressed by contemporary jurists using maslaha and maqasid frameworks to balance preservation of life and respect for the sanctity of lineage and bodily integrity.

Legal pluralism within non-Muslim states adds another layer. In the UK and elsewhere, Sharia councils and tribunals offer arbitration in family disputes under voluntary arbitration law, leading to debates about legal protection for vulnerable parties and the limits of religiously informed adjudication. In contrast, some states (such as Iran and Saudi Arabia) integrate Shari'a into state law in a more comprehensive way, with differing emphases on codification, judicial structure and the role of clerical authorities. These differences are useful case studies for exam discussion because they invite analysis of continuity, reform, human rights, and the interaction between religion and state.

## Exam technique

To achieve high marks you must combine accurate AO1 knowledge with clear AO2 evaluation. Begin answers by defining terms precisely—distinguish Shari'a and fiqh, or explain usul al-fiqh—then move to explanation, showing how sources and methods operate in practice. Use named examples and scholars to illustrate points: refer to the role of the Qur'an and Sunnah, the classifications of hadith, the contribution of al‑Shafi'i to usul, the maqasid approach of al‑Shatibi, or the differing positions of madhahib when relevant.

When evaluating, set out strengths and weaknesses. Explain why ijma can provide authoritative community consensus but also why consensus is difficult to prove centuries later. Balance traditionalist positions against reformist strategies such as maqasid-based reinterpretation or renewed ijtihad. Make synoptic links where appropriate: show how ethical theories, philosophical debates about authority, or historical developments influence juristic reasoning. For example, link debates about free will and responsibility to issues in criminal law, or connect meta-ethical ideas about universal rights to contemporary human-rights critiques of certain Shari'a applications.

Structure longer essays into clear paragraphs: point, explain, evidence (scholar or case study), evaluation (possible counter-arguments). If asked to compare, organise the answer around points of similarity and difference and conclude with a balanced judgement that recognises complexity rather than asserting an absolute view. Use correct technical vocabulary throughout, and where possible display awareness of diversity—many questions require you to note differences between schools, between Sunni and Shi'a approaches, and between historical and modern contexts. Time-manage by allocating minutes per question and leave time to proofread for clarity and specialist terms.
