# Utilitarianism: Bentham and Mill (A-level Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: what utilitarianism is and why it matters
Utilitarianism is a consequentialist moral theory that judges the rightness or wrongness of actions by their outcomes. Its central idea is that actions are right insofar as they tend to promote happiness or pleasure and wrong insofar as they produce pain or unhappiness. For A-level study, the two most important figures are Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Bentham sets out the basic principle known as the principle of utility or “the greatest happiness for the greatest number.” Mill accepts that principle but refines it, especially by introducing a qualitative sense of pleasure and by addressing common criticisms. Understanding both thinkers helps students explain how a single ethical aim—maximising well‑being—can be interpreted in different ways and applied to real moral problems, from public policy to personal decisions.

## Jeremy Bentham: act utilitarianism and the hedonic calculus
Jeremy Bentham developed classical utilitarianism as a clear, practical, secular guide to law and morality. He argued that happiness and pleasure are the only things intrinsically valuable and that moral rules should be judged by how well they promote these ends. Bentham’s version is typically described as act utilitarianism: each individual action should be assessed according to the degree to which it increases overall happiness. To make this assessment systematic he proposed a ‘hedonic calculus’, a method for estimating the amount of pleasure or pain an action would bring. The calculus asks us to consider factors such as intensity, duration, certainty, remoteness (how soon the pleasure will occur), fecundity (the likelihood of leading to further pleasures), purity (likelihood of not producing pain) and extent (how many people are affected). Bentham applied this pragmatic method to law reform, insisting that legislators should aim to maximise social welfare; his interests ranged from prison reform to the design of penal systems. For exam purposes, bear in mind Bentham’s commitment to equality of pleasures—he treated all pleasures as commensurable and measurable, which makes his ethics straightforward but invites the criticism that it can reduce human life to a calculation.

## John Stuart Mill: higher pleasures and the development of rule aspects
John Stuart Mill accepted the core idea that happiness is the measure of right action, but he reacted against the allegedly crude consequences of Bentham’s quantitative approach. Mill introduced an important distinction between higher and lower pleasures: higher pleasures are intellectual, aesthetic or moral (for example, reading poetry or appreciating music), while lower pleasures are bodily or sensory. Mill argued that competent judges—people who have experienced both types—prefer higher pleasures even if they are accompanied by more pain or are of lesser quantity. This move allows Mill to claim that utilitarianism respects human dignity and intellectual development. Mill also developed what many read as an early form of rule utilitarianism: rather than calculating outcomes for every single act, Mill suggests that most actions should follow general rules that have historically promoted the greatest happiness, and that the “harm principle” limits interference with individual liberty: people should be free to act as they choose so long as they do not harm others. Mill’s work makes utilitarianism more compatible with justice and rights, and his utilitarianism underpins liberal political ideas such as free speech and legal protection of individual liberty.

## Similarities and differences between Bentham and Mill
Bentham and Mill share the foundational commitment to the principle of utility and the belief that moral thinking should be public, impartial and focused on consequences. Both aim to reform society by applying a clear moral standard rather than relying solely on tradition, religion or metaphysical claims. Their main differences concern the measurement and character of happiness and the role of rules. Bentham is a quantitative hedonist who believes pleasures can be compared by measuring features like intensity and duration; Mill introduces a qualitative hierarchy, insisting that some pleasures are intrinsically superior. Bentham’s approach encourages calculating outcomes for each act, while Mill allows for rules of thumb and general moral rules as reliable guides. Mill’s harm principle and his defence of individual rights also distance him from any utilitarian conclusion that would trample personal liberty for marginal gains in aggregate happiness. For exam answers, be ready to show how these contrasts lead to different moral verdicts in particular cases.

## Strengths of classical and Millian utilitarianism
The strengths that students should emphasise include clarity, practicality and impartiality. Utilitarianism offers a clear decision‑procedure: consider consequences and choose the option that maximises well‑being. This makes it attractive for public policy where consequences matter and trade‑offs are explicit, for example in health economics and law. Its impartiality treats each person’s happiness as equally important, a useful moral ideal against selfishness or privilege. Mill’s refinement adds moral realism: by valuing intellectual and moral pleasures more highly, his version responds to the common intuition that certain human goods deserve special respect. Mill’s harm principle also provides a principled liberal constraint on state power, which is useful in thinking about freedom, censorship and individual rights. In exam essays you should use concrete examples—such as deciding whether to legalise assisted dying, whether to permit certain forms of protest, or how to allocate scarce medical resources—to show how utilitarian reasoning works in practice.

## Weaknesses and common criticisms, with responses
Utilitarianism faces several classic objections that you should be able to explain and evaluate. The ‘measurement problem’ asks how we can meaningfully compare pleasures and pains, and whether a hedonic calculus is realistic. The ‘demandingness objection’ points out that utilitarianism can require extreme self‑sacrifice for the greater good. The ‘justice objection’ claims that utilitarian calculations could justify punishing an innocent person if doing so increases overall happiness. The ‘swine objection’ accuses utilitarianism of reducing human life to base pleasures. There are responses available: Mill’s qualitative distinction answers the swine charge and makes room for dignity; rule utilitarian approaches and Mill’s appeal to long‑run utility defend rights and fair procedures so as to avoid unjust outcomes; practical replies argue that moral rules and social institutions exist because they tend to produce the greatest happiness in the long run, so we should follow them rather than recalculating every time. Be prepared in exams to weigh these objections and responses and to show why some criticisms undermine utilitarianism more than others.

## Applying Bentham and Mill to ethical issues
Exam questions often ask for application. Use Bentham’s method when evaluating singular acts: imagine using the hedonic calculus to decide whether to lie to protect someone’s feelings, to perform animal experiments for medical research, or to use force as a deterrent. With Bentham, the verdict depends on adding up pleasures and pains, including effects on all those affected. With Mill, emphasise higher pleasures, rights and the harm principle: would the action respect individual liberty and moral dignity? For example, in the case of animal experimentation Bentham’s focus on aggregate pleasure might allow it where human benefit outweighs animal suffering, but Mill’s higher pleasures and his sensitivity to justice could push for strict limits and better welfare protections. When discussing nuclear weapons or public policy, use Mill to discuss rules and institutions that secure long‑term happiness, and Bentham to illustrate direct outcome‑based reasoning. Show evaluative awareness: point out where utilitarian reasoning is persuasive and where it may conflict with other moral intuitions or rights.

## How utilitarianism developed after Bentham and Mill (brief context)
After Mill, utilitarian thought continued to develop. Later writers introduced preference utilitarianism, which measures satisfaction of preferences rather than pleasure, and modern defenders have sought to combine utilitarian insights with rights and human psychology to make the theory more practically defensible. Contemporary debates also examine how to measure well‑being scientifically and whether utilitarian frameworks can inform public policy in areas such as global poverty, climate change and healthcare allocation. For A-level work, you do not need to master these developments in detail, but they are useful context when comparing classical utilitarianism with modern ethical thought and when showing the continuing influence of Bentham and Mill.

## Exam technique
When answering WJEC/Eduqas questions on Bentham and Mill, begin by defining utilitarianism and naming the version you will discuss (Bentham’s act utilitarianism or Mill’s refined utilitarianism). Show clear knowledge: explain the principle of utility, the hedonic calculus factors (intensity, duration, certainty, remoteness, fecundity, purity, extent) for Bentham and Mill’s higher/lower pleasures and the harm principle. Use examples to apply theory and to illustrate both thinkers’ likely verdicts. In evaluation, present at least two well‑developed criticisms and include the utilitarian responses—this demonstrates AO2 analysis. Balance is important: give reasons for and against, and conclude with a judgement that weighs strengths against weaknesses rather than a bare opinion. Refer to the language of the specification—consequences, impartiality, rule versus act, justice, and liberty—to show synoptic awareness. Keep your paragraphs focused, use specialist terminology accurately, and aim for clarity rather than excessive detail.
