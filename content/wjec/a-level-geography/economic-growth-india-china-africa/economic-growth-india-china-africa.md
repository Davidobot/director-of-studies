# Economic Growth & Development (India, China or African contexts) (A-level Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview and key concepts
Economic growth and development describe related but distinct processes: growth refers to increases in output and incomes, often measured by GDP, while development is broader and includes social progress, environmental sustainability and improvements in quality of life. The WJEC/Eduqas syllabus expects you to think in terms of specialised geographical concepts such as interdependence, globalisation, inequality, resilience, sustainability, causality and thresholds. When studying India, China or African contexts, always link particular facts to these concepts and consider scale: local, regional, national and global. Contemporary examples (generally within the last two decades unless historical context is useful) are required to show how theory applies in practice.

## Physical and demographic context that shapes development
Physical geography frames opportunity and constraint. In China and India relief, climate and water availability underpin where agriculture, industry and cities develop. Coastal plains and river valleys (the Yangtze, Yellow, Ganges and Indus systems) support dense settlement, transport corridors and export industries, while arid interiors or mountainous plateaux limit infrastructure and agriculture. In many African countries, a combination of climatic variability, limited reliable freshwater, and soils of varying fertility constrains agriculture and increases vulnerability to drought and desertification. Demography matters too. India’s demographic transition and large young workforce present a potential demographic dividend, whereas China’s recent ageing trend following decades of low fertility affects labour supply and welfare needs. In several African countries, youthful populations combine with rapid rural–urban migration to create pressure on jobs, housing and services. Always connect physical and demographic factors to economic outcomes: resource endowments, exposure to climate risks, and the human capital available to drive development.

## Drivers of economic change: industrialisation, services and the global shift
Economic change in these contexts reflects a mixture of domestic policy and global forces. China’s rapid industrialisation since the late 1970s, driven by market-oriented reforms and export-led growth, was supported by Special Economic Zones, state-led investment in infrastructure and large-scale manufacturing for global markets. India’s post-1991 liberalisation opened its economy to foreign investment and trade and saw explosive growth in the service and information-technology sectors, creating global outsourcing hubs in cities such as Bangalore and Hyderabad. In many African countries the pattern is more varied: export of commodities remains important in some (oil, minerals, agricultural products), while others are seeing growth in services, tourism and manufacturing through investment in export processing zones and industrial parks. The ‘global shift’—the relocation of production to lower-cost countries—has created manufacturing clusters in Asia and, increasingly, targeted industrialisation in Africa. Foreign direct investment (FDI), multinational corporations, global supply chains and trade agreements are central to these processes, producing both opportunities (jobs, technology transfer, export earnings) and challenges (dependency, vulnerability to global demand, labour issues).

## Social, political and cultural influences on development
Political systems and governance are decisive. China’s model of strong central planning with market mechanisms enabled rapid infrastructure investment and land-use decisions, but also raises questions about political freedoms and environmental accountability. India’s democratic system allows pluralistic decision-making and civil society voice, but slower policymaking and complex federal relations can impede rapid infrastructure roll-out. In Africa the diversity of political contexts matters: some states show stable governance and prudent management of resource revenues, while others face corruption, weak institutions and conflict that impede development. Social and cultural factors, such as gender roles, caste in India or ethnic divisions in parts of Africa, influence access to education, employment and land, thereby shaping inequality. Migration—rural to urban, internal and international—alters labour markets, creates diaspora networks that send remittances and ideas, and can both relieve and create local pressures. When you explain development outcomes, link them to governance, policy choices and social structures to show causality rather than simply listing factors.

## Environmental challenges and sustainability
Rapid economic growth has environmental consequences that threaten long-term development. China’s and India’s industrialisation produced significant air and water pollution, soil degradation and resource overuse, prompting recent policy shifts towards cleaner technologies and air-quality controls. In African contexts, unsustainable land use, deforestation and overgrazing contribute to desertification and reduced agricultural productivity. Water security is a recurring theme: competing demands for irrigation, industry and urban use create potential conflict, while climate change alters precipitation patterns, increasing flood and drought risk. Energy security is another pressure point. Fossil-fuel based growth raises emissions and air-quality problems; transitioning to renewables is both an environmental necessity and a developmental challenge that requires investment and coordination. Sustainable development strategies—integrating mitigation, adaptation, resilience-building and equitable resource management—are central to contemporary policy debates in all three contexts.

## Spatial patterns, urbanisation and inequality
Growth is rarely evenly distributed. Spatial inequalities manifest between global cities and peripheral regions, coast and interior, formal and informal economies. China’s Eastern seaboard and India’s major cities have been the primary beneficiaries of export-oriented development, concentrating capital, skills and services. Rapid urbanisation produces megacities—Mumbai, Shanghai, Lagos—that are engines of growth but also have large informal settlements with inadequate housing, sanitation and services. In many African cities, informal settlements such as Nairobi’s large slum areas illustrate the challenge of absorptive capacity. Rural areas may be left behind, with deindustrialisation or agricultural marginalisation creating pockets of deprivation. For exam answers, link processes such as industrial clustering, transport corridors, land tenure and investment patterns to specific spatial outcomes, and discuss policy attempts to rebalance development (regional investment, decentralisation, rural diversification).

## Case studies and policy responses
Good revision integrates crisp case studies that illustrate broader points. For China, Shenzhen and the SEZ programme show how targeted policies and infrastructure can transform a small town into a global factory hub; more recent policies emphasise ‘new-type urbanisation’ and green technologies. For India, the 1991 liberalisation catalysed a services boom with IT outsourcing centred in Bangalore, while challenges remain in manufacturing competitiveness and urban infrastructure. In Africa, examples vary: Botswana demonstrates relatively successful resource governance and social investment from diamond revenues, whereas Nigeria illustrates the ‘resource curse’—oil wealth combined with corruption and environmental harm. Ethiopia’s industrial parks (with foreign investment, including Chinese partnerships) show how deliberate industrial policy can create jobs, though outcomes depend on skill levels, supply chains and market access. For each case, explain the policy logic, assess outcomes across social, economic and environmental dimensions, and evaluate sustainability and equity.

## Strategies for sustainable, inclusive growth
Sustainable development demands policies across sectors and scales. Financial strategies include investing in education and health to build human capital, promoting small- and medium-sized enterprises, and using targeted social protection to reduce inequality. Spatial strategies involve improving rural connectivity, balanced regional investment and support for urban affordable housing and public transport. Environmental strategies require stricter pollution controls, integrated water resource management, renewable energy roll-out and conservation of critical ecosystems such as peatlands, forests and wetlands. Internationally, trade policy, aid, investment rules and debt management matter; for many African countries, responsible foreign investment and debt relief can be transformative if linked to governance reforms. In your essays, assess trade-offs (rapid growth versus environmental limits, or growth with rising inequality) and show how mitigation and adaptation measures can make development more resilient.

## Using the specification concepts in answers
Always make explicit links to the specialised concepts the specification highlights. Explain causality when you describe how a reform produced industrial growth; discuss equilibrium and feedback when describing how urbanisation affects resource cycles and then feeds back to constrain growth; use interdependence and globalisation to frame how exports, remittances and foreign investment integrate national economies into the world system; consider thresholds when explaining tipping points such as water scarcity or urban congestion that could stall development; and discuss resilience and sustainability when evaluating policy responses. Applying these concepts shows ‘geographical thinking’ and raises the quality of analysis from descriptive to evaluative.

## Exam technique
Start every essay by carefully unpacking the question: define key terms and establish the scale and time frame you will consider. Use a short introduction to set out your line of argument and name the case study or context you will apply. Structure the main body in clear, thematic paragraphs that address causes, consequences and responses; each paragraph should combine knowledge (AO1) with application and analysis (AO2), and where possible include evaluation or reference to data and field evidence (AO3). For example, when asked about the challenges of economic growth in India, begin with a definition, outline the historical reforms (1991 liberalisation), explain drivers (services, FDI), examine social and environmental consequences (inequality, pollution, urban slums), and evaluate responses (policy measures for sustainable cities, social programmes), concluding with a judged summary that weighs competing viewpoints. Use the specification concepts—inequality, interdependence, sustainability, thresholds—explicitly to frame arguments and to structure evaluation. In longer essays allocate time for a concise conclusion that synthesises the evidence and directly answers the question rather than introducing new material. For shorter questions use targeted examples and link each point back to the command word (explain, assess, evaluate). Where the question tests fieldwork or case-study knowledge, integrate specific local detail (location, stakeholders, measurable outcomes) and reflect briefly on methods or data quality if relevant. Finally, practise planning and timing: examiners reward clarity, relevance and well-evidenced argument as much as factual recall.
