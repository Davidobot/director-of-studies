# Coastal Landscapes (A-level Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: the coast as a dynamic system
Coasts are best understood as open, dynamic systems where energy and material flow between the land, sea and atmosphere. Using the systems language expected by WJEC — inputs, stores, flows (transfers) and outputs — helps to structure explanations of coastal behaviour. Inputs to a coastal system include waves, tides, winds and sediment supplied from rivers, cliffs and offshore sources. Stores include beaches, dunes, saltmarshes and offshore bars; transfers are the processes that move sediment (longshore drift, traction, saltation) and energy (wave propagation, tidal currents); outputs might be sediment export to deeper water or loss through anthropogenic extraction. Coastal sediment cells are useful operational units for management because they typically contain closed or semi-closed budgets of sediment along stretches of coastline. Key specialised concepts from the specification — dynamic equilibrium, feedbacks, thresholds, mitigation, adaptation, resilience and interdependence — should be used to explain how coasts respond to both natural drivers and human activity.

## Coastal processes: waves, tides and the drivers of change
Waves are the principal agents of coastal change and vary in type and energy. Constructive waves, with long wavelengths and low height, build beaches through gentle swash and weak backwash; destructive waves are steeper, more energetic and remove sediment through strong backwash and powerful erosive mechanisms. Wave energy at a particular location depends on fetch (the distance wind blows across open water), wind strength and duration, and local bathymetry. Wave refraction concentrates energy on headlands and disperses it in bays, creating differential erosion. Tidal regimes and tidal currents are major drivers in estuarine environments; diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal ranges influence the extent of intertidal zones where sediment can accumulate. Sub-aerial processes, including physical weathering, chemical weathering and biological activity, weaken cliffs between episodes of marine attack. Mass movement processes such as rockfall, rotational slump and landslides can rapidly alter cliff profiles and supply large volumes of sediment to the shore. All of these processes interact through feedback loops: for example, loss of a protective beach lowers the cliff base and increases erosion, which in turn supplies more sediment at different grain sizes.

## Erosional landforms and the influence of geology and structure
High‑energy coastlines with resistant lithologies develop a distinctive suite of erosional landforms. The interplay between lithology and structural geology (bedding, dip, jointing, faults and folding) controls susceptibility to marine erosion and the resulting landforms. Where waves focus on projections of hard rock, headlands, cliffs, caves, arches, stacks and stumps can form. Wave-cut platforms record former cliff bases and are useful long-term indicators of cliff retreat. Rocky coasts in Wales and the UK offer clear examples: Pembrokeshire and the Gower Peninsula show dramatic cliffs, stacks and blowholes formed in resistant strata, whereas softer sediments nearby retreat more rapidly. The cliff profile, the presence of bedding planes and jointing, and the rate of sub‑aerial weathering together determine the mode and rate of cliff failure.

## Depositional landforms, beaches and estuaries
Low‑energy coasts encourage deposition and the development of beaches, spits, bars, tombolos and cuspate forelands. Sediment is sorted by wave energy into characteristic textures along a beach profile; fine sands tend to dominate gently sloping sheltered shores while pebbles and shingle accumulate where wave energy is higher. Longshore drift transports sediment alongshore and can create spits where the coastline changes direction. Tombolos and barrier beaches form where sediment links offshore features to the mainland, with Chesil Beach on the south coast of England a classic example. Estuarine environments emphasise the interaction between fluvial and tidal processes. Tidal flats and saltmarshes develop where fine sediments settle under reducing energy conditions; biotic processes, including vegetation growth and bioturbation, stabilise sediments and enable further accretion. The Severn Estuary demonstrates the power of tidal processes to shape wide intertidal zones and produce complex sedimentary environments.

## Aeolian, fluvial and biotic contributions
Coastal landforms are also shaped by wind, rivers and living organisms. Aeolian processes transport sand inland to form dune systems where vegetation establishes and succession proceeds, producing distinctive dune zonation and succession sequences. Fluvial inputs are crucial to estuarine sediment budgets and can either supply sediment or be reduced by upstream reservoirs and river management. Biotic processes can have outsized protective roles: mangrove forests in tropical coastlines trap sediment and dissipate wave energy, reducing erosion and buffering storm surges, while coral reefs attenuate wave energy offshore and support beaches on sheltered islands. International examples such as the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and the role of coral reefs in protecting low-lying Pacific atolls help to illustrate the interdependence of people, ecosystems and coastal geomorphology.

## Temporal scales, sea-level change and thresholds
Coastal change operates over timescales from seconds (storm impacts, waves attacking a cliff) to seasons (beach profile cycles) to millennia (eustatic sea-level change and isostatic adjustments). Short-term events can trigger rapid changes that reveal system sensitivity; storms can cause cliff collapses and beach erosion in a matter of hours, while longer-term sea-level rise driven by climate change causes shifts in shoreline position and tidal range. The distinction between eustatic (global) sea-level changes driven by ocean volume and regional isostatic adjustments (for example the relative uplift of northern Britain since deglaciation) must be clear in explanations. Thresholds are important: a system may adjust through feedbacks and retain a dynamic equilibrium until a threshold is crossed, after which permanent, possibly abrupt changes occur. Examples include sediment starvation behind hard defences that leads to irreversible beach loss, or accelerated sea-level rise that overwhelms accommodation space in estuaries, forcing managed retreat.

## Human impacts and coastal management strategies
Human activity alters coastal processes and sediment budgets in many ways. Hard engineering such as seawalls, groynes and revetments can protect assets locally but often interrupt longshore drift and degrade beaches down-drift. Offshore dredging and beach material extraction reduce sediment supply. Urbanisation and coastal infrastructure can create coastal squeeze where habitats like saltmarsh and dunes cannot migrate inland as sea level rises. Management responses fall along a spectrum from hard protection to soft engineering and policy-led adaptation. Soft strategies include beach nourishment, dune restoration and the creation of buffer zones. Managed realignment, where defences are removed to allow tidal inundation in a controlled way, can restore natural sedimentation and create habitat; the Medmerry scheme in southern England is a high-profile UK example of managed realignment that reduced flood risk while creating intertidal habitats. Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) take a sediment‑cell approach and attempt to combine economic, social and environmental objectives. The choice of strategy should be evaluated in terms of mitigation (reducing harm), adaptation (living with change), resilience (ability to recover) and equity (distributional impacts), with explicit recognition of trade-offs and long-term sustainability.

## Fieldwork, skills and the coastal sediment budget
Coastal landscapes provide excellent opportunities for fieldwork required by the specification and the Independent Investigation (NEA). Beach profiles, pebble sampling and roundness analysis, longshore drift experiments using tracers, dune transects recording vegetation zonation, and mapping management structures are standard practical activities. Analysis often combines quantitative techniques (measures of central tendency and dispersion for pebble size, storm hydrographs for short-term fluvial inputs, or simple sediment budget calculations) with qualitative methods (photographic interpretation, interviews about local management and tourist impacts). Geo-spatial tools such as GIS and aerial imagery are particularly valuable for measuring rates of cliff retreat, mapping shoreline change and placing local observations in a broader sediment-cell context. When preparing any investigation, link field data explicitly to the coastal sediment budget concept: identify sources, transfers and sinks, and consider human influences on each component. This systems framing strengthens explanations and evaluation.

## Exam technique
Answers in the Changing Landscapes section should speak the language of the specification: use systems terminology (inputs, stores, flows, outputs), reference specialised concepts such as dynamic equilibrium, feedbacks and thresholds, and always anchor explanations with named examples. When asked about processes, describe both the mechanism (for example hydraulic action, abrasion, or saltation) and the geomorphological consequence, linking process to landform and to scale where appropriate. For data response questions, begin by interpreting the supplied figures clearly, then use the data to support causal explanations and link to wider knowledge — do not simply describe graphs. For synoptic or extended questions (such as assess or evaluate), structure your answer with an introduction that defines key terms and states a clear line of argument, development paragraphs that apply theory and case study evidence, and a conclusion that synthesises findings and offers balanced judgement; where possible suggest realistic management or further research options. In essays about management, compare alternatives and consider social, economic and environmental costs and benefits; reference local examples from Wales (for instance cliff coastlines in Pembrokeshire or sandy beaches and dunes on the Gower) as well as broader UK or international cases to show range and depth. Use annotated diagrams where they add clarity: a labelled sediment cell, a beach profile or a cross-section of a cliff-dune system can earn marks and focus your explanation. Time management is crucial in the two-hour paper: allocate time according to the mark-weighting of questions, and leave a few minutes to check that terminology is precise and that case study details are accurate. Finally, practise applying fieldwork findings to exam-style questions: examiners reward candidates who can connect primary data, theory and management in coherent, well-evidenced responses that demonstrate “thinking like a geographer.”
