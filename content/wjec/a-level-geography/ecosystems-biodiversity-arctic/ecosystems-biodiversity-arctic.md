# Ecosystems and Biodiversity (including Arctic tundra) (A-level Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: why ecosystems matter and how geographers study them
Ecosystems are the interacting networks of living organisms and the physical environment in which they exist. At A-level we study them not as isolated curiosities but as dynamic systems: flowing energy, cycling nutrients, and shifting stores and flows of water and carbon across space and time. Thinking in terms of systems helps explain causality — how a change in one component (for example increased temperature) produces knock-on effects elsewhere (such as altered plant growth, permafrost thaw or changes in river discharge). Geographers focus on multiple scales when studying ecosystems: from the local patch studied in fieldwork to the global distribution of biomes that underpins questions of conservation and human welfare. The specialised concepts emphasised by the WJEC / Eduqas specification — equilibrium, feedback, interdependence, resilience and thresholds — provide a vocabulary for explaining both short-term variability (seasonal cycles) and long-term change (post-glacial landforms or anthropogenic climate change).

It is useful to keep two aims in mind when revising: first, to be able to describe the structure and functioning of ecosystems clearly (what the components are and how they work); and second, to be able to explain human interactions with those systems, including threats, management and sustainable use. Fieldwork is central to both aims: measuring species composition, mapping vegetation zones, sampling soils and peat depth, and using GIS and remote sensing are all practical ways of gathering evidence that links theory to real landscapes.

## Structure and functioning of ecosystems: energy flows and nutrient cycles
An ecosystem can be thought of as having stores and flows. Plants, animals, soils and litter represent biological stores; nutrients and carbon are the chemical stores; sunlight, water and organic matter are the energy and material flows between them. Primary productivity (the rate at which plants fix solar energy through photosynthesis) is a key concept because it sets the upper limit on energy available to consumers. Productivity varies greatly between biomes: tropical rainforests are highly productive with rapid nutrient cycling, whereas tundra systems have low productivity and slow nutrient turnover.

Nutrient cycles — particularly of carbon and nitrogen — are central to understanding ecosystem functioning. Carbon moves rapidly between atmosphere and vegetation via photosynthesis and respiration, more slowly into soils as litter and humus, and on geological timescales into fossil fuels and sediments. The water cycle is tightly linked: soil moisture influences decomposition rates; evapotranspiration links vegetation to atmospheric processes; and hydrological connectivity carries dissolved carbon from land to ocean. Mass-balance approaches are useful for exam answers: if inputs to a store (for instance carbon sequestered in peat) are larger than outputs, the store increases; if outputs surpass inputs, the store declines.

Feedbacks — where a change in one part of a system amplifies or dampens further change — are important. A positive feedback might be permafrost thaw: warming causes thaw, releasing greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane), which lead to more warming. A negative feedback could be increased plant growth that sequesters some extra atmospheric carbon, partly offsetting warming. Thresholds and tipping points are also exam-relevant: ecosystems may tolerate gradual change until a threshold is crossed and the system shifts to a new state (for example peatland drainage causing peat decomposition and conversion to grassland).

## Biodiversity: measurement, threats and implications
Biodiversity is more than a headcount of species. It includes species richness, evenness and genetic and habitat diversity. Measures such as Simpson’s diversity index or species richness are used in fieldwork to quantify diversity and to compare sites. It is important to be able to explain what such indices mean in practice: a high Simpson value indicates a community in which many species are present and no single species dominates.

Biological diversity is under pressure from direct and indirect human actions. Direct threats include habitat loss (deforestation, wetland drainage), over-exploitation (overfishing, unsustainable timber extraction) and invasive species. Indirect threats include climate change, pollution and altered disturbance regimes. The consequences are local and global: loss of pollinators affects agricultural output; decline of peatlands releases carbon and reduces water quality; coral reef degradation reduces coastal protection and fisheries. When answering exam questions, link threats to scale and to human well-being: local livelihoods, national economies and global biogeochemical cycles are all affected.

Conservation choices are often constrained by limited resources, and decisions about which species or habitats to prioritise can be controversial. You should be able to discuss trade-offs and the social dimensions of conservation: who benefits, who loses, and how representation and values influence outcomes.

## Ecosystem services, human dependence and management strategies
Ecosystems provide tangible goods such as timber, food and medicines, and intangible services including water purification, flood mitigation and cultural identity. The concept of ecosystem services helps bridge natural science and human geography because it frames ecosystems in terms of benefits to people. When addressing essay questions, show an understanding of interdependence: communities depend on ecosystems, but their activities (agriculture, urban development, energy extraction) modify those systems.

Management strategies range from strict protection (no-take reserves) to sustainable use (community-managed resources, selective logging) and restoration (rewetting peatlands, reforestation). Cost–benefit reasoning is often used to justify action: for instance, restoring peatlands may be expensive initially but yields long-term gains in carbon storage, water regulation and biodiversity. Governance operates at many scales: local community groups, national regulations and international agreements (for example conventions aimed at biodiversity or wetland protection). Effective management often combines scientific assessment with local knowledge and participatory decision-making.

From a skills perspective you need to be comfortable with the kinds of field techniques that provide evidence for management decisions: quadrat sampling to assess plant communities, transects to map zonation, peat depth measurements for carbon estimates, water chemistry tests for eutrophication, and remote sensing to measure land-cover change. You should also understand basic data presentation (maps, graphs) and interpretation, and be able to evaluate the reliability and validity of primary and secondary data.

## The Arctic tundra as a case study: characteristics, threats and sustainable management
The Arctic tundra is explicitly listed in the WJEC / Eduqas specification as a case study. This biome is characterised by low temperatures, a short growing season, low primary productivity, and soils dominated by permafrost with a seasonally active layer. Vegetation is typically low-growing: mosses, lichens, dwarf shrubs and resilient grasses. Fauna includes migratory species that seasonally depend on tundra productivity, and specialized resident species adapted to cold.

Permafrost is a defining feature and a store of ancient organic carbon. Warming trends have led to active-layer deepening and permafrost degradation, which in turn release greenhouse gases, alter hydrology, and cause ground instability. These processes illustrate the system concepts of feedback and threshold: permafrost thaw is a positive feedback to global warming and may push the system toward new states (thermokarst landscapes, altered vegetation).

Human pressures include resource extraction (mineral and hydrocarbon exploration), infrastructure development, tourism and overharvesting in some local contexts. Indigenous peoples depend on tundra ecosystems for livelihoods and cultural identity, so any management strategy must consider their rights and knowledge. Conflicts can arise between economic interests and conservation goals, and between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

Management approaches include protected area designation, limits on resource extraction, community-led stewardship, and mitigation of global climate change through international policy. Locally, adaptation measures such as building techniques that reduce permafrost thaw can reduce vulnerability. From an exam perspective, be prepared to evaluate different strategies, discussing effectiveness, equity and feasibility. Field evidence in the Arctic may be supplemented by remote sensing, long-term monitoring and indigenous knowledge; be ready to consider the limits of available data.

## Conservation, restoration and the role of policy and fieldwork evidence
Conservation strategies vary from in situ protection and sustainable use to ex situ measures such as seed banks. Restoring degraded ecosystems is increasingly important: peatland rewetting in the UK provides a clear example because it restores biodiversity, improves water quality and sequesters carbon. Similarly, marine protected areas can protect spawning grounds and sustain fisheries if they are well-managed and appropriately sited.

Policies are framed across scales. National land-use planning, agri-environment schemes and protected area legislation create the conditions for conservation on the ground; international agreements and funding mechanisms shape the wider context. Non-governmental organisations and local communities play a critical role in implementation and monitoring. When explaining management in essays, make links between the evidence base (field data, monitoring), the policy instruments (regulation, incentives) and outcomes for people and nature.

Fieldwork provides the primary evidence that underpins decisions. Good investigations link a clear research question to appropriate sampling and analysis methods, use suitable presentation techniques and evaluate reliability. Practical skills you will be expected to use include stratified and systematic sampling, quadrats and transects for vegetation surveys, measurements of peat depth and bulk density for carbon estimates, simple water chemistry tests, and the use of GIS to integrate spatial data. In the NEA, clear justification of methods, thoughtful analysis and a critical evaluation of strengths and limitations are essential. Remember that valid conclusions depend on appropriate sampling design, awareness of measurement error and appropriate use of statistical and graphical techniques.

## Exam technique
In answering exam questions, always begin by identifying the command word and the required focus (describe, explain, evaluate, assess, discuss). For short response questions, use precise definitions and concise examples. For extended responses, organise your essay with a clear introduction that sets out the argument and the concepts you will use (systems, feedbacks, thresholds, resilience), followed by well-structured paragraphs that balance description and explanation and that link evidence to theory. Use case studies to illustrate points: for example, peatland restoration in the UK to discuss carbon stores and management, or permafrost thaw in the Arctic to explain feedbacks and thresholds. When using fieldwork as evidence, be specific about methods and how they support conclusions: mention transects, quadrats, species indices or peat depth measurements as appropriate.

Evaluation and critical thinking are essential at A-level. When asked to assess or evaluate, weigh strengths and limitations, consider alternative interpretations and discuss scale and time-frame issues. Always comment on uncertainty in data and on ethical or social implications of management choices. Use specialist vocabulary accurately and link human impacts to ecosystem processes and services. Finally, allocate time proportionally in the exam, plan longer answers briefly before writing, and practise past-question responses that integrate conceptual understanding with empirical examples and fieldwork evidence.
