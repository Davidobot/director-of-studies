# Tectonic Hazards (volcanoes, earthquakes, tsunamis) (A-level Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: what tectonic hazards are and why they matter
Tectonic hazards arise from processes within and at the boundaries of the Earth’s lithosphere and asthenosphere. They include sudden events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis, and they produce both primary effects (ground shaking, lava flows, pyroclastic flows, seismic sea-waves) and secondary effects (landslides, liquefaction, fires, lahars, ash clouds, coastal inundation). For A-level study on the WJEC / Eduqas specification, it is important to treat these hazards as parts of dynamic systems. Emphasise how inputs, stores and outputs interact through feedbacks and thresholds so that a gradual change (for example regional uplift, magma accumulation or rising sea level) can alter risk over different time scales. Use the language of the specification: risk, resilience, mitigation, adaptation, inequality and interdependence, and always link physical processes to human outcomes and management choices.

## Plate tectonics and the mechanics of hazard generation
Plate tectonics is the unifying framework for understanding the global distribution of tectonic hazards. The Earth’s outer shell is divided into plates whose relative motions are driven by mantle convection, slab pull and ridge push. At divergent margins (mid-ocean ridges and continental rifts) extension produces basaltic magmas, fissure eruptions and shallow earthquakes; at convergent margins (subduction zones) one plate descends beneath another producing deep-focus and megathrust earthquakes, volatile-rich magmas and explosive stratovolcanoes; at transform or conservative margins horizontal slip concentrates shear stress and causes shallow, often destructive earthquakes. Hotspot volcanism, caused by mantle plumes and independent of plate boundaries, generates large shield volcanoes and persistent eruptive activity in places such as Hawaiʻi and Iceland. When studying hazards, consider key attributes of the hazard profile — magnitude, frequency, speed of onset, duration, areal extent and predictability — because these determine impacts and appropriate responses.

## Volcanoes: types, processes, impacts and management
Volcanoes differ in size, shape and eruption style according to magma chemistry, gas content and tectonic setting. Mafic basaltic magmas are low in silica and fluid, producing effusive eruptions and broad shield volcanoes; intermediate and silicic magmas (andesitic, rhyolitic) are more viscous and gas-rich, producing explosive eruptions and steep-sided stratovolcanoes. Hazards include lava flows, pyroclastic density currents, ash falls, ballistic fragments, volcanic gases and secondary events such as lahars and jökulhlaups where ice or snow melts. Ash plumes can disrupt aviation and have global atmospheric effects, as seen when Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2010 and grounded flights across Europe. Volcanic impacts vary with scale: locally a pyroclastic flow can destroy communities within minutes, regionally ash can collapse roofs and contaminate water supplies, and globally a very large eruption can affect climate and agriculture. Management combines monitoring (seismic networks, gas emissions, ground deformation measured with GPS and InSAR), hazard mapping, land-use planning, early warning, community education and long-term adaptation such as relocation or construction of diversion channels for lahars. Policy choices often present trade-offs: restraint of development in hazard zones protects lives but has socio-economic consequences for people who rely on fertile volcanic soils or tourism.

## Earthquakes: processes, effects and mitigation
Earthquakes occur when strain accumulated in the crust is released suddenly along faults. They generate body waves (P and S) and surface waves; modern magnitude is measured by moment magnitude (Mw) and intensity by scales such as the Modified Mercalli Intensity, which records observed effects. Primary earthquake hazards are ground shaking and surface rupture, and common secondary hazards are rupturing of lifelines, landslides, liquefaction of water-saturated sediments and post-event fires. Liquefaction, where saturated sands and silts lose strength, was a major cause of damage in Christchurch, New Zealand. The human consequences of earthquakes are strongly mediated by social and political factors: quality of building stock and enforcement of codes, population density, time of day, emergency preparedness and governance all influence whether a hazardous event becomes a disaster. Mitigation strategies range from earthquake-resistant design and retrofitting to land-use controls, emergency planning, public education and rapid search-and-rescue capacity. Modern monitoring provides some short-term forecasts of elevated seismic risk through patterns of foreshocks and strain accumulation, but reliable prediction of the exact time and place of a quake remains beyond current science; therefore preparedness and resilient infrastructure are central to A-level exam answers.

## Tsunamis: origins, wave physics, impacts and warning systems
Tsunamis are long-wavelength shallow-water waves most commonly generated by vertical displacement of the seafloor during large subduction-zone earthquakes, though submarine landslides, volcanic flank collapses and meteorite impacts can also trigger them. In deep water tsunami waves have low amplitude and long wavelengths and may pass unnoticed by ships, but as they approach shallow coastal waters wave speed reduces while wave height increases dramatically and energy concentrates to produce run-up and inundation. Key physical relationships such as wave speed being proportional to the square root of water depth (c ≈ √(g·h)) help explain rapid changes in coastal amplitude. The humanitarian impact of tsunamis is illustrated starkly by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed around a quarter of a million people across multiple countries where early warning systems and coastal defences were minimal, and by the 2011 Tohoku event where a well-prepared country still faced catastrophic loss because of the tsunami’s size and coastal geometry. Tsunami mitigation blends seismic monitoring, ocean buoys such as DART arrays, real-time modelling, coastal defences, evacuation planning and public education. The limitations of warning systems should be acknowledged: detection and communication are essential, but people must trust and act on warnings for them to be effective.

## Human vulnerability, inequality and the hazard management cycle
A-level work must go beyond physical description to analyse human vulnerability and the ways societies prepare for, respond to and recover from tectonic hazards. Vulnerability is shaped by economic development, building quality, governance, social inequality and demographic factors; poor communities are often more exposed because of informal housing and limited insurance options, and inequality influences both immediate outcomes and long-term recovery. The hazard management cycle — mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery — provides a framework for case study analysis, and you should discuss a mix of structural measures (seawalls, building regulations, engineered slopes) and non-structural measures (land-use zoning, insurance, public education, early warning and evacuation plans). Concepts such as resilience and adaptation are central: resilience describes the capacity to resist, absorb and recover from shocks, while adaptation involves longer-term changes to reduce vulnerability. Evaluate trade-offs: the cost of retrofitting may be high but cheaper in the long term than repeated reconstruction, and some protection measures can produce perverse outcomes by encouraging development in risky zones.

## Contrasting examples and how to use them in answers
Exam answers should draw on specific, contemporary case studies that illustrate contrasts of context, response and outcome. For example, compare Haiti 2010 and Chile 2010 to show the role of governance and building standards: the magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Haiti caused catastrophic mortality and prolonged humanitarian crisis because of weak infrastructure and limited emergency capacity, whereas the magnitude 8.8 earthquake in Chile resulted in far fewer deaths relative to shaking intensity due to stricter building codes and effective preparedness. Use volcanic examples to contrast eruptive style and global impacts: Mount Pinatubo (1991, Philippines) produced a high-volume explosive eruption with global climatic cooling for a couple of years and major local lahars, while Kīlauea and other Hawaiian eruptions demonstrate long-lived effusive hazards with localised risk but persistent economic consequences. For tsunamis, the 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011 Tōhoku events provide complementary lessons about early warning, coastal geography, population exposure and the differing outcomes where preparedness, education and infrastructure varied. When you present a case study, be precise with dates, locations and outcomes, and explicitly link physical processes to human factors and management responses.

## Exam technique
In exams, read the question carefully to identify command words such as 'describe', 'explain', 'assess' or 'evaluate' and then tailor your structure accordingly. For descriptive questions, organise material chronologically or spatially and include clear definitions of key terms (for example, distinguish magnitude and intensity, or define a tsunami). For explanation and evaluation tasks, set out clear chains of reasoning that link cause to effect and include systems thinking vocabulary such as inputs, outputs, feedbacks and thresholds. Always use named, contemporary case studies to illustrate points; examiners reward specificity, so name the event, give a brief factual outline and then analyse causes, impacts and responses. Where possible, compare contrasting contexts to show breadth of understanding, for example contrasting high-income and low-income responses or differing tectonic settings. Use simple diagrams where they add clarity, such as a cross-section showing subduction and tsunami generation or a labelled graph of seismic wave travel; ensure diagrams are accurate and integrated into your explanation. In extended answers, allocate time to structure an introduction that frames your argument, several analytical paragraphs that develop evidence and explanation, and a concise conclusion that evaluates the arguments and draws out a judgement. Finally, apply the A-level concepts required by WJEC / Eduqas: link ideas to resilience, mitigation, adaptation and inequality, and where relevant comment on spatial and temporal scales and the limitations of monitoring and prediction. Practise writing under timed conditions, plan answers briefly in the exam, and annotate your case studies during revision so you can deploy them quickly and precisely when answering questions.
