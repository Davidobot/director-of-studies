# Global Governance: migration and ocean commons (A-level Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: connections, scale and specialised concepts
Global governance of migration and the oceans are linked strands of 21st century geography. Both are shaped by accelerating flows of people, goods, information and capital that have been made possible by transport and communications technology. Studying these topics requires attention to scale: local experiences of migration and coastal livelihoods, national immigration policies, and international laws and institutions that claim to manage shared spaces. Key specialised concepts to bear in mind are globalisation (how places become connected), causality (drivers behind movement and use), interdependence (mutual effects between source and destination places), risk and resilience (vulnerability and capacity to respond), sustainability and mitigation (attempts to regulate use), and the idea of a global commons (resources beyond national jurisdiction). Thinking like a geographer means linking processes to places and assessing who gains and who loses from those connections.

## Globalisation, migration and a shrinking world
Global migration flows must be seen in the context of globalisation: the growth of international trade, multinational corporations, cheap air travel and instant digital communication that have made the world feel smaller for many people. Migrants include labour migrants seeking work, students moving for education, refugees escaping conflict or persecution, and family migrants. Migration can be tracked and mapped at a variety of scales: internal rural-to-urban moves reshape megacities, while international corridors link sending and receiving countries. Improvements in transport reduce travel time; mobile phones and social media enable diasporas to maintain connections, organise remittances and build transnational networks that both sustain and stimulate further movement. For exam answers, remember to explain how technological and economic changes reduce the cost and risk of movement and create new opportunities as well as tensions in destination and origin regions.

## Causes of international economic migration
Economic migration is often driven by a mix of push and pull factors. Push factors include poverty, lack of employment, falling commodity prices and environmental problems that undermine livelihoods. Pull factors in destination countries include higher wages, labour demand in specific sectors and perceived opportunities for social mobility. Historical and political links — such as former colonial ties, shared language, and freedom-of-movement arrangements — also channel flows. Superpower and high-income states can exert a magnetic pull because of the concentration of global services, finance and technology: cities such as London, New York, and major global hubs offer jobs in the tertiary and quaternary sectors that attract skilled and unskilled migrants alike. Economic migration produces benefits such as remittances sent home, which can raise incomes and fund education, but it also causes challenges: the 'brain drain' of skilled workers can starve source countries of vital professionals, while rapid in-migration in receiving cities can strain housing and public services.

## Refugee movements: causes, consequences and management
Refugees and internally displaced people are pushed from their homes by conflict, political instability, persecution and, increasingly, environmental disasters linked to climate change. Refugee crises are often sudden and generate acute humanitarian needs as well as political tensions between and within states. Consequences for refugees include perilous journeys, loss of livelihoods and social exclusion; host communities can experience economic and social pressures but may also benefit from new skills and labour. Management of refugee movements involves a patchwork of actors: international organisations such as the UN refugee agency coordinate protection and aid, national governments set asylum policies, and NGOs deliver services. Responses range from short-term humanitarian relief to long-term resettlement, integration programmes or, controversially, deterrence and externalisation of borders. Case studies commonly used in exams include the Syrian refugee flows to neighbouring states and Europe, and the Rohingya crisis that led to large-scale displacement into Bangladesh. Always evaluate responses in terms of effectiveness, equity and political feasibility.

## Rural–urban migration and the challenge of urbanisation in developing countries
Within many developing and emerging economies, rural-to-urban migration is a dominant internal flow. Mechanised agriculture, land consolidation and the expansion of global supply chains can reduce rural employment, while cities offer jobs in manufacturing, services and informal economies. The rapid growth of urban populations creates megacities and secondary cities that often struggle to provide housing, sanitation and transport. Outcomes include the expansion of informal settlements and slums, rising inequality and environmental pressure on peri-urban land. However, urbanisation also generates economic dynamism, innovation and improved access to markets and services for many. Governance challenges are complex: national and local authorities, private developers and community groups each play roles in shaping how migration affects urban form and social outcomes. In essays, compare different governance responses, for example top-down masterplans for new towns versus grassroots upgrading schemes that empower communities.

## The global governance of the oceans: institutions, laws and strategic value
Oceans are vital for trade, food, climate regulation and communication, yet much of the sea lies beyond national control. After 1945 a system of international institutions and legal instruments developed to manage maritime affairs. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is central: it defines territorial seas, exclusive economic zones (EEZs) extending up to 200 nautical miles from coasts, and the high seas beyond national jurisdiction. The concept of the global commons applies particularly to high seas and the deep seabed, where collective management is essential but difficult. Supranational institutions and forums — from specialised UN agencies to regional bodies and ad hoc coalitions — try to balance access, conservation and geopolitical interests. Oceans also have strategic value for states: control of chokepoints like the Suez and Panama canals, and security of sea lanes, are priorities for trade-dependent economies. These factors feed into geopolitical competition, resource claims (for instance in the Arctic as ice retreats) and the need for coordinated management.

## Shipping, cables, resources and sovereignty
Global shipping networks carry the vast majority of traded goods, organised around containerised systems and major ports. The undersea cables that traverse the ocean floor carry most international internet traffic; damage to these cables can disrupt communications and economies. Both shipping and cables illustrate the intimate link between the physical ocean and global connectivity, but they are also vulnerable to natural hazards and human threats such as undersea landslides, tsunamis, piracy and targeted sabotage. Ocean resources — fisheries, hydrocarbons and potential mineral wealth on the seabed — raise questions of sovereignty and equity. Coastal states exercise rights within their EEZs, but competing claims over islands and seabeds, and the prospect of deep-sea mining beyond national jurisdiction, create geopolitical tensions and raise ethical debates about who benefits. For a balanced answer, weigh economic opportunity against ecological risk and the marginalisation of small or landlocked states.

## Managing marine environments and pollution: dilemmas and strategies
Marine governance must address over-exploitation, pollution and habitat loss. Fisheries management ranges from national quotas to regional fisheries management organisations and local no-take zones, yet enforcement is uneven and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing persists. Plastic pollution and oil spills exemplify the global nature of marine waste: plastics accumulate in gyres and microplastics enter food webs, while oil spills cause acute local damage with long-term consequences. Strategies to manage marine problems operate at multiple scales: international conventions and agreements set standards and targets; regional collaboration can tackle shared stocks or pollution pathways; national regulation implements rules within territorial waters; and local actions, such as community-based marine protected areas, can restore habitats and livelihoods. Approaches that combine regulation, market instruments and community participation are most promising, but they must confront inequalities in capacity, enforcement and political will. In essays, consider trade-offs and who bears the costs of management.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on global governance, migration and the ocean commons, start by defining key terms and setting the scale of your response. For shorter questions, offer a clear definition and a concise example. For extended response questions, structure your answer into an introduction that sets out your argument, several balanced paragraphs that develop distinct points with named examples, and a reasoned conclusion that directly addresses the question and acknowledges limitations. Use specialised concepts such as globalisation, causality, interdependence, risk and sustainability explicitly to demonstrate conceptual understanding. Always link processes to places: explain how global drivers produce specific local outcomes and how local actors influence global systems. Where the question asks for evaluation, weigh different perspectives, discuss trade-offs and suggest realistic management options; make clear judgements rather than lists of measures. Time management is essential: allocate roughly a quarter of your time to planning and the last five to ten minutes to a concise conclusion. Finally, practise applying the theory to contemporary case studies — for migration these might include Syrian displacement, EU labour mobility and remittance economies from the Philippines, and for oceans examples such as the Mediterranean migration routes, Somali piracy responses, Arctic resource claims, or plastic gyres. Quality of examples and the ability to connect scales and actors will lift answers into the higher mark bands.
