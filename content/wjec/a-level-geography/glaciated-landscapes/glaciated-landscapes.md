# Glaciated Landscapes (A-level Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## What glaciated landscapes are and why they matter
Glaciated landscapes are regions shaped directly or indirectly by the action of glacier ice. They include areas that are currently glaciated, such as valley glaciers and ice sheets, and formerly glaciated terrain that retains the erosional and depositional imprint of past ice coverage. Studying these landscapes at A-level focuses on understanding processes within a systems framework: inputs, outputs, stores and flows of mass and energy, and how those interactions produce distinctive landforms. Glaciated landscapes are important for physical geography because they provide clear examples of process–response relationships through time, they affect water supply and sediment budgets, and they are places where climate change has visible, measurable effects — from shrinking glacier tongues in the Alps to degrading permafrost in the Arctic. At human scales, glacial legacies influence settlement, tourism, resource extraction and hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods, so the topic bridges physical processes and people–environment interactions.

## Glaciers as systems: mass balance, feedbacks and thresholds
To analyse glaciated systems it helps to think in terms of glacier mass balance and system behaviour. A glacier’s mass balance records the difference between accumulation (snowfall, avalanching) and ablation (melting, sublimation, calving). Where accumulation exceeds ablation the glacier grows; where ablation is greater it retreats. Seasonal and long-term changes in mass balance are controlled by climate (temperature and precipitation) and can be linked to Quaternary-scale variations such as glacials and interglacials, historical events like the Little Ice Age, and the warming seen over the last century. Feedbacks are critical: for example, loss of ice reduces surface albedo so darker surfaces absorb more heat and accelerate melting, a positive feedback. Thresholds matter too; once a glacier shrinks below a critical size it may lose the capacity to sustain cold-based conditions and the whole system can shift to a new regime. The concept of equilibrium — when inputs and outputs are balanced — helps explain why some glaciers appear stable for long periods whereas others are highly dynamic.

## Glacier movement and erosional landforms
Glacier movement combines internal deformation of ice, basal sliding where melting creates lubrication, and sometimes sub-glacial bed deformation. Cold-based glaciers, frozen to their beds, move slowly and often preserve underlying rock, whereas warm-based glaciers at the pressure melting point can slide and erode vigorously. Erosional processes include abrasion, which polishes and striates bedrock as rock fragments in the ice grind over it, and plucking (or quarrying), where meltwater refreezes in fractures and pries blocks away as the glacier moves. The landscapes produced range from micro-features such as striations to macro-features like cirques (corrie basins), arêtes and pyramidal peaks formed where multiple glaciers carve back into a mountain, and U-shaped glacial troughs with truncated spurs and hanging valleys that tell the story of valley glacier erosion. Examples for UK study include the corries and U-shaped valleys of Snowdonia and the Scottish Highlands, while the high Alps illustrate the extreme sculpting possible under thick, active ice.

## Glacial and fluvioglacial transport and deposition
Glaciers transport sediment as supraglacial, englacial and subglacial loads; the type of transport affects the sediment’s characteristics. Glacial till is typically unsorted and unstratified, and its origin and behaviour can be expressed in different till types: lodgement till forms where ice deposits material beneath it, ablation till accumulates as ice melts out, and deformation till results from plastic deformation beneath fast-flowing ice. When the ice melts, material is released and reworked by meltwater, producing fluvioglacial deposits that are typically better sorted and stratified. The resultant landforms are diverse: moraines (terminal, recessional, lateral, medial, push) mark former ice margins, drumlins show streamlined, elongate forms that indicate ice flow direction, and roches moutonnées record differential erosion. Fluvioglacial features include eskers formed by subglacial meltwater channels, kames and kame terraces built from ice-contact sedimentation, and sandur (outwash) plains and varves in proglacial lakes. Kettle holes and kettle lakes are common where stranded ice blocks melt in outwash. Understanding these deposits and their sorting, shape and stratigraphy is essential for interpreting former glacial processes and reconstructing palaeo-ice flow.

## Periglacial processes and permafrost landscapes
Periglacial environments occur beyond the limits of glaciers where freeze–thaw processes and seasonal freezing dominate. These cold-climate processes produce patterned ground, ice wedge polygons, pingos, solifluction terraces and blockfields. Permafrost — ground that remains at or below 0°C for at least two consecutive years — can store large volumes of organic carbon in frozen soils and peat. When permafrost thaws, thermokarst landforms develop and previously locked carbon and methane can be released, creating potent climate feedbacks. Contemporary permafrost degradation is an urgent global issue; warming at high latitudes is occurring faster than the global average, with implications for infrastructure, ecosystems and greenhouse gas fluxes. The periglacial suite of features is therefore both a record of cold-climate processes and a barometer of environmental change.

## Human interactions, hazards and management
Glacial landscapes intersect with human activity in several ways. Glacial catchments supply drinking water and hydropower, provide aggregate resources such as sand and gravel, and attract tourism which can bring economic benefits but also environmental pressure. Conversely, human actions can exacerbate risks: extraction from glacial deposits or construction in valley bottoms can increase vulnerability to floods, and climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions is a primary driver of glacier retreat and permafrost thaw. Hazards associated with glaciated landscapes include glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), formed when moraine or ice-dammed lakes fail; these can cause catastrophic downstream impacts and have occurred in mountain ranges such as the Himalaya and Andes. Management responses combine monitoring (satellite and in situ), hazard mapping and land-use planning to avoid exposed development, engineering solutions (controlled drainage of dangerous lakes, stabilisation of moraine dams), and community-based early warning systems. Conservation measures can involve protecting glacial landforms, restoring vegetation on unstable slopes, and regulating tourism to reduce trampling and erosion. The sustainability of management must balance economic needs with risk reduction and the long-term resilience of ecosystems and communities.

## Fieldwork, methods and how to build evidence
Fieldwork is central to understanding glaciated landscapes and provides the primary data for independent investigations. A typical enquiry will start from a clear research question, then select methods suited to that question. For glacial studies this may include mapping landform distribution and orientation, measuring corrie dimensions or profiles of U-shaped valleys, sampling and sieving till or outwash sediments to analyse grain size and sorting, conducting till fabric analysis for ice-flow inference, and recording striation orientations. Modern fieldwork increasingly uses geospatial tools: GPS to locate features precisely, aerial photographs and digital elevation models (DEMs) to analyse valley cross-sections and long profiles, and GIS to compile and visualise spatial patterns such as moraine sequences or drumlin orientations. Quantitative analysis might involve calculating sediment size distributions, determining mass-balance components from accumulation and ablation measurements, or constructing and interpreting longitudinal profiles. Qualitative techniques can include photographic records, field sketches and interviews with local land managers about perceived environmental change or hazard experience. When planning fieldwork, sampling strategy must be justified (random, systematic or stratified), ethical and safety issues addressed, and constraints such as access and conservation status respected; in Wales, for example, sites in Snowdonia such as corries around Cwm Idwal and the Ogwen Valley provide accessible examples of glacial landforms, but many areas are protected and fieldwork must be sensitive to habitat and heritage concerns. Finally, fieldwork write-ups should show a clear chain from raw data to presentation, analysis, conclusion and reflection on limitations — the six stages of enquiry provide a helpful structure for both practical work and the independent investigation.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on glaciated landscapes requires precise use of specialist terminology, a clear structure that links processes to landforms and to human responses, and well-chosen, named case study evidence. Begin by defining key terms where appropriate (for example, explain ‘glacier mass balance’ or ‘periglacial’) and adopt a systems approach: identify inputs, transfers and outputs and then trace the causal chain that links processes to the landforms you are describing. Where a question asks for explanation, place emphasis on causality and mechanism (how does plucking create asymmetrical cliffs? why do eskers indicate former subglacial channels?). Where evaluation is required, weigh alternative explanations and show awareness of scale and time — note seasonal and Quaternary changes and identify thresholds or feedbacks (for example, how glacier retreat may alter sediment supply and valley form). Always use named examples and, where possible, local evidence from fieldwork to validate arguments; refer to specific valleys, corries or glacier systems to support general statements. If interpreting data or maps, describe patterns first and then explain them with processes and contextual knowledge. For management questions, show balance: explain the costs and benefits of engineering and non-engineering solutions, consider social and economic trade-offs, and assess the likely effectiveness and sustainability of measures. Diagrams and annotated sketches add clarity, but they must be relevant and fully integrated into your explanation. Time management is crucial: read the question carefully to identify command words, plan a brief answer structure before writing, allocate time for case study detail and a short evaluative concluding paragraph. Finally, use the specialised concepts highlighted in the specification — causality, equilibrium, feedback, resilience, interdependence and thresholds — to demonstrate geographical thinking and to link process-based explanation with wider environmental and social implications.
