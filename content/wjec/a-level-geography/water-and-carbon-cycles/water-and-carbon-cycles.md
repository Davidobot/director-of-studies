# Water and Carbon Cycles (global systems) (A-level Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: why the water and carbon cycles matter
The water and carbon cycles are foundational Earth systems that sustain life and shape environments at scales from a single plant to the entire planet. Studying them at A-level means thinking in terms of systems: inputs, stores, transfers and outputs, and recognising that these cycles are linked. The water cycle governs the distribution and timing of liquid water, snow and ice, and atmospheric moisture; the carbon cycle governs where carbon is stored and how it moves between atmosphere, oceans, soils, vegetation and rocks. Both cycles operate over widely differing timeframes — seconds for evaporation, years to centuries for soil carbon turnover, and millennia for sedimentary carbon burial — so a systems perspective and an appreciation of mass balance are essential. For exam answers you will need to explain processes, show how stores and flows vary through space and time, and evaluate human impacts and management options, illustrated with contemporary examples such as peatland degradation in upland Britain or Arctic permafrost thawing.

## Systems and mass balance: framing the cycles
A useful starting point is to treat each cycle as a system. In the water cycle, precipitation, evaporation and evapotranspiration are the main flows; stores include the atmosphere, surface water (rivers and lakes), groundwater, soil moisture, vegetation and the cryosphere. Mass balance is the simple but powerful concept that, over a given time period, the change in storage equals inputs minus outputs. For a drainage basin this is often expressed as precipitation minus evapotranspiration and runoff, with any residual indicating change in groundwater or soil moisture. In the carbon cycle, stores range from the atmosphere (as CO2), living biomass, soils and peat, to dissolved inorganic carbon in the oceans and vast geological reservoirs in fossil fuels and sedimentary rocks. Carbon mass balance might be framed in terms of inputs to the atmosphere (fossil fuel combustion, land-use change) balanced against sinks (ocean uptake, terrestrial sequestration). Understanding mass balance helps in explaining phenomena such as river flow variability, glacier mass gain and loss, or atmospheric CO2 accumulation.

## Catchment hydrology and river regimes
At the catchment scale the drainage basin is the appropriate system to analyse hydrology. Inputs are precipitation (its type, amount, intensity and duration); transfers include infiltration, overland flow, throughflow and groundwater flow; stores include interception by vegetation, soil moisture and groundwater; the main output is channel discharge to the sea. River regimes describe the seasonal and longer-term patterns of discharge; some rivers show simple regimes driven by seasonal snowmelt or monsoon rainfall, others are complex because geology, storage capacity and human land use interact. The storm hydrograph is a key tool: the shape of the rising limb, peak discharge and lag time are controlled by storm characteristics and basin attributes. A flashy hydrograph with a steep rising limb and high peak is associated with intense storms, urbanised catchments or compacted soils. By contrast, catchments with extensive storage, permeable geology and dense vegetation produce attenuated hydrographs with longer lag times.

## Precipitation processes, excess runoff and water deficit
Precipitation forms by air uplift and cooling, following orographic, frontal or convective mechanisms. The microphysics of cloud formation includes processes such as collision-coalescence and the Bergeron–Findeisen mechanism in mixed-phase clouds; these explain differences between warm tropical rain and snow-dominated precipitation in colder climates. Excess runoff occurs when precipitation rate exceeds the capacity of soils and vegetation to absorb water, or when snowmelt is rapid. Intense convective storms, prolonged frontal events, monsoon systems and sudden snowmelt can all generate high runoff and flood peaks. Humans amplify excess runoff through urbanisation, river basin mismanagement and deforestation, which reduce infiltration and increase surface flow. Conversely, deficits arise from meteorological factors such as prolonged drought, or from human causes including aquifer over-abstraction and unsustainable reservoir withdrawals. Artificial recharge, conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, demand management and alternative sources such as desalination are responses to perennial deficits, but each has costs and trade‑offs to consider.

## The global carbon cycle: pathways, stores and the ocean sink
Carbon pathways link terrestrial ecosystems, the atmosphere and oceans. On land, photosynthesis removes CO2 and stores carbon in biomass and soils; respiration and decomposition return carbon to the atmosphere. Rivers transfer terrestrial carbon to the oceans as dissolved and particulate organic carbon. In the oceans, physical processes such as diffusion and the biological pump move carbon between surface waters and deep ocean sediments, while carbonate chemistry governs how much CO2 the ocean can absorb. Human burning of fossil fuels and land‑use change have increased atmospheric CO2, upsetting the long-standing balance and driving climate change. Different biomes have very different carbon stocks: tropical rainforests hold large amounts of carbon in live biomass, whereas peatlands store exceptionally large carbon stocks per unit area in partially decomposed organic material. Temperate grasslands tend to store proportionately more carbon in soils than in vegetation. When peatlands are drained or burned the stored carbon is released, sometimes for decades after initial disturbance.

## Feedbacks and linkages between the water and carbon cycles
The two cycles are strongly interdependent. Increased atmospheric CO2 influences the energy budget, warming the atmosphere and increasing potential evapotranspiration, which alters precipitation patterns and intensifies the hydrological cycle. Warming drives glacier retreat and reduces cryospheric storage, increasing sea level through both thermal expansion and ice melt. Permafrost thaw is a prominent positive feedback: thawed soils decompose and release CO2 and methane, amplifying warming and further accelerating thaw. Ocean warming reduces the solubility of CO2 but can increase stratification and thereby affect the biological pump; at the same time, rising CO2 causes ocean acidification, with consequences for carbonate-secreting organisms and the ocean’s role as a carbon sink. These feedbacks often have threshold behaviour: a relatively small additional forcing can push a system past a tipping point, leading to rapid and sometimes irreversible change, so careful evaluation and uncertainty analysis are important in essays and synoptic responses.

## Human impacts, peatlands and management responses
Human activities modify both cycles at many scales. Land‑use change such as deforestation reduces terrestrial carbon uptake and often increases runoff and erosion. Peatland exploitation for agriculture, horticulture or fuel converts long-term carbon stores into atmospheric emissions and reduces water retention, increasing flood risk and drying peat further. In Wales and the UK, upland peatlands in places such as the Brecon Beacons and Snowdonia have been affected by drainage and burning; restoration projects that block drains and re-wet peat aim to restore carbon storage and improve hydrological buffering. River basin management must consider the full system: catchment-wide approaches such as reforestation, floodplain restoration and sustainable farmland practices can reduce peak flows and enhance carbon sequestration. At global scale, mitigation measures include reducing fossil fuel emissions, afforestation, protecting intact peat and forest ecosystems, and developing carbon capture technologies; adaptation measures for the water cycle include improved reservoir management, sustainable abstraction policies and investment in green infrastructure. Management choices always involve trade-offs and considerations of equity, cost and long-term sustainability.

## Exam technique
When answering structured questions and extended responses on the water and carbon cycles, adopt a systems approach. Start by defining key terms — system, mass balance, stores, fluxes, evapotranspiration — and then describe processes clearly. For data-response questions include reference to the figure or diagram, label components of a system, and interpret trends with reference to causes and timescales. Use a simple mass-balance statement when appropriate (for example, inputs minus outputs equals change in storage) and perform unit conversions or straightforward calculations carefully, showing working. For extended essays, organise your answer into clear paragraphs: explain processes, provide contemporary examples (local examples such as UK peatland restoration or a named catchment like the Severn to illustrate regime or management points), evaluate impacts and management options, and end with a balanced judgement that reflects uncertainties and trade-offs. Integrate the specialised concepts required by the specification — causality, feedback, equilibrium, thresholds, resilience and sustainability — and demonstrate how they connect both cycles. Where possible, include a labelled sketch (for example, a drainage basin diagram, a storm hydrograph annotated with controls, or a schematic of carbon fluxes) as this communicates systems thinking concisely. Finally, use precise geographic vocabulary, quantify where you can, and ensure any claims are substantiated with evidence or logical explanation; examiners reward clarity of argument and critical evaluation as much as factual knowledge.
