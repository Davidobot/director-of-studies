# Fieldwork & Independent Investigation (NEA skills) (A-level Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview and purpose of fieldwork in this specification
Fieldwork is central to WJEC / Eduqas A-level Geography. It is not an optional extra but a compulsory element that develops the practical, analytical and evaluative skills required to "think like a geographer". Across the full A‑level course learners must undertake the equivalent of at least four days of out‑of‑classroom fieldwork: two days during the AS phase and a further two days during the A2 phase. This programme of field activity must include both physical and human geography contexts. Fieldwork supplies the primary data and first‑hand observation that underpin the Independent Investigation (Unit 5), which is the NEA element worth 20% of the final A‑level and assessed out of 80 marks. In practice this means fieldwork should be planned and taught, not left to last minute trips; fieldwork days are intended as active learning opportunities from which you will develop research questions, test methods and build a robust evidence base for the NEA.

## Planning fieldwork and choosing an enquiry focus
Good fieldwork begins with place and purpose. Centres are encouraged to start fieldwork in Units 1 and 2 because the local focus of Changing Landscapes and Changing Places provides manageable, rich environments for enquiry. A useful approach is to explore the learner’s home place or place of study and a contrasting place, then broaden to regional or global examples as required. One or more of the fieldwork days must provide the starting point for the NEA, so when selecting a field site think ahead: the site should allow clear, measurable questions to be framed, support both primary and secondary data collection where needed, and be feasible within time, safety and logistical constraints. Typical enquiry foci include beach profile change and sediment characteristics for coastal work, corrie or valley form and depositional features for glacial study, river catchment hydrology or urban rebranding and retail change for human geography investigations. Early planning should include a risk assessment, ethical considerations for human research (consent for interviews or questionnaires), and potential access or permission issues.

## The six‑stage enquiry and structure of the Independent Investigation
The specification adopts a six‑stage enquiry cycle and the NEA write‑up must be structured to follow it. The stages are: context and planning; data collection; presentation and display; analysis and interpretation; conclusions; evaluation. The NEA report must begin with a concise abstract (up to 250 words) that states the research question and the link to the specification, followed by the six sections. Assessment is closely mapped to these parts: AO1 (knowledge and understanding) is assessed primarily through the contextual planning (10 marks), AO3 (fieldwork and practical skills) through methods, data presentation, analysis and conclusions (50 marks spread across those sections), and AO2 (analysis/evaluation) largely through the evaluation (20 marks). The total NEA mark is 80. The required word length is guidance of 3,000–4,000 words for the main body of the investigation; the abstract and appendices are excluded from this total. The report should be typed in a clear font, size 11, with 1.5 spacing, pages numbered and candidate/centre numbers in the header or footer.

## Quantitative and qualitative skills: collecting and analysing data
A balanced NEA demonstrates competence in both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative skills you will commonly use include accurate cartographic referencing, distance and area calculations, systematic sampling procedures, descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, interquartile range), basic inferential or relational statistics where appropriate (scatter plots, lines of best fit, Spearman rank or Chi‑square for categorical data), and the use of geospatial technologies such as GPS, GIS and remote sensing. Qualitative skills are just as important and include structured and semi‑structured interviews, participant observation, photo‑elicitation and content analysis of textual or media representations of place. Practical fieldwork often mixes both types: for example, a beach profile transect provides numeric data to plot gradients and grain size distributions, while a short interview with a local business owner can illuminate perceptions of coastal management. Sampling strategy should be justified and appropriate: random, stratified or systematic sampling each have different uses and limitations; a pilot study is an inexpensive way to test your methods and refine your sampling before committing to the full field visit.

## Presenting results, interpretation and critical evaluation
Effective NEA reporting moves beyond descriptive presentation into thoughtful interpretation and justified conclusions. Data presentation must be appropriate and clear: maps should be fully labelled (scale, northing, legend), graphs should be chosen to suit the data, and GIS outputs can add spatial depth if they are used with care and explained. Raw data should be retained and included in appendices rather than in the word count. Analysis must link evidence to theory and to the wider specification concepts such as systems, feedbacks, thresholds, interdependence and sustainability. Conclusions should synthesise main findings in relation to the research question and the theoretical background given in the introduction; they should not simply repeat results. The evaluation is heavily weighted and is where you demonstrate critical thinking: comment on accuracy, reliability and validity of primary and secondary data, sampling limitations, temporal constraints, measurement error and any biases. Offer specific, plausible improvements and identify opportunities for further research. If part of the data was gathered as collaborative work, you must state your individual role clearly and indicate which data were common to the group and which you collected or processed yourself.

## Independence, teacher guidance, authentication and moderation
The NEA must be the candidate’s individual work. Teachers have a defined and limited role. They may provide broad parameters, discuss initial ideas, advise on health and safety and give general feedback, but they must not supply titles, give detailed corrections on drafts, provide model answers or supply primary or secondary data not collected by the candidate. Any assistance beyond general guidance must be recorded on the Geography Independent Investigation Form and taken into account when marking. Candidates and teachers must sign authentication declarations; the teacher’s signature confirms that the work submitted is the candidate’s own, apart from permitted collaboration. Centres are required to verify that learners have undertaken the required fieldwork and must submit a fieldwork declaration to WJEC by the stated deadline. Internal standardisation is required where more than one teacher marks in a department. Moderation procedures involve submission of a ranked sample and the Independent Investigation forms; teachers should annotate scripts to show how marks were applied against the mark grid. Familiarity with the mark bands and supplying clear annotation are important to avoid postcode or administrative queries from moderators.

## Practical tips and common pitfalls
Begin early and plan your NEA progressively rather than leaving the write up until the end. Choose a research question that is clear, focused, manageable and directly linked to the specification content; overly broad or vague questions are the most common cause of lost marks. Pilot your methods to identify problems and to refine sampling. Be explicit about the difference between primary and secondary data, and be cautious about over‑relying on secondary sources; interpret secondary data critically. When using statistics, choose techniques you understand and can justify; simple, well‑explained analysis is better than complex techniques applied incorrectly. Keep raw data and a fieldwork log; include a labelled map showing sampling locations and a short description of your role if any data were collected in groups. In the evaluation avoid generic statements; be specific about how measurement error, sampling bias or temporal constraints affected particular results and suggest concrete improvements. Ensure referencing is complete and consistent (Harvard or another conventional system) and remember that the abstract and appendices are excluded from the word count but must be relevant and concise.

## Exam technique
Approach the NEA as an assessed enquiry, not as an extended essay. Structure your written investigation clearly under the six enquiry headings required by the specification and use the abstract to summarise the question, methods and main finding succinctly. Allocate time in proportion to the mark weighting: the evaluation is worth a substantial portion of the total mark so give it careful attention. Use clear, labelled figures and tables within the text to support explanations rather than to hide analysis; caption every figure and refer to it in the prose. When writing methods and results, be concise and precise: describe sampling rigs, instruments and measurement units, and report raw results in appendices. In the analysis, link evidence to geographical concepts and to the specification vocabulary such as systems, feedback, resilience, thresholds and interdependence. For the evaluation, be honest and analytical; examiners reward candidates who identify weaknesses and propose realistic remedial steps. Before submission check that the formatting rules have been followed, the word limit is respected, the Geography Independent Investigation form is complete and signed, and that all raw data and permissions are stored securely. Finally, remember that originality of thought, clarity of argument and a clear demonstration of fieldwork competence are the best ways to maximise NEA marks.
