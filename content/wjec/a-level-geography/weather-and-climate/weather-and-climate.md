# Weather and Climate (UK and global change) (A-level Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction and key concepts
Weather and climate are closely related but distinct ideas: weather describes the short-term state of the atmosphere (hours to days), while climate is the long-term average of weather patterns over decades and longer. In studying weather and climate you are working with a linked system that spans scales from local microclimates to global circulation. The WJEC / Eduqas specification expects you to think in systems terms: inputs, stores, transfers and feedbacks, and to use the specialised concepts of causality, equilibrium, feedback, threshold, risk, resilience, mitigation, adaptation, interdependence and sustainability. Practically this means you must be able to explain why a particular weather pattern arises (causality), how the atmosphere responds (feedbacks and equilibrium), what might push the system past a tipping point (threshold) and what people can do to reduce harm (mitigation and adaptation).

## Global controls on climate and the tricellular model
Large-scale climate patterns are set by the unequal heating of the Earth by the sun and by the way the atmosphere and oceans transport that energy. Solar heating is greatest near the equator, driving the Hadley, Ferrel and Polar cells of the tricellular circulation. Warm air rises in the tropics near the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), creating low pressure and heavy convectional rainfall. Air moves polewards aloft, cools and descends in the subtropics to form high-pressure belts, then returns at the surface as trade winds. Mid-latitude westerlies and polar easterlies complete the circulation. The pattern of pressure belts and prevailing winds, combined with ocean currents such as the North Atlantic Drift, continentality and altitude, produces the broad distribution of climate types across the planet.

Understanding the tricellular model is useful because it explains the distribution of deserts under subtropical highs, the wet equatorial belt and the stormy mid-latitudes. It also helps explain seasonal changes: the ITCZ migrates with the thermal equator, so regions close to its annual movement experience pronounced wet and dry seasons. You should be able to describe these processes, name the major circulation cells and link them to climate types.

## Major climate types, monsoons and seasonal systems
Climatic classification recognises several major types with distinctive temperature and precipitation regimes. Tropical rainforest climates are hot and wet year-round, savannas show a strong wet–dry season driven by ITCZ migration, mid-latitude climates can be temperate with variable precipitation, and polar regions are cold and dry. Monsoon climates are a particularly important seasonal phenomenon: intense summer heating of continental interiors reverses wind direction so moist oceanic air is drawn inland, producing heavy seasonal rainfall. The South Asian monsoon is the classic example: in summer the Indian subcontinent heats, low pressure develops and air flows in from the Indian Ocean bringing widespread rains; in winter the circulation reverses and dry conditions prevail. Monsoons are sometimes amplified or weakened by broader ocean–atmosphere phenomena such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

When explaining climate types you should link the characteristics (temperature, precipitation, pressure patterns) to the controlling processes: insolation, oceanic currents, prevailing wind direction, continentality and altitude. Remember to use the language of systems and flows (inputs, outputs, stores) and to show how seasonal shifts in the ITCZ or monsoon winds produce marked annual cycles.

## The climate and weather of the UK: air masses, the jet stream and regional contrasts
The UK has a temperate maritime climate with large regional contrasts. The major reason for the mild, relatively wet climate of western Britain (including Wales) is the Atlantic influence: prevailing south-westerly and westerly air masses bring moist, mild air from the North Atlantic. The North Atlantic Drift (a surface expression of the North Atlantic current) transfers heat northwards, moderating winter temperatures around north-western Europe. The UK’s weather is strongly influenced by the passage of depressions and fronts in the mid-latitude westerlies; anticyclones (high-pressure systems) bring more settled conditions.

Air masses that commonly affect the UK include polar maritime (cool, moist and unstable), tropical maritime (warm and moist), polar continental (cold and dry, more important in winter), and arctic maritime or continental variants that can bring cold snaps. The jet stream — a fast-flowing ribbon of air in the upper troposphere — is central to UK weather variability. When the jet stream is strong and zonal it drives rapid west-to-east movement of depressions; when it weakens or becomes meridional, large meanders produce blocking patterns that can bring prolonged wet spells, droughts, heatwaves or cold outbreaks. For exam answers you should be able to explain how jet stream position and amplitude change the frequency, intensity and location of storms and anticyclones over the UK.

## Extreme weather, variability and climate drivers (ENSO, feedbacks, thresholds)
Extreme weather events arise from normal atmospheric processes pushed to high intensity or persistence, often combined with vulnerable human systems. ENSO is a key driver of interannual climatic variability: El Niño conditions in the tropical Pacific tend to alter global circulation, shifting storm tracks and changing patterns of rainfall and temperature in many regions, with consequences for the UK and Europe that can include milder winters or altered storminess. Other drivers include the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic amplification, which can influence European weather patterns.

Feedbacks and thresholds are central to understanding risk. Arctic amplification — faster warming in the Arctic — weakens temperature gradients between high and mid latitudes which may alter the jet stream and produce more persistent weather states. Positive feedbacks, such as permafrost thaw releasing methane and carbon dioxide, can accelerate warming. Thresholds are critical values beyond which change becomes abrupt or self-reinforcing; examples include the potential breakdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation or rapid ice-sheet collapse, both of which would have major global and regional climate consequences.

When you answer questions on extremes and variability, link physical causes to human impacts: consider exposure, vulnerability and resilience. Use recent, contemporary examples to illustrate trends in weather extremes and changing vulnerability, and explain the mechanisms (e.g. how warmer sea surface temperatures can enhance storm intensity).

## Urban climates and atmospheric quality
Urban areas create distinctive microclimates through the urban heat island effect, altered surface energy balances and changes to urban roughness and drainage. Urban materials absorb and retain heat; paved and impermeable surfaces reduce evapotranspiration; building form traps heat and modifies wind flow. As a result cities can be several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas, with impacts on energy demand, health (heat stress) and local convective rainfall patterns.

Air pollution issues are another urban-scale concern. Particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds combine under sunlight to produce photochemical smog; acid deposition can affect vegetation and buildings. Urban climate and air quality are linked: heat intensifies photochemical reactions, and stagnant conditions associated with high pressure can concentrate pollutants. Management strategies include green infrastructure (urban trees, green roofs) to reduce temperate extremes and particulate concentrations, low-emission zones, and planning measures to reduce transport emissions. In exams you should be ready to explain both physical mechanisms and the socio-political measures used to mitigate urban climatic and pollution impacts.

## People, climate change and the future: mitigation and adaptation
Climate change presents both hazards and long-term shifts in climatic baselines. Anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases are altering the energy balance of the atmosphere, with consequences such as increased mean temperatures, shifts in precipitation patterns, sea-level rise and ocean acidification. Managing these changes requires a twofold approach. Mitigation aims to reduce the size of future changes by cutting emissions and switching to low-carbon energy systems, while adaptation reduces vulnerability to the changes already underway through planning, infrastructure and behavioural change.

Mitigation examples range from international agreements that set emissions targets to national energy policies promoting renewables and carbon budgets. Adaptation examples include coastal managed realignment, flood warning systems and improvements to drainage, changes to building regulations to cope with heat or elevated flood risk, and urban greening to reduce heat and surface runoff. At exam level, you must be able to evaluate a range of strategies at local, national and international scales and discuss trade-offs: mitigation has long-term global benefits but can be politically and economically challenging; adaptation is essential to reduce current risk but may be costly and unequal in outcome.

A special emphasis of the specification is the idea of tipping points and thresholds. Discuss plausible tipping points (e.g. permafrost carbon release, major ice-sheet loss) and the cascading consequences for global climate, ecosystems and human systems. Relate these to risk, resilience and sustainability and show how both mitigation and adaptation fit into a policy toolkit.

## Measuring, modelling and evidence
Robust evidence underpins all interpretation of weather and climate. Instrumental records provide direct measurements of temperature, precipitation and other variables for the recent past, while proxies such as tree rings, ice cores and sediment records extend our knowledge further back in time. Climate models simulate the Earth system and are tested against observations; they are essential tools for exploring future scenarios under different emissions pathways. In answers you should be precise about the types of evidence used to detect change, and be prepared to explain uncertainties and the importance of multiple lines of evidence when making claims about climate change and extremes.

## Exam technique
To score highly in WJEC/Eduqas questions on weather and climate you must combine knowledge with applied explanation and contemporary examples. Start extended answers with a clear definition of terms and a brief statement of the processes you will discuss. Always use system language where appropriate: identify inputs, stores, transfers and feedbacks, and explicitly name specialised concepts (e.g. feedback, threshold, resilience). For case-study questions, include specific contemporary examples and locate them in scale and context — e.g. "Storm Desmond (December 2015) produced record river flows in Cumbria because of prolonged Atlantic rainfall linked to a strong westerly jet stream and saturated catchments." When asked to evaluate management, weigh strengths and weaknesses across scales and consider social equity.

In data-response questions, describe the data before you interpret it: note trends, anomalies and scale. Relate the evidence to physical mechanisms and, where relevant, human systems. For essays, structure your response with short paragraphs that each make a single point supported by evidence and linked to the question. Use the command words carefully: "explain" requires causes and processes, "assess" requires judgement and balance, and "evaluate" asks for a reasoned conclusion that weighs evidence.

Practice exam-style questions under timed conditions and memorise two or three well-prepared, contemporary case studies (one UK-focused, one international and one illustrating mitigation/adaptation) so you can apply them quickly. Finally, always include scale in your discussion — show how local microclimates, regional circulation and global climate change interconnect — and conclude by summarising your argument and its bearing on specialised concepts such as risk, resilience and sustainability.
