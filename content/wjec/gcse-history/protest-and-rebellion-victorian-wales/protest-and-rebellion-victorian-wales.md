# Protest and rebellion in Victorian Wales (Merthyr, Rebecca, Chartism, Tithe) (GCSE History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Background: change, industrialisation and grievance in nineteenth‑century Wales
The period c.1830–c.1891 in Wales was one of dramatic economic and social change. Rapid industrialisation in the south, centred on ironworks and collieries, brought large numbers of people to towns such as Merthyr Tydfil and the Rhondda valleys. Elsewhere, rural Wales still lived under older patterns of landownership, tenant farming and church tithes. These different economies created different pressures: urban workers faced long hours, low pay and dangerous conditions, while rural communities struggled with insecure tenancies, tithes payable to the established Church and poor infrastructure such as expensive toll roads. Political reform in Britain—growing demands for representation, the spread of radical ideas and the shortfall between expectations and opportunities—made the language of protest more common. Understanding the protests and rebellions of Victorian Wales means seeing how economic hardship, local grievances and national politics combined to produce direct action, organised agitation and occasional violence.

## The Merthyr Rising, 1831: an urban explosion of anger
The Merthyr Rising of May–June 1831 was a concentrated outbreak of radical action in an industrial community. Merthyr Tydfil had grown into one of the biggest iron-producing towns in Britain; with that growth came overcrowding, disease and recurrent disputes over wages. Tensions escalated after poor harvests, unemployment and local court decisions that appeared to favour the ironmasters. Workers organised through political unions and met to demand reforms. Confrontations at the Court of Requests and at the Castle Inn turned into mass demonstrations and the occupation of local symbols of power, including a brief seizure of Penydarren House. The authorities responded with troops. The most famous casualty of the rising was Richard Lewis, better known as Dic Penderyn, who was executed after being convicted of stabbing a soldier. Public debate about Dic’s guilt and the harshness of the authorities made him a martyr in Welsh memory. The Merthyr Rising had immediate consequences: it exposed deep social divisions, provoked prosecutions and repression, but also helped to stimulate wider discussions about the treatment of industrial workers and the need for political reform.

## The Rebecca Riots, 1839–1843: rural protest against tolls, tithes and injustice
The Rebecca Riots began in west and mid‑Wales as a rural movement directed at the tollgates that blocked movement on roads and imposed heavy charges on poor farmers and labourers. Many tolls were operated by turnpike trusts and the costs were particularly resented by smallholders and tenants who depended on moving goods and animals. The rioters adopted a theatrical form of disguise: men dressed as women and called themselves “Rebecca and her daughters”, invoking a biblical image used to justify communal action and cloak identities. Attacks on gates such as the tollgate at Efailwen in 1839 became symbolic moments. The movement widened to include protests against landowner power, tithes and the practices of the Poor Law and workhouses; the breakout at the Carmarthen workhouse in 1843 showed how the riots could intersect with other forms of rural grievance. The authorities eventually set up a Commission of Enquiry; the Commission’s findings led to changes in the management of turnpikes and some relief on tolls. The Rebecca Riots are important because they show how rural communities could organise, use symbolic protest, and secure partial reforms without necessarily seeking national revolution.

## Chartism in Wales and the Newport Rising, 1839
Chartism was the major national working‑class movement of the 1830s and 1840s, calling for political reforms summarised in the People’s Charter: votes for all men, secret ballots, equal electoral districts and other measures to make Parliament accountable. In Wales, Chartist ideas combined with local conditions—unemployment, the impact of the 1834 Poor Law, and disappointment after the Great Reform Act—to produce strong support in industrial areas. Welsh Chartists were influenced by national figures and by local leaders. Differences in strategy and emphasis split leaders: William Lovett advocated moral force and education, while Feargus O’Connor preferred a more confrontational approach seeking mass demonstrations and universal agitation. The most dramatic moment in Welsh Chartism was the Newport Rising of November 1839, led by John Frost with Zephaniah Williams and William Jones. Hundreds of Chartists marched on Newport, intending to liberate arrested comrades and press their demands. The confrontation with troops and policemen at Newport’s Westgate Street ended in bloodshed; several Chartists were killed and many were arrested. The leaders were sentenced to death, then transported to Australia after public outcry and legal appeals. Chartism’s immediate aims were not achieved, but the movement helped politicise working people, promoted the language of rights and later contributed to the long‑term expansion of the franchise.

## The Blue Books (1847) and cultural consequences
In 1847 the British government published the Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the State of Education in Wales, commonly called the “Blue Books”. Intended to investigate schooling, the reports went far beyond education. The commissioners criticised the state of schooling but also attacked Welsh morals, the use of the Welsh language and the influence of Nonconformist chapels. The findings were widely read in Wales and provoked intense anger: many Welsh people saw the reports as an attack on national character and language. Cultural responses were swift and creative. The satirical play Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (The Treachery of the Blue Books), staged in 1854, epitomised how the Blue Books stimulated a Welsh backlash that strengthened Nonconformist and linguistic identity rather than undermining it. Far from leading to rapid Anglicisation, the Blue Books prompted Welsh communities to invest in their own schools and to defend the Welsh language and moral standards. In political terms, the episode fed into a growing sense of Welsh identity and contributed to later campaigns for educational and ecclesiastical reform.

## The Tithe War in Northeast Wales, 1886–1891: religion, rent and rural resistance
The Tithe War of the late 1880s and early 1890s was the culmination of long‑standing resentment in rural Wales about compulsory tithes paid to the Church of England. In predominantly Nonconformist areas the payment of tithes by tenant farmers to an Anglican clergy they did not support was seen as unjust. Economic pressures in the 1880s—falling livestock prices and agricultural hardship—made the burden even harder to bear. In places such as the areas around Llanarmon‑yn‑Iâl, farmers formed Anti‑Tithe Leagues and adopted collective strategies of refusal and passive resistance. Disturbances at Mochdre and Llangwm are examples of how protests flared into confrontations when authorities attempted to enforce collection, seize goods or secure evictions. The state often used the courts and police to respond, while campaigners sought political solutions. The Tithe War helped to push tithe reform onto the political agenda and was one strand in the wider campaign for Welsh disestablishment and land reform. Although the tithe system was not abolished immediately, the agitation contributed to a shift in public opinion and to later legislative measures that eased the immediate burden and changed rural land relations.

## Themes, continuity and significance across the protests
When taken together, these episodes reveal recurring themes of the Victorian Welsh protest tradition: a reliance on collective action, a spectrum of tactics from theatrical disguise and direct attacks to petitions and mass marches, and an interplay between local grievances and national politics. The protests were both expressions of immediate hardship and catalysts for longer‑term political and cultural change. Continuity can be seen in the way economic pressure—whether industrial wage cuts or falling farm prices—triggered unrest. Change is visible in outcomes: although many protests were suppressed in the short term, they contributed to debates about reform, to the growth of political organisation among working and rural people, and to a stronger sense of Welsh identity. Interpreting these events means balancing the argument that they were spontaneous eruptions of desperation with the evidence for organisation, leadership and political awareness. For teaching, it is useful to compare the social composition of participants, the role of charismatic individuals and the responses of state and local elites, and to consider how memory and myth (for example, Dic Penderyn as martyr or Rebecca as symbol) shaped later Welsh nationalism.

## Exam technique
To succeed in exam answers on protest and rebellion in Victorian Wales, always start by addressing the question directly and using specific knowledge to support your answer. For “explain why” questions, structure your response by setting out two or three clear reasons, explaining each one and then linking it to the question—show how the reason led to protest rather than simply describing it. Use key examples such as the Merthyr Rising, the Newport Rising, the Rebecca gate attacks at Efailwen, the Blue Books controversy and incidents from the Tithe War to illustrate points and provide evidence. Apply historical concepts: explain causes and consequences, point out continuities and changes, assess significance and compare similarities and differences between rural and industrial protest. For source‑based questions, read the source carefully, consider its message, provenance and purpose, and compare it with your background knowledge to evaluate its reliability and utility. When asked to evaluate interpretations, identify the viewpoint, explain what evidence supports it, consider alternative explanations and reach a balanced judgement. Time management is essential: plan a brief outline before you write, allocate time for each part of the question, and leave a few minutes to check your response. Finally, learn and use key names, dates and places so your answers can be precise—examiners reward accuracy, relevance and clear argument backed by specific examples.
