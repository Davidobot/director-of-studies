# Owain Glyndŵr and the Welsh Revolt (GCSE History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Wales before the Revolt: the long-term context
By the late fourteenth century Wales was still shaped by the legacy of the Edwardian conquest of the late thirteenth century and the English system of Marcher lordships that followed it. Large areas of Wales were controlled by English lords and governed by laws and courts that often advantaged English interests. Welsh society remained chiefly rural, with a strong culture of kinship, bardic learning and local loyalties, but many Welsh people—both gentry and commoners—faced legal and economic disadvantages. The reign of Richard II brought periodic hope for negotiated settlements and patronage, but the deposition of Richard in 1399 and the accession of Henry IV created new political tensions. For many in Wales these national changes sharpened existing grievances about land, law and opportunities, setting the scene for rebellion when a respected native leader could unite a broad coalition of discontent.

## The man and his background: Owain Glyndŵr to 1400
Owain Glyndŵr was born around 1354 into a Welsh gentry family with links to several princely houses. His father, Gruffudd Fychan ap Gruffudd, claimed descent from the princes of Powys, while his mother was descended from other leading Welsh dynasties. Glyndŵr’s early life combined traditional Welsh lordship with exposure to English law and warfare: he spent time in London as a member of the Inns of Court and saw military service on the Anglo-Scottish frontier and at sea, serving under nobles such as the Earl of Arundel and later Henry Bolingbroke (the future Henry IV). He married Margaret Hanmer and established himself as lord of Sycharth, managing an estate and maintaining status among the Welsh gentry. This mixed background—rooted in native lineage but with English legal and military experience—helped him to command respect across different social groups.

## The outbreak of revolt and early successes, 1400–1402
The revolt was triggered by a mixture of personal grievance and wider social and national tensions. Owain’s quarrel with the powerful Marcher lord Reginald Grey over land and legal standing is commonly cited as the immediate spark: disputes over property and the denial of legal redress made the conflict public. Those personal grievances quickly merged with broader resentments about loss of status, economic hardship and the effects of Henry IV’s seizure of the throne from Richard II. Glyndŵr’s call to arms in 1400 found support from disaffected Welsh gentry, discontented peasants and men who resented the Marcher system. Early in the rebellion Glyndŵr achieved a string of impressive victories. He won the Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen in 1401 and in 1402 the Battle of Bryn Glas brought a decisive victory in which an English commander, Sir Edmund Mortimer, was captured and then switched allegiance, later marrying Glyndŵr’s daughter. These successes allowed Glyndŵr to consolidate control in large parts of mid and north Wales and to present himself as more than a local rebel.

## Government, diplomacy and the high point of the revolt
Between 1402 and about 1405 Glyndŵr moved from guerrilla war to the trappings of princely government. In 1404 he held an assembly at Machynlleth, often described as a Welsh parliament, where he was proclaimed Prince of Wales and enacted measures to govern Welsh territory. Harlech Castle became a centre of his administration and symbolised his attempt to build durable institutions. Glyndŵr also sought and secured foreign support. He opened negotiations with French rulers and in 1406 wrote the Pennal Letter to King Charles VI of France, seeking formal recognition of Welsh independence, military aid and the reorganisation of the Welsh church under a Welsh bishopric—matters that showed his political ambitions extended beyond mere local resistance. In 1405 Glyndŵr entered into alliances with English rebels and disaffected nobles through arrangements sometimes summarised as the Tripartite Indenture; these agreements envisaged a division of power in the British Isles and underscored the extent to which his cause could attract significant collaborators. At its height, therefore, the Glyndŵr movement combined military success, administrative reform and international diplomacy, creating a serious challenge to Henry IV’s regime.

## Why the revolt faltered and Glyndŵr’s later years
After 1405 the rebellion entered a period of strain. Henry IV and his commanders reacted with sustained military force, while the English crown worked to isolate Glyndŵr politically by co-opting or suppressing potential allies among the Welsh gentry. Significant defeats, such as the English victory at Pwll Melyn in 1405, and the long struggle to hold fortified places weakened Glyndŵr’s position. Harlech Castle, besieged and eventually taken by English forces in 1409, was a major blow; its fall, together with mounting material difficulties, eroded the territorial base of the revolt. From about 1409 onwards Glyndŵr reverted increasingly to hit-and-run warfare and small-scale resistance rather than holding territory. He reportedly refused a royal pardon in 1411 and continued to be a focus for guerrilla raids, but by the second decade of the fifteenth century his movement had lost cohesion. The final years of Owain Glyndŵr’s life are murky: he disappears from the documentary record and is believed to have died between about 1415 and 1416. His actual place of burial remains unknown, which contributed to the enduring aura of mystery around him.

## Legacy, memory and significance in Welsh history
Owain Glyndŵr’s immediate political goal—establishing a lasting and independent Welsh state—was not achieved, and the revolt did not overturn English rule. Yet the long-term significance of Glyndŵr is substantial. He became a powerful symbol of Welsh resistance and national identity. Contemporary Welsh poets celebrated him, while English chronicles often portrayed him as a dangerous rebel; over time these contrasting images fed different historical interpretations. In later centuries Glyndŵr was central to Welsh nationalism and cultural revival, celebrated in literature, song and political rhetoric. The Pennal Letter and the Machynlleth parliament, whether viewed as bold assertions of independence or as pragmatic wartime acts, have been used by historians and by national movements to argue for aspects of Welsh autonomy. In terms of continuity and change, Glyndŵr’s revolt exposed the limits of English control in the Marches, prompted harsher and then more conciliatory policies, and left a cultural legacy that helped shape later ideas of Welsh identity.

## Reading the evidence: sources and interpretations
Students must handle a range of source types when studying Glyndŵr: English administrative records, royal letters and proclamations, Welsh bardic poetry and genealogies, foreign diplomatic correspondence (including the Pennal Letter), and physical evidence from sites like Sycharth and Harlech. Each category of source has strengths and weaknesses. English records often give detailed information about troop movements, pardons and legal actions, but they are written from the perspective of a government trying to stamp out rebellion and may exaggerate Glyndŵr’s brutality or minimise Welsh grievances. Bardic poetry and Welsh chronicles present a very different picture, celebrating Glyndŵr and emphasising the justice of his cause; these are invaluable for understanding Welsh support and contemporary perceptions but can be highly stylised and propagandistic. Foreign letters and treaties reveal Glyndŵr’s diplomatic reach but must be read in the context of wider Anglo-French rivalry. When answering source-based questions, students should consider provenance, purpose and tone, compare sources against their own knowledge, and be alert to what is left out as well as what is recorded.

## Exam technique
To do well on Glyndŵr questions in WJEC/Eduqas papers, build answers that combine specific factual knowledge with historical explanation and source-aware analysis. For knowledge and explanation questions, start with a clear topic sentence that answers the question directly, then develop two or three developed points using precise dates, events and individuals—such as the dispute with Reginald Grey, the victories at Mynydd Hyddgen and Bryn Glas, the Machynlleth parliament of 1404 and the Pennal Letter of 1406—and explain why each point matters to the argument. For source questions always address provenance: who produced the source, when and why. Use the source to support an argument but balance it with your own contextual knowledge, pointing out omissions, bias or exaggeration. In evaluation questions compare interpretations: explain how different historians or sources might emphasise either Glyndŵr’s statesmanship and political programme or his resort to violence and opportunism, and give reasons for these differences. Time management is crucial: spend the first few minutes planning, leave material time for a concluding judgement that directly answers the question, and when practising, draft sample essays and source analyses to build fluency. Practice using the key second-order concepts of cause and consequence, continuity and change, and significance to structure longer responses; examiners value clear, evidence-based explanations that go beyond narrative to show genuine historical understanding.
