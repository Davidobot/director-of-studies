# Russia and the Soviet Union c.1861–c.1953 (GCSE History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Background: the late Tsarist state and the emancipation of 1861
The story begins with a Russia that was overwhelmingly rural, autocratic and socially rigid. The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 under Alexander II was the most important single reform of the nineteenth century because it legally freed millions from hereditary bondage and aimed to modernise the empire. In practice emancipation left many peasants with small, uneconomic allotments and heavy redemption payments; rural poverty and periodic famines continued to shape popular attitudes. The state remained autocratic, with power concentrated in the Tsar and his bureaucracy, while the economy gradually industrialised from the 1880s under ministers such as Witte. New railways, factories and a growing urban working class changed social relations and created new political pressures. Intellectual life and political debate flourished among students, the intelligentsia and some liberal elites, but the regime resisted meaningful political reform. These long-term tensions—economic modernisation without corresponding political opening—help to explain why Russia proved vulnerable to revolutionary change in the early twentieth century.

## Social tensions, revolutionary ideologies and the 1905 crisis
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a variety of political movements developed. Populists, liberal reformers, and Marxist socialists all offered different answers to Russia’s problems. Industrial growth produced large factory towns and a politically conscious working class; peasants remained central to the agrarian economy and to any prospect of stability. The humiliating defeat in the Russo–Japanese War of 1904–1905 helped to trigger the 1905 Revolution, of which Bloody Sunday—when peaceful protesters were fired on by troops in St Petersburg—became a symbol. The tsarist regime’s response combined limited concession and repression. The October Manifesto promised a Duma (parliament) and civil liberties, but the Tsar and his ministers limited the Duma’s power and kept essential autocratic control. Between repression and reform, dissatisfaction was contained only temporarily; the events of 1905 revealed both the strength of popular unrest and the fragility of the old order.

## The fall of the Romanovs: World War I and 1917
Russia’s entry into the First World War placed extraordinary strain on the state. Military defeats, huge casualties, severe shortages and the collapse of transport and supplies undermined confidence in the Tsar and in the competence of the government. Nicholas II’s decision to take personal command of the army in 1915 and the influence of Rasputin over the royal family damaged the monarchy’s reputation. In Petrograd food riots and strikes in February 1917 combined with soldiers’ mutinies to topple the regime; the Tsar abdicated and a Provisional Government attempted to carry on. The Provisional Government continued the war and failed to address land reform, while soviets (workers’ and soldiers’ councils) gained influence. In October 1917, the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin and backed by figures such as Trotsky, seized power in what is often called the October Revolution. The Bolsheviks promised “peace, land and bread” and set about consolidating control amid civil war and foreign intervention.

## Civil War, War Communism and the New Economic Policy
Civil War from 1918 to about 1921 pitched the Red Army against a disparate White opposition and foreign intervention. Bolshevik victory owed much to organization, control of central Russia, and the leadership of Trotsky as Commissar for War. The Bolsheviks implemented War Communism to keep the Red Army supplied: grain requisitioning, nationalisation of industry and strict central control. War Communism brought severe economic disruption and widespread peasant resistance, culminating in revolts such as the Tambov rising. A catastrophic famine in 1921–22 contributed to the decision to change course. Lenin introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, a pragmatic retreat from centralisation that allowed limited private trade and small-scale private enterprise while the state retained control of the “commanding heights.” NEP stabilised the economy and reduced unrest, but it also revived disagreements within the Communist Party about socialism and strategy, setting the stage for later power struggles.

## Lenin’s legacy and Stalin’s rise to power
Lenin’s final illness and death in 1924 precipitated a power struggle in which Joseph Stalin, originally General Secretary of the Party, outmaneuvered rivals. Stalin used his administrative role to build support, marginalise opponents, and defeat figures such as Trotsky. By the late 1920s Stalin had consolidated unchallenged control. He launched a new course: rapid and uninterrupted industrialisation coupled with forced collectivisation of agriculture. This transformation was justified by Stalin as necessary to modernise the Soviet Union and to secure it against foreign threats, but it carried enormous human cost. Collectivisation aimed to replace peasant farming with large collective farms, and dekulakisation sought to eliminate wealthier peasants as a class. Resistance, repression and mismanagement contributed to mass starvation in parts of the USSR, most notably in Ukraine in 1932–33 where millions died. Simultaneously the state embarked on ambitious Five-Year Plans to increase heavy industry, steel and coal production; these plans achieved impressive industrial growth but relied on coercion, central planning and harsh labour regimes.

## The Great Terror, the cult of personality and social control
The 1930s saw the consolidation of Stalin’s personal authority through a combination of propaganda, mass mobilisation and systematic terror. The regime created a pervasive cult of personality around Stalin, while the secret police (NKVD) conducted purges, show trials and widespread arrests. Party members, military officers, intellectuals and ordinary citizens were accused of sabotage, espionage or counter-revolutionary activity. The purge of the Red Army’s officer corps in 1937–38, and the execution or imprisonment of many experienced commanders, had profound consequences for military preparedness. Millions were sent to the gulag labour camps where many perished. At the same time, Soviet society was reorganised under strict ideological controls: cultural life, education and youth organisations were harnessed to promote loyalty to the state and to the goals of rapid industrialisation. Despite the brutality, the USSR emerged in the 1930s with a vastly expanded industrial base that would later prove crucial in wartime.

## The Second World War and its aftermath
The Second World War transformed the Soviet Union. The Nazi–Soviet Pact of 1939 temporarily kept the USSR out of direct conflict with Germany and allowed territorial gains in Eastern Europe, but Hitler’s invasion in June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa) brought total war to Soviet soil. The initial months were catastrophic: huge losses, massive civilian suffering, and rapid German advances. Nevertheless, resilient defence, strategic mistakes by the Germans, harsh winters, and the mobilisation of Soviet industry and society turned the tide. Key events such as the defence of Moscow in 1941, the gruelling siege of Leningrad, and the decisive battle of Stalingrad in 1942–43 marked the turning point. Soviet human and material sacrifices were immense; the war killed millions of Soviet soldiers and civilians and devastated large regions. The wartime economy was transformed to an extraordinary degree: factories were relocated east of the Urals, production was centralised and the state prioritised military needs. After victory in 1945 the USSR emerged as one of the two pre-eminent world powers. In Eastern Europe the Red Army’s presence enabled the installation of communist governments, creating a Soviet sphere of influence. At home, post-war reconstruction was rapid but costly. The Soviet leadership rejected large-scale Marshall Plan aid and instead focused on reparations and extracting resources from occupied Germany, while central planning resumed to rebuild industry and housing.

## Stalin’s death (1953) and the legacy to c.1953
Stalin’s death in March 1953 ended an era defined by personal dictatorship, mass repression and rapid industrial transformation. By 1953 the Soviet Union was militarily powerful and territorially secure, but the economy remained centrally planned and consumer living standards lagged behind the West. Politically, the Communist Party dominated all aspects of life and dissent had been largely crushed during the purges. Ethnic minorities and deported peoples were a continuing issue, and wartime traumas and demographic losses influenced social policy. The immediate post-war years to 1953 consolidated Soviet control in Eastern Europe, hardened the Cold War rivalry with the West, and left a complex legacy: an industrialised superpower built at an enormous human cost, a rigid political system that tolerated little opposition, and a model that would shape global politics for decades. Understanding the period to 1953 therefore requires balancing the achievements of modernisation and wartime resilience with the reality of repression, human suffering and limited political freedom.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Russia and the Soviet Union, always show precise factual knowledge as the foundation of your argument and then link that knowledge explicitly to the question’s focus. For "describe" and "explain" questions give clear chronological detail and connect events to causes and consequences. For "how far" and "assess" essays set out a clear judgement at the start, develop balanced arguments with supporting evidence, and reach a conclusion that weighs the strengths of opposing interpretations. When working with sources, identify the content and what it shows, consider the provenance (who produced it and why), and assess reliability and usefulness in light of the question. For interpretation-based questions compare the view with other evidence you know: does it overstate or underplay causes, continuity or change? Use the historical concepts from the specification—continuity and change, cause and consequence, significance and similarity/difference—explicitly in your answers. Time management is essential: for a one-hour paper allocate time for reading and planning before writing, and for longer essays plan paragraphs that each make one main point supported by evidence and linked back to the question. Practising past-style questions under timed conditions will improve speed and clarity. Finally, avoid unsupported generalisations: examiners reward precise knowledge, clear analysis and sustained argument that consistently addresses the question.
