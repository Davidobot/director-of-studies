# Historical enquiry, source analysis and interpretations (WJEC NEA skills) (GCSE History WJEC / Eduqas)

## What the NEA and source work assess and why it matters
WJEC’s GCSE History puts historical enquiry, source analysis and interpretation at the heart of the course because these are the skills real historians use. The non-examination assessment (NEA) units — Unit 2 (on-screen, three hours) and Unit 4 (centre-marked, 4 hours 15 minutes) — require you to conduct a focused historical enquiry using a small set of provided items. In the examined units (Units 1 and 3) you will also be asked to analyse and evaluate sources and interpretations under timed conditions. Across the qualification you are assessed against four assessment objectives: knowledge (AO1), application of historical concepts (AO2), analysis and evaluation of sources and interpretations (AO3) and practical enquiry skills (AO4). Getting comfortable with these skills will help you make balanced, evidence-based judgements and show examiners the difference between knowing facts and using them historically.

## The stages of a successful enquiry: an approach you can use every time
Both NEA tasks follow a clear five-stage process that you should practise until it becomes second nature. First, gain a rapid overview: read the question, the timeline and the short narrative and use these to form a working hypothesis. This is your initial answer — a concise claim you will test. Second, review the items provided (sources and interpretations) and annotate them carefully, noting the content and any immediate strengths or weaknesses. Third, plan your response: decide which items support or challenge your hypothesis, and identify the areas where your own knowledge must be used to explain, contextualise or challenge the items. Fourth, develop the response: write clearly, integrating source analysis and contextual knowledge to reach a substantiated judgement. Finally, reflect: the NEA asks you to evaluate your own process and the confidence you have in your conclusion. Practice these steps under timed conditions so you can move efficiently between reading, planning, writing and reflecting.

## How to analyse a source: provenance, content, usefulness and reliability
When you meet a source — whether a government report, a letter, a chronicle or an image — start by unpacking provenance and content and then move to judgement. Provenance means the origin of the item: who produced it, when, where and for what audience or purpose. These details shape meaning. For example, a royal chronicle praising Rhys ap Gruffudd needs to be read differently from a Norman knight’s report; a French diplomatic letter supporting Glyndŵr’s claim has international motives you should consider. Content analysis describes what the source actually says or shows: summarise the key message, language, tone and any claims. After provenance and content, judge usefulness: what can this source help you understand about your question? A source can be highly useful for describing an event yet limited for explaining wider causes. Reliability is separate: a source might be useful but unreliable for certain claims because of bias, time of writing or restricted knowledge. Balance is achieved by corroboration: compare the source with other items and with your contextual knowledge. Use precise phrases such as “this source suggests… because…; however its reliability is limited by… because…”, and avoid asserting absolute truth. In practice, exam answers that discuss both provenance and content, and then evaluate usefulness and reliability with specific evidence, score strongly on AO3.

## Working with interpretations: assessing historians’ views and making your own judgement
Interpretations are historians’ explanations of the past and the NEA and exams expect you to treat them as arguments to be tested, not statements to be learned by rote. To evaluate an interpretation, identify its central claim, the evidence or reasoning offered, the perspective or motive behind it, and what it leaves out. For example, an interpretation that celebrates Genghis Khan as a bringer of stability should be weighed against evidence for devastation in cities like Bukhara and Samarkand; ask whether the historian uses archaeological, documentary or later sources and whether their context (political, cultural or disciplinary) shapes their view. When comparing two interpretations, look for agreements, different emphases and omissions. Good answers explain why one interpretation is more convincing for certain aspects of the question while noting that both may be partially true. Always bring in your own knowledge to test interpretations: contextual facts, chronology and cause-and-effect chains are powerful tools to confirm or refute a historian’s claim.

## Planning and writing the enquiry: structure, integration and illustration
A clear structure helps examiners follow your reasoning and awards marks for AO2 and AO3. Begin with a short introduction that sets the question in context and states your hypothesis. The main body should be organised thematically or by argument: each paragraph should begin with a clear point, support that point with a combination of item analysis and contextual knowledge, and then explain how this evidence supports or undermines your hypothesis. Integrate sources into your narrative rather than treating them as separate appendices; for example, you might write, “Source A (a 1402 bailiff’s letter) suggests X; this is credible because… and is supported by Source B, whereas Source C appears to be biased because…”. Use precise examples from your wider knowledge to explain significance: dates, names, events and consequences give authority. When you reach the conclusion, return to the initial hypothesis, summarise the strongest evidence for and against it, and indicate how confident you are. For NEA submissions you must also include a short reflective commentary on your process, explaining how you selected and used evidence and acknowledging limitations. Practise writing responses within the time limits and aim to leave a short period to proofread.

## Using second-order concepts to deepen answers: continuity/change, cause/consequence, significance and similarity/difference
WJEC expects you to use second-order historical concepts to shape analysis rather than simply to narrate events. Continuity and change involves showing what altered over the period and what remained the same; for example, in a study of Wales under the Tudor monarchs you might argue that legal and administrative structures changed significantly through the Acts of Union, while local cultural practices continued to shape daily life. Cause and consequence requires you to distinguish short-term triggers from long-term structural causes and to trace consequences across political, economic and social spheres. Significance asks you to weigh the importance of events or individuals: Owain Glyndŵr’s revolt can be judged important for Welsh national identity even if its immediate political success was limited. Similarity and difference are useful when making comparisons across regions or periods, such as contrasting the Mongol use of mobility and military organisation with Ottoman administrative centralisation under Süleyman. Use these concepts explicitly in sentences like “this demonstrates change because…”, or “while X was significant politically, its wider social impact was limited because…”.

## Practical classroom and revision tips tailored to WJEC tasks
To succeed you need both factual knowledge and practised skills. Use the specification topics as practice grounds: treat a source on the Black Death as an opportunity to link epidemiology with social reaction, or analyse a Nazi propaganda leaflet alongside testimony from 1943 to practise corroboration. For NEA practice, simulate the WJEC conditions: use an unseen set of four items (two sources and two interpretations per theme) and spend the first 30–45 minutes reading and annotating, the next 90–120 minutes writing, and the final 15–20 minutes reflecting and polishing. Keep a running checklist for source work in your notes: provenance, content, utility, reliability, corroboration and context. When revising, make concise knowledge grids (dates, causes, consequences, key people) for each topic so that you can rapidly deploy accurate facts to support your source evaluations. Remember the administrative rules: Unit 2 is completed on WJEC’s e-platform during a set window; Unit 4 requires engagement with two set themes and careful record of your process for moderation. Avoid malpractice by following centre guidance on collaboration and citation.

## Exam technique
Time management and clarity of argument win marks as consistently as factual accuracy. Read the question carefully and underline command words such as “how far”, “assess”, “explain” or “to what extent” — these tell you whether you must judge, explain causation or weigh significance. When analysing sources in timed papers, spend the first few minutes on provenance and then move quickly to evaluate usefulness and reliability, always linking back to the question. Use the language of evaluation: don’t just describe what a source says; explain why that content matters and what limits there are to using it as evidence. Make sure each paragraph contains a clear point, evidence (from sources and your own knowledge), and explanation of how this evidence answers the question. Explicitly use historical concepts where relevant, and if asked to compare interpretations, balance your discussion by showing both strengths and limitations and concluding which is more convincing and why. Leave five to ten minutes to proofread and to add any final piece of factual evidence that strengthens your conclusion. Practise past-style NEA tasks and timed source questions regularly so the processes of reading, annotating, planning, writing and reflecting become automatic — that fluency, more than anything else, raises your AO3 and AO4 marks.
