# The Third Reich: rise, policies and fall (GCSE History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction and background
The Third Reich refers to Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler from 1933 to 1945. To understand how it arose and why it collapsed, start with the political and social context of the Weimar Republic: a fragile democracy founded after Germany’s defeat in 1918, weakened by economic crisis, political fragmentation and the humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles. The global Great Depression from 1929 intensified unemployment and unrest, creating fertile ground for extremist movements. The National Socialist German Workers’ Party (Nazi Party) combined radical nationalism, anti‑communism and racist ideology with modern mass politics and skilful propaganda. Hitler’s appeal lay in promises to restore national pride, revive the economy and provide strong, decisive leadership. Remember that the rise of Nazism is best seen as the result of long‑term weaknesses in Weimar plus short‑term shocks; both structural causes and contingent events matter when explaining how the regime took power.

## How Hitler came to power
Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 was the outcome of political bargaining rather than outright electoral dominance. The Nazis were the largest single party in the Reichstag but lacked a parliamentary majority. Conservative elites and President Paul von Hindenburg believed they could control Hitler and use his popularity to stabilise the country. Once in office, Hitler used a combination of legal measures and extra‑legal intimidation to dismantle democratic institutions. The Reichstag Fire in February 1933 allowed the government to claim an emergency, suppress civil liberties and arrest communists. The Enabling Act of March 1933 gave the cabinet power to legislate without the Reichstag, effectively legalising dictatorship. From this point, the Nazi seizure of power (Gleichschaltung) remade Germany’s political, cultural and civic institutions to fit one party rule. When President Hindenburg died in August 1934, Hitler combined the presidency and chancellorship and secured the army’s oath of personal loyalty, cementing his position as Führer.

## Consolidation of power, 1933–1934
Consolidation involved neutralising rivals, centralising authority and creating the party state. The early months saw the banning of other parties, the dissolution or takeover of state parliaments, and the remodelling of civil service and local government to place loyal Nazis in charge. The Night of the Long Knives in June–July 1934 dramatised ruthless internal consolidation: Hitler ordered the purge of the SA leadership and other perceived opponents to reassure the army and conservative elites who feared the SA’s revolutionary ambitions. Security organisations such as the SS (Schutzstaffel) and the Gestapo expanded, becoming instruments of surveillance and terror. Gleichschaltung also meant the Nazification of media, culture and education: newspapers were censored, radio was used for mass propaganda, and teachers and youth organisations were pressured to teach and spread Nazi worldview. This period shows how the regime combined legal change, violence and persuasion to produce rapid political transformation.

## Racial and social policies, 1933–1939
Racist ideology was central to Nazi goals. The regime’s racial laws and social policies sought to create a Volksgemeinschaft — a supposedly unified national community purged of those defined as enemies. Anti‑Jewish legislation moved from exclusion to persecution. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped Jews of German citizenship and prohibited marriage and sexual relations between Jews and “Aryans,” formalising racial discrimination. Kristallnacht in November 1938, a violent pogrom against Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues, marked a decisive escalation and signalled state‑sponsored violence against Jews that pushed many towards emigration. Persecution also targeted Roma, people with disabilities, homosexuals, political opponents and other groups labelled “asocial.” Social policy aimed to reshape family life and gender roles: women were encouraged to give birth to more children through incentives like marriage loans and awards for large families, while at the same time some women entered the workforce as the economy remobilised. Youth programmes such as the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls sought to mould the next generation, combining social activities with political indoctrination.

## Religious and economic policies, 1934–1939
Relations with the churches were complex. The regime signed a Concordat with the Catholic Church in 1933 that promised protection for the Church’s rights, but the agreement was violated in practice as the state interfered with Catholic organisations and persecuted clergy. Protestant Christianity fractured under Nazi pressure, with some church leaders cooperating and others forming a Confessional Church in resistance. Economically, the Nazis pursued policies aimed at recovery and rearmament. Early measures included public works projects such as road building, measures to reduce unemployment and state support for industry. The level of success and the reasons for economic improvement are debated: public spending and military rearmament were significant, but so too were changing statistical definitions and increased labour control. The concept of autarky and the Four‑Year Plan under Göring from 1936 sought to prepare Germany for war by controlling resources and accelerating rearmament. Different ministers and advisers, notably Hjalmar Schacht and later Göring, promoted competing economic strategies, which illustrates the regime’s internal tensions over priorities.

## War, popular life, opposition and collapse, 1939–1945
The outbreak of war in 1939 brought both short‑term unity and long‑term stress to the regime. Early military victories reinforced Hitler’s standing, but total war gradually transformed German society. Conscription widened, rationing and labour controls intensified, and civilian life became increasingly dominated by military needs. Allied bombing campaigns from 1942 onwards inflicted devastating damage on cities and civilian morale, producing refugee flows and undermining normal social structures. Opposition existed throughout the period, though its effectiveness varied. Religious opponents such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemöller criticised regime injustices and paid with imprisonment; young resistors like the White Rose distributed leaflets; conservative elements in the military attempted to remove Hitler, most famously the July 20 plot of 1944, Operation Valkyrie, which failed and led to brutal reprisals. The Holocaust, the systematic genocide of Jews and other persecuted groups, was a central and defining crime of the regime. Initially implemented through exclusion, emigration pressure, ghettos and killing units, it culminated in the industrialised mass murder carried out at extermination camps in occupied Poland. By 1945 the combination of military defeat, economic collapse and the moral bankruptcy of the regime led to Germany’s unconditional surrender. The immediate aftermath saw occupation by Allied powers, the prosecution of major Nazi leaders at the Nuremberg Trials, and the start of denazification efforts intended to remove Nazi influence from public life.

## Denazification and legacy
Denazification was a policy pursued by the occupying powers to identify and remove active Nazis from positions of influence, to try key figures for war crimes, and to re‑educate the German population. Approaches varied between the Soviets, Americans, British and French, from summary measures and collectivised punishment in some areas to vetting lists and tribunals elsewhere. The Nuremberg Trials in 1945–46 established principles of international justice by prosecuting major leaders for crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Denazification had mixed results: some former Nazis were successfully excluded, many underwent re‑education, but practical needs during the Cold War and administrative difficulties meant that some former members were reintegrated into post‑war German society. The long‑term legacy of the Third Reich includes the moral, demographic and material devastation of Europe, the centrality of the Holocaust in modern memory, the division of Germany during the Cold War, and enduring debates about responsibility, ordinary perpetrators, and how societies remember and teach such crimes.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on the Third Reich, be clear about the task: identify whether the question asks you to explain causes, assess significance, compare continuity and change, or evaluate source material. For source questions, first summarise what the source says, then analyse its provenance — who produced it, when and why — and finally evaluate usefulness and limitations. In extended answers, structure your response with a clear introduction that sets out your argument, several development paragraphs each with focused evidence and explanation, and a concluding paragraph that directly answers the question. Use specific examples—such as the Enabling Act, Night of the Long Knives, Nuremberg Laws, Kristallnacht, Kinder, Küche, Kirche policies, the Four‑Year Plan, Allied bombing, the White Rose and the July 20 plot—to support points and show depth of knowledge. Link evidence to second‑order concepts: explain causes and consequences, assess significance by weighing short and long‑term effects, and show continuity and change over the period. For Unit 2 enquiries, follow the stages of a historical investigation: get an overview, form a clear hypothesis, use the sources to test and refine that hypothesis, plan your answer around the strongest evidence, and finish with critical reflection on the limits of the evidence and the strength of your conclusion. Finally, manage your time, aim for clarity and precision in writing, and remember that evaluation and judgement—explaining how and why interpretations differ—often gains the higher marks.
