# Wales and the early Tudors (Acts of Union) (GCSE History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Background: Wales and the late medieval legacy
By the mid-fifteenth century Wales carried the long imprint of the Edwardian conquest and the power of the Marcher lords who ruled border territories with considerable independence. Welsh society remained largely rural and Welsh-speaking, with regional variations between the more Anglicised south-east and the more Gaelic-influenced north and west. The Wars of the Roses had produced opportunities for ambitious families, and the Tudor dynasty itself had Welsh roots: Henry Tudor’s claim to the throne drew on his descent from the Welsh Tudors of Penmynydd. These political and social legacies help explain why the Tudors took a distinctive approach to governing Wales. Understanding the Acts of Union requires seeing them against this background of fragmented lordships, a Welsh gentry sometimes loyal to local traditions, and a Crown determined to secure the border and create a more stable, governable realm.

## Henry VII and the Welsh connection
Henry VII’s accession in 1485 was a turning point for Wales. Landing in Pembroke and gathering support from Welsh nobles, Henry’s victory at Bosworth had a clear Welsh dimension: many Welsh gentry who had stood with him expected rewards. Henry consolidated power by bringing the Marcher lordships more firmly under royal influence and by re-establishing central institutions that could bind Wales to the Crown. The Council in the Marches, based at Ludlow from 1493, became a key instrument for royal control, providing a forum to manage legal and administrative matters across the border regions. Henry also cultivated the loyalty of influential Welsh families — for example the reward and use of local magnates such as Sir Rhys ap Thomas — and used royal offices and charters to limit the independence of Marcher lords. These moves did not abolish Welsh identity, but they began a process of political integration in which Wales was increasingly managed as a sphere of English royal authority.

## Governance under Henry VII and local elites
Henry VII’s policy towards Wales combined central oversight with the co-option of local elites. The re-established Council in the Marches handled justice, maintained order and represented the Crown’s interests; Ludlow served as the administrative centre where Welsh affairs could be supervised without direct day-to-day intervention from London. Henry’s strategy relied on selective patronage: placing Welsh gentry in positions at court and in local government tied their interests to the Tudor dynasty. The investiture of English princes as Princes of Wales, such as Arthur in 1489 and later Henry (the future Henry VIII) in 1504, signalled the symbolic incorporation of Wales into the royal family. This period saw the gradual reduction of the Marcher lords’ legal autonomy while preserving local structures, an approach that favoured stability and prevented immediate, violent resistance.

## Henry VIII’s early approach to Wales, 1509–1531
When Henry VIII succeeded in 1509 he inherited an arrangement in Wales that still relied heavily on local power-brokers and the Council in the Marches. Early in his reign central ministers and churchmen were employed to strengthen royal control. Figures such as John Veysey, who served as Lord President of the Council in the Marches, represented an attempt to place trusted officials in positions of Welsh administration. The south of Wales continued to see powerful families, including both traditional Marcher houses and rising gentry, whose quarrels and rivalries sometimes required royal intervention. The presence of Princess Mary at Ludlow (1525–1531) highlights how royal attention could be focused on Wales as a training ground for princely government. At the same time, disputes such as that involving Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd, where grievances over inheritance and royal interference were severe enough to prompt charges of treason, show the tensions produced by Henry’s centralising instincts. These early decades were therefore a period of negotiation: the Crown sought firmer control while still depending on local networks to enforce order.

## The Reformation and its impact in Wales
Religious change under Henry VIII — the Henrician Reformation — had profound effects in Wales as elsewhere, yet the impact there had distinctive cultural and social features. The initial break with Rome owed as much to dynastic and political considerations as to theology, but its consequences for Welsh religious life were serious. The dissolution of the monasteries (driven by Thomas Cromwell and central government policy) removed important centres of local charity, learning and local identity. Prominent Welsh religious houses such as Tintern, Neath, Margam and Strata Florida were suppressed; their lands were often sold to new or existing local elites, changing patterns of landholding and patronage. Many Welsh people retained conservative attachments to traditional religious practice, and the imposition of new religious forms met with local resistance in places.

At the same time, cultural developments helped to shape a long-term Welsh response to religious change. The Welsh language remained central to popular identity and worship. The translation and printing of religious texts into Welsh — including the first substantial Welsh book printed in the mid-1540s, often referred to as Yn y Llyfr Hwn (1547 in some accounts) — had an important role in embedding Protestant scripture and liturgy in the vernacular. That effort would, paradoxically, strengthen the position of the Welsh language even as it placed Welsh religious life within the new national church framework.

## The Acts of Union, 1536 and 1543: what changed and why
The Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543 (sometimes discussed together as the Tudor "Union" with Wales) represented the most significant legal and administrative reorganisation of Wales since the medieval period. They had several interlocking aims: to end the lawlessness associated with Marcher lordships, to regularise administration and justice across Wales and the border, to secure royal authority during a period of religious and political uncertainty, and to make governance more efficient. The Acts abolished the autonomous Marcher lordships, created counties and county courts, and extended English legal institutions such as sheriffs and Justices of the Peace into Wales. The court system of Quarter Sessions and the Great Sessions was standardised, bringing Welsh governance closer to the English model. Administratively, Wales gained more systematic representation in the Tudor state.

Thomas Cromwell played a key role in shaping the Acts, pushing the Crown’s agenda for centralised, uniform government. The background included concerns about lawlessness in Wales (Rowland Lee, an energetic enforcer, had prosecuted many cases) and fears that religious change could provoke unrest or even foreign-supported rebellions. The language clauses in the Acts were controversial: English became the language of administration and the courts unless an individual could demonstrate knowledge of Welsh. In practice this placed pressure on the Welsh language among elites and in legal contexts, although it did not erase the vernacular or popular culture. Historians often note that the Acts were as much an assimilationist policy as a unification; they integrated Wales into the English legal and political system but did not create cultural homogeneity.

## Significance, impact and interpretations
Assessing the significance of the Acts requires balancing their practical effects against their cultural consequences. Administratively, they ended the haphazard jurisdiction of Marcher lords and provided a clearer structure of government, law and taxation. That had real benefits in terms of reducing local feuds, improving the Crown’s reach, and enabling more consistent justice. Legal uniformity and the presence of royal officials made Wales easier to govern and drew Welsh elites into the Tudor system. Economically and politically the Acts helped to stabilise the region and to integrate Welsh society into broader Tudor institutions.

On the cultural side, the Acts have a double-edged reputation. The language clauses and imposition of English legal forms are often viewed as instruments of anglicisation, limiting Welsh participation in public office for monolingual Welsh speakers and weakening traditional Welsh legal practices. Yet the period also saw efforts to preserve and cultivate Welsh culture through the use of the vernacular in religion and education; the translation of religious texts into Welsh ensured that the language remained vital in worship and daily life. Historians debate whether the Acts were primarily coercive assimilation or necessary modernisation. Contemporary Welsh responses ranged from accommodation by many gentry to resentment among those who felt their traditional rights and customs had been eroded. In the longer term, the Acts set the constitutional framework that linked Wales to England while leaving a distinct Welsh cultural identity that would revivify in later centuries.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Wales and the early Tudors you should combine clear factual recall with focused analysis. Begin by placing your answer in time: mention dates (e.g. Acts of Union 1536 and 1543) and key figures (Henry VII, Henry VIII, Thomas Cromwell, Rowland Lee). For AO1 (knowledge) include specific examples such as the abolition of Marcher lordships, the creation of counties, the role of the Council in the Marches at Ludlow, and the dissolution of monasteries such as Tintern. For AO2 (interpretation of concepts) explain continuity and change: show what was altered by the Acts and what Welsh society retained (the endurance of the Welsh language, regional identities). For AO3 (source and interpretation evaluation) practise weighing evidence: if given a source claim that the Acts were oppressive, test it against administrative improvements and later Welsh cultural resilience; consider authorship, date and purpose of sources when assessing reliability. Structure paragraphs with a concise claim, an explanation, an example and a brief evaluative comment before moving to the next point. Remember to reach a balanced judgement in your conclusion that answers the question directly, supported by the strongest evidence. Time-manage the paper so that you leave a few minutes to write a clear concluding paragraph summarising your judgement about the degree of unity or assimilation achieved by the Acts and their lasting legacy in Welsh history.
