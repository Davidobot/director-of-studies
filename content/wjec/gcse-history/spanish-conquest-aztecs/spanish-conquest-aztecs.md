# The Spanish conquest of the Aztecs (GCSE History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview and background
The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire took place in the early sixteenth century, a short but transformative episode in world history. It began with European expansion from the Iberian Peninsula after 1492, when Spain and Portugal drove Atlantic exploration. Spanish interest in the Americas quickly shifted from coastal islands to the mainland as reports of vast civilizations and riches reached the crown. By the 1510s and 1520s Spanish explorers were moving into Central America. Hernán Cortés led an expedition that reached the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan in 1519, and after two years of warfare, diplomacy and disease the city fell in 1521. Understanding this conquest involves both what each side brought to the encounter — political organisation, military technology, belief systems and disease environments — and how these combined to produce a rapid collapse of Aztec power and the creation of Spanish colonial rule in New Spain.

## Spanish motivations and the early expansion
Spain’s motives for expansion combined political, economic and religious aims. The newly unified crowns of Castile and Aragon were interested in expanding royal authority and finding sources of wealth to fund rivalries in Europe. The promise of gold and other riches, reported by earlier voyages in the Caribbean, attracted soldiers of fortune and investors. Religious motives were also important: Spanish rulers and missionaries saw the conversion of Indigenous peoples to Christianity as both a duty and a justification for conquest. Technological and navigational developments — improved ships, navigation techniques and maps — made long-distance expeditions feasible. The Spanish also operated under legal and ideological assumptions that Europeans had rights to lands they claimed by discovery and conversion, reinforced by papal and royal decrees that shaped how conquest and colonisation would be justified.

## Aztec civilisation and the political landscape
At the arrival of the Spaniards the Aztec Empire centred on Tenochtitlan, a large urban capital built on a lake with causeways, marketplaces and a sacred precinct. Aztec rule was based on a system of tribute and military dominance over a network of subject city-states. The emperor (tlatoani) and the nobility controlled religion, land allocation and military affairs. Aztec society was sophisticated in administration, agriculture, craft production and ritual. However, the empire was not a unified nation-state in the modern sense; it depended on a fragile system of alliances and the submission of rival polities. Many of the people under Aztec rule resented heavy tribute demands and the practice of taking captives for ritual sacrifice. These tensions were crucial when the Spanish arrived, because Cortés and his men were able to exploit local grievances to form alliances that dramatically shifted the balance of power.

## Hernán Cortés and the campaign of 1519–1521
Hernán Cortés was an ambitious Spanish conquistador who sailed from Cuba to the mainland in 1519. He disobeyed orders from the governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez, and set out with a relatively small force of Spaniards. Cortés quickly used a combination of diplomacy, deception and force to advance inland. He encountered Montezuma II, the Aztec emperor, and the sources record a complex series of meetings in which Cortés was initially welcomed. Cortés forged an early and decisive alliance with the Tlaxcalans and other Indigenous groups hostile to the Aztecs; these allies provided the majority of troops during the campaigns that followed. Key events include Cortés’s march to Tenochtitlan, the taking of Montezuma as a hostage, the brief expulsion of the Spaniards after the uprising known as La Noche Triste in 1520, and the final siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521. The Spaniards’ use of cavalry, firearms, steel weaponry and ships on the lake were military advantages, but equally decisive were their Indigenous allies and the impact of new diseases.

## Why the Aztecs were defeated
The fall of the Aztec Empire cannot be explained by a single cause. Instead, multiple factors combined to favour the Spanish. First, political fragmentation and resentments among subject peoples meant that the Spaniards could recruit tens of thousands of Indigenous allies, who bore the brunt of the fighting. Second, military technology gave the Europeans tactical advantages: horses, steel weapons, armour and guns changed the nature of engagements and intimidated many Indigenous warriors. Third, diplomacy and psychological warfare mattered; Spanish tactics included taking hostages, making displays of power and exploiting misunderstandings about European intentions. Fourth, disease, especially smallpox, devastated Indigenous populations who had no immunity to Old World pathogens. Smallpox outbreaks in 1520–1521 weakened Aztec military capacity and morale, killing large numbers of warriors and civilians and leaving social structures in disarray. Lastly, leadership shocks — the capture and death of Montezuma II, and the disruption of Aztec command — further undermined coordinated resistance. Together, these elements produced a rapid collapse of the Aztec state.

## Immediate and long-term effects
The immediate effects of the conquest were catastrophic for Indigenous populations. The siege of Tenochtitlan led to widespread death and destruction within the city, and the spread of European diseases led to demographic collapse across Mesoamerica. Politically, the conquest replaced the Aztec imperial structure with Spanish colonial institutions. The Spanish crown established the Viceroyalty of New Spain and implemented systems such as the encomienda, which granted Spanish settlers rights to Indigenous labour and tribute in return for supposed protection and Christian instruction. Culturally, the imposition of Christianity, the suppression of certain native practices and the introduction of Spanish language and laws reshaped daily life. Economically, the conquest opened access to vast mineral wealth, particularly silver, which transformed global trade networks and fed inflation and economic changes in Europe. The Columbian Exchange — the movement of plants, animals and diseases between Old and New Worlds — permanently altered diets, economies and ecologies on both sides of the Atlantic.

## Interpretations and historical debates
Historians debate how to understand the conquest: was it a Spanish military triumph driven by superior arms and cunning, or was it a broader collapse of Indigenous societies brought on by disease and internal divisions? Some interpretations emphasise Cortés’s agency and the role of Spanish strategy, leadership and violence. Others draw attention to Indigenous agency, stressing that many Indigenous groups chose to ally with the Spaniards for their own political ends, and that internal dynamics of the Aztec Empire made it vulnerable. Recent scholarship also examines the cultural encounters and the ways Indigenous people adapted, resisted and negotiated under colonial rule. When studying interpretations, it is important to consider the sources: Spanish chronicles, Indigenous codices and archaeological evidence each offer different perspectives and biases. Evaluating the provenance and motive behind a source helps build a balanced understanding of the conquest.

## Teaching and classroom approaches
Teaching this topic benefits from a range of materials and activities that help students understand cause, consequence and significance. Contemporary Spanish accounts, such as letters and chronicles, can be paired with Indigenous pictorial records and archaeology to highlight contrasting viewpoints. Mapping exercises that follow Cortés’s route, the locations of allied Indigenous groups and the layout of Tenochtitlan help make the geography clear. Timelines focusing on 1519–1521, with side panels on disease outbreaks and the activities of other European powers, show how rapid and interconnected events were. Case studies of particular allies, such as the Tlaxcalans, or individuals like La Malinche (Malinalli), are useful to explore Indigenous agency and the complexities of collaboration. Where possible, encourage students to consider long-term consequences by tracing links from the conquest to colonial systems like the encomienda and to the global silver trade.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, begin by identifying exactly what the question asks and which assessment objective it targets. For knowledge questions (AO1), organise a clear narrative with key dates, names and events, making sure to explain significance rather than just listing facts. For questions about causes, change or consequences (AO2), link causes explicitly to outcomes: explain how political divisions, military technology, alliances and disease combined to produce Aztec collapse, and ensure each paragraph makes a separate, developed point. For source-based questions (AO3), always comment on both content and provenance: who created the source, when and why, and how that affects its reliability and usefulness. Compare sources where asked, using differences in perspective to support a judgement. For the historical enquiry task (AO4) practise structuring answers in clear stages: form a focused question, review the evidence, plan a structured response, and conclude with a balanced judgement that assesses strengths and limitations of the evidence.

In practice, a strong paragraph follows a clear structure: make a point, support it with specific evidence (names, dates, events), explain how the evidence supports the point, and link back to the question. Use precise examples such as Cortés’s alliance with the Tlaxcalans, La Noche Triste, the smallpox epidemics of 1520–1521 and the Siege of Tenochtitlan to illustrate arguments. When evaluating interpretations, weigh different explanations and explain why one interpretation may be more convincing, considering source bias and available evidence. Manage time by allocating minutes in proportion to the marks available: longer essays and source evaluations need planning time to ensure a coherent argument. Finally, in conclusions avoid sweeping generalisations; instead, summarise the strongest evidence and acknowledge uncertainty where sources are limited.
