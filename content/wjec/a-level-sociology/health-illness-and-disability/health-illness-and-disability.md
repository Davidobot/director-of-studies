# Health, illness and disability (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

Health, illness and disability is a core A‑level topic that sits within the unit on Power and Control. It invites you to move beyond individual or biomedical explanations and to understand health as both a personal experience and a social phenomenon shaped by institutions, inequalities and cultural meanings. This chapter brings together key concepts and debates you will need to know: the social construction of health and illness, different ways of defining and measuring health and disability, the major sociological explanations for patterns and trends, the role of medical professionals and the process of medicalisation, and the policy context in the UK and Wales. Throughout, the emphasis is on applying theory to evidence and on evaluating explanations in order to draw balanced conclusions.

Understanding what we mean by health, illness and disability begins with definitions. The biomedical model treats health as the absence of disease and locates illness in biological malfunction. Sociology contrasts this with social and interactionist approaches that emphasise the meanings people attach to being well or unwell and the social consequences of those meanings. Disability can be understood through two complementary frameworks. The medical model locates disability in the individual’s impairment, while the social model sees disability as the result of physical, attitudinal and institutional barriers erected by society. The Equality Act 2010 provides a legal definition of disability in the UK that has practical consequences, but sociological analysis asks us to consider how social structures, norms and policies produce disabling circumstances in the first place.

Patterns and trends in health and illness are a central part of the specification. Sociologists look at differences by social class, gender, ethnicity and age, and they consider both mortality (death rates, life expectancy) and morbidity (rates of long‑term conditions, self‑reported poor health, disability prevalence). In the UK context—and Wales in particular—there have long been persistent inequalities: more deprived communities experience higher rates of many illnesses, lower life expectancy and greater numbers of years lived with disability. These patterns prompt questions about explanation. Are differences real biological phenomena, artefacts of measurement, or the result of social determinants such as poverty, housing, education, work and access to services? In answering such questions you should be able to explain concepts such as artefact (apparent differences caused by the way data are collected), self‑selection, material deprivation, and cultural explanations (differences in health‑related knowledge, beliefs and practices). Using contemporary examples—such as regional gaps in life expectancy, higher prevalence of chronic conditions in disadvantaged areas, or differential impacts of public health crises—helps to make analytical points concrete and shows examiners you can apply sociological ideas to real data.

Different theoretical perspectives offer competing explanations for health inequalities and the organisation of healthcare. Functionalists emphasise the role of the medical profession and health systems in maintaining social order: the sick role, as formulated by Parsons, assigns rights and obligations to the sick person and to medical professionals who restore them to health. Marxists and neo‑Marxists focus on the structural causes of ill health in capitalist societies: class inequalities, exploitation, the commodification of healthcare, and market incentives that can distort priorities. From this viewpoint, poverty, workplace hazards and the profit motives of pharmaceutical corporations help to explain unequal health outcomes. Interactionists direct attention to the lived experience of illness and the process of labelling; they examine how people negotiate identities when they become sick and how stigma can shape access to support. Feminist perspectives highlight gendered patterns in health and healthcare, drawing attention to androcentric medical research, diagnostic biases, and how social roles and responsibilities influence men’s and women’s health differently. Postmodernist and contemporary critical theorists problematise fixed categories of sickness and health, emphasising the plural, consumerised nature of healthcare in a late modern risk society where ‘self‑care’ and medical consumerism reshape experiences of health.

A particularly important debate is medicalisation: the extension of medical authority into areas of life previously seen as normal or private. Examples are plentiful—childbirth practices, the growth in diagnosed mental health conditions, the medical framing of menopause, or debates about obesity and lifestyle. Medicalisation brings benefits, such as access to care and research, but it also raises concerns about over‑diagnosis, pharmaceuticalisation and the expansion of professional control. Linked to this is the role of health professionals themselves. The concept of professional dominance describes how medicine has developed autonomy, expertise and authority; yet recent decades have seen challenges to professional power from patient advocacy, managerialism, consumer expectations and policy reforms. In Wales, devolution means that health policy is shaped by the Welsh Government and by NHS Wales, so comparisons with England can reveal how different policy choices influence provision and outcomes.

Inequalities in health are best understood through the concept of social determinants: those wider social, economic and environmental conditions that influence health. Material inequalities—such as poor housing, insecure work, low income and limited access to nutritious food—are powerful predictors of ill health. Cultural factors such as health literacy, norms around smoking, drinking and diet, and patterns of social support also matter. Intersectionality is a useful lens here: class, gender, ethnicity, disability and age intersect to produce distinct health risks and experiences. For example, women from ethnic minority groups may face both cultural and institutional barriers to care, while older people in deprived areas may experience multiple overlapping disadvantages. The social model of disability reframes responses: instead of focusing solely on medical interventions, policy can aim to remove structural barriers—improving transport, accessibility, employment rights and anti‑discrimination enforcement. These policy implications are directly relevant to the A‑level emphasis on the relationship between sociological issues and contemporary social policy.

Empirical evidence and research methods are central to convincing sociological argument in this topic. Health sociology draws on a wide range of methods. Quantitative sources include official statistics (mortality averages, disease prevalence, life expectancy), longitudinal studies that track cohorts over time, and large‑scale surveys that allow for statistical analysis of socio‑demographic patterns. Qualitative methods—ethnography, in‑depth interviews and focus groups—are vital for understanding experiences of illness, interactions with health professionals, and the social meaning of disability. Each method has strengths and limitations. Official statistics provide broad coverage and comparability but can conceal under‑reporting and fail to capture lived experience; surveys offer generalisable findings but may lack detail; qualitative research illuminates processes and meanings but raises questions about representativeness. Ethical considerations are particularly important in health research: confidentiality, informed consent, the vulnerability of participants, and the potential for harm must be managed carefully. In exam answers you should be able to link evidence from different methods to the theoretical debate you are discussing and to evaluate how well particular methods support or undermine specific conclusions.

When discussing health and disability with a Wales focus you can refer to differences in policy since devolution, the organisation of NHS Wales, and local examples of provision or reform. For instance, public health initiatives, differences in waiting times, or regional programmes addressing health inequalities can all be used to demonstrate applied knowledge. International and global dimensions can also be relevant: discussions of global health inequalities, the impact of transnational pharmaceutical companies, or world development debates about health systems provide comparative perspective and can strengthen evaluation by showing alternative models and outcomes.

A strong answer integrates theory, evidence and policy, and evaluates alternative explanations. It is not enough to describe patterns or list theories; you must explain how each perspective accounts for the evidence, point out limitations and contradictions, and consider the implications for social policy. For example, if you argue that material deprivation explains differences in life expectancy, acknowledge counter‑arguments (cultural explanations, the role of individual behaviour, and measurement issues) and discuss what kinds of policies would follow from a materialist approach compared with those implied by a biomedical or cultural explanation.

## Exam technique

In the exam, start by defining key terms—health, illness, disability, medicalisation, social determinants—so the marker knows exactly how you are using them. Use relevant theory as an organising framework in longer answers: introduce a theory, apply it to empirical evidence (including Welsh or UK examples where appropriate), and then evaluate the theory’s explanatory power and limitations. Evaluation can draw on other theories, methodological critiques, contemporary changes (for example, policy shifts since devolution) and practical implications. For method‑based questions, be explicit about the strengths and weaknesses of particular research designs, the reliability and validity of data, and ethical issues, and link these points to how persuasive the evidence is for different explanations of health patterns. In essays aim for a clear structure with an introduction that outlines your argument, paragraphs that develop points in depth and a conclusion that summarises and judges the balance of evidence. For shorter questions focus on precision: give a clear definition, a succinct application or example, and one or two evaluative points. Always try to include contemporary examples or data to illustrate points: these make answers more specific and convincing. Finally, practice writing under timed conditions, plan essays briefly before you write, and review the specification’s assessment objectives—AO1, AO2 and AO3—so that your answers demonstrate knowledge, application and critical evaluation in the proportions examiners expect.
