# Social inequality and stratification (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## What this topic covers and how it fits the specification
Social inequality and stratification is one of the central themes of the WJEC/Eduqas A-level Sociology specification and runs through the A2 content most directly, while also being threaded through AS units. The topic asks you to explain how society is divided and ranked, why these differences persist, and how they shape life chances in areas such as education, health, work and political participation. You will be expected to use empirical evidence, statistical data and contemporary examples — including examples from Wales where appropriate — and to show how different sociological perspectives offer competing explanations. At A2 you also apply and evaluate research methods when studying inequality, so the topic connects theory, evidence and method: you must be able to describe patterns, explain them using a range of theories, and criticise both the evidence and the explanations.

## Key concepts: what to know and use
To tackle questions on inequality you need a secure command of core sociological concepts. Stratification refers to the hierarchical arrangement of social groups that produces unequal access to resources, prestige and power. Social class, gender, ethnicity, age and nation are the main axes of differentiation you will encounter, but you should also appreciate the role of status, role, norms and values in producing and justifying inequality. Life chances is a useful concept for linking structural inequalities to individual outcomes: it helps explain why people from particular backgrounds tend to experience different levels of educational attainment, health or income. Remember also the idea of social construction: categories such as disability or crime are not simply given facts but constructed in social and political contexts, which matters when you evaluate official statistics or media representations.

## Patterns and evidence: where inequality shows up
Evidence of inequality can be drawn from many areas of social life. In education you should be able to discuss attainment gaps by social class, gender and ethnicity and consider the influence of material factors, cultural capital, labelling and school processes. In health, you will need to explain social gradients in morbidity and mortality, consider the role of access to services and lifestyle explanations, and refer to policy differences such as those between the NHS in England and health services in Wales. Labour market inequalities include occupational segregation, pay gaps and precarious work, and world sociology highlights global inequalities in wealth, development and access to resources shaped by history, trade and globalisation. When using statistics, be precise about what the data measure: for example, crime rates may reflect recording practices and policing priorities as much as underlying offending. Wherever possible bring contemporary and local examples into answers — for instance, reference changes in family forms such as increasing cohabitation, rising life expectancy, or Welsh Government reports — to demonstrate application of sociological knowledge to real-world contexts.

## Theoretical approaches to explaining inequality
The specification requires you to use a range of theories to explain patterns of stratification, and to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. Functionalist perspectives explain inequality in terms of social order and the roles necessary to maintain a complex society; they emphasise meritocratic principles but are criticised for underplaying conflict and privilege. Marxist and neo-Marxist approaches focus on class divisions and exploitation, seeing inequality as rooted in capitalist ownership and market relations; they are strong at explaining structural power but can understate cultural and gendered differences. Weberian accounts add the idea of status and party, allowing a more multi-dimensional view of stratification. Feminist theories foreground gender as a fundamental axis of inequality and explore how patriarchy intersects with class and ethnicity. Postmodernist approaches question grand narratives and emphasise fluid identities and fragmentation, useful for understanding changing forms of inequality such as the rise of new social movements or consumer identities. New Right perspectives emphasise individual responsibility, market solutions and the role of the family in socialisation, and are often used in policy debates; critical evaluation should note where these perspectives neglect structural disadvantage.

## Research methods and applied methods for studying inequality
A key element at A2 is the application of research methods to questions about inequality. You must be able to design and justify a research project, operationalise concepts, select appropriate methods, and evaluate ethical and practical issues. Understand the difference between quantitative and qualitative approaches: quantitative methods such as surveys and official statistics are useful for measuring patterns and making comparisons, while qualitative methods such as interviews, focus groups and ethnography reveal meanings, processes and lived experience. Sampling decisions matter: representative sampling strategies (simple random, stratified, systematic) give scope for generalisation, whereas non-representative techniques (snowball, purposive) are often used to access hard-to-reach groups but limit generalisability. Triangulation and methodological pluralism are important for strengthening validity. Ethical considerations are central: informed consent, confidentiality, protection from harm and sensitivity to vulnerability must be addressed, particularly when researching marginalised groups. Practical constraints of access, gatekeepers, time and cost should be acknowledged in any research design, together with strategies for presenting data clearly, using tables, charts and thematic analysis where appropriate.

## Applying theory to evidence and evaluating explanations
High-quality answers combine theory and evidence: for example, when explaining class differences in educational attainment, you might use Bourdieu’s ideas about cultural capital to account for why middle-class children gain advantages through language and habits, complement these with material explanations about resources and home environment, and then evaluate using counter-evidence or policy interventions that have narrowed gaps. When discussing health inequalities, you can compare biomedical models that locate illness in biological factors with sociological explanations that emphasise social determinants and the medicalisation of everyday life, assessing the policy implications of each. Effective evaluation will interrogate the evidence base, consider alternative explanations, and point out methodological limitations such as problems of causality, measurement bias in official statistics, or the impact of researcher identity in qualitative studies. Always aim to balance a clear exposition of sociological theory with concrete examples and critical commentary.

## Using the Welsh context and contemporary examples
WJEC/Eduqas specifies that learners should refer to Wales where it is relevant and enriches answers to do so. Use Welsh Government statistics, discuss devolved policy differences, and explore questions of Welsh identity and nationality where they arise. For instance, when answering on education you might contrast policies such as the Welsh Government’s curriculum developments or different accountability systems with those in England, and consider the implications for attainment patterns. In debates about political participation, refer to devolution, Welsh assemblies and regional variations in turnout. Bringing local case studies and recent policy changes into your responses demonstrates application (AO2) and can provide fruitful material for evaluation (AO3) because you can assess whether policies have reduced or reinforced inequalities.

## How assessment works and what examiners look for
Examiners assess three main objectives: knowledge and understanding of sociological theories and methods (AO1), the ability to apply that knowledge to issues and evidence (AO2), and the capacity to analyse and evaluate arguments, evidence and methods (AO3). Across the full A-level the weighting gives strong importance to AO1 and AO2, but AO3 becomes increasingly significant at A2. In practice this means your answers must do more than list theories: you must explain them, use them to make sense of real-world patterns or data, and then offer critical judgements about their usefulness. For applied methods questions, you are expected to design research that is realistic and justified, explaining choices about operationalisation, sampling, ethics and potential problems. For essays on inequality, integrate empirical evidence from a range of areas (education, health, work, crime) and show how different theories can be used together or contrasted to build a balanced argument.

## Exam technique
Plan your answers before you start writing: identify the question’s focus, decide which theories and evidence you will use, and outline a clear argument. For essays, spend a short time drafting a structure: an introduction that defines key concepts and states your argument, a series of paragraphs that develop points with theory and contemporary examples, and a conclusion that weighs up the evidence and reaches an informed judgement. In shorter applied methods questions, be precise about operationalisation, sampling and ethics, and always justify why a method is appropriate for the research aim. Use the command words in the question to guide depth: "describe" requires clear factual knowledge, "explain" requires causal linkage and theoretical application, and "evaluate" requires analysis of strengths and limitations. Where data or stimulus materials are provided, refer explicitly to them and interpret their implications for theory and policy. Time management is vital: allocate time in proportion to the marks available, leaving time to proofread and ensure your final paragraph answers the question directly. Above all, practise writing concise, evidence-led paragraphs that link theory to concrete examples, and use past papers to get comfortable with the balance between AO1, AO2 and AO3 that examiners expect.
