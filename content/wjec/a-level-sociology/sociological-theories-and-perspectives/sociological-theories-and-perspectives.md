# Sociological theories and perspectives (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: why perspectives matter
Sociological theories are ways of seeing the social world. They offer different lenses for explaining how societies are organised, why inequalities persist, how identities are formed and how social change happens. For A‑level Sociology you will be expected not only to remember the key ideas of each perspective, but to apply them to topics such as education, family, crime, media and health, to recognise their strengths and limitations, and to use them to interpret contemporary evidence—including examples from Wales where relevant. Keep in mind that no single theory gives a complete explanation; exam answers score highly when they show comparative understanding, draw on evidence and engage with methodological and policy implications.

## Functionalism: order, integration and the value consensus
Functionalist theory sees society as a system of interdependent parts that work together to maintain stability and social order. Institutions such as the family, education and religion are understood in terms of the functions they perform: socialising new members, transmitting shared values, allocating roles and ensuring cohesion. Emile Durkheim’s focus on social facts and Talcott Parsons’ ideas about the role of socialisation and role allocation are central here. Parsons argued that education, for example, socialises young people into meritocratic values and allocates them to appropriate roles in the labour market. Functionalists explain social problems as temporary dysfunctions or as signs of slow adaptation to social change rather than as systemic problems.

In application, functionalist explanations are useful when discussing how institutions contribute to stability—for instance, how schools provide a common curriculum that supports national identity, or how community organisations in Wales help sustain local traditions and cultural practices. However, functionalism is often criticised for assuming a value consensus that does not account for conflict, inequality or the experience of marginalised groups. A strong exam response will outline the functionalist view, give contemporary examples, and then balance this with critiques that point to unequal power and conflicting interests in society.

## Marxism and neo‑Marxism: class, conflict and ideology
Marxist perspectives place class struggle and the economic organisation of society at the heart of explanation. From Karl Marx, the central idea is that the capitalist system produces and reproduces class inequalities: the bourgeoisie own the means of production and exploit the proletariat. Marxists see institutions such as the media and education as ideological state apparatuses that reproduce ruling-class ideology and consent. Neo‑Marxist theories extend and adapt these ideas; Antonio Gramsci’s concept of cultural hegemony explains how consent is manufactured through civil society, while writers like Althusser emphasise the role of ideology and interpellation in shaping identities.

Marxist explanations are powerful when analysing patterns of inequality in education, work and health. They help to explain why certain social groups consistently achieve worse outcomes and can be used to interpret statistics on income distribution or occupational segregation in Wales and the UK. In the classroom, Marxist critiques are often paired with examples of policy that support capitalist interests, such as market-driven reforms in public services. Criticisms of Marxism include that it can be economically deterministic and underplay the importance of gender, ethnicity and other sources of identity and resistance. A balanced answer will show how neo‑Marxist developments address some of these limits while still recognising their own weaknesses.

## Weberian perspectives and neo‑Weberian contributions: class, status and power
Max Weber offered a more multi-dimensional analysis of social stratification. Rather than reducing society to economic class alone, Weber argued that class (economic position), status (social prestige) and party (political power) are distinct but interrelated sources of inequality. Weber also brought interpretive methods into sociology, stressing verstehen, or the researcher’s attempt to understand actors’ meanings and motivations. Contemporary neo‑Weberian approaches combine structure and agency, recognising how class divisions interact with cultural status and organisational power.

Weberian ideas are especially useful when explaining phenomena that do not fit a pure class analysis, such as the cultural prestige attached to certain professions, the role of bureaucracy in modern institutions, or the complex ways national and regional identities operate in Wales. For example, differing forms of capital—economic, cultural and social—affect educational attainment and life chances in nuanced ways that Weberian analysis captures. Exams typically reward candidates who can contrast Weber with Marx, showing how the former offers a richer vocabulary for discussing social closure, party politics and the role of ideas in shaping action.

## Feminist perspectives: gender, patriarchy and intersectionality
Feminist theories examine how gender structures social life and produces inequalities. Early liberal feminism focused on legal and educational reforms to remove gender barriers, Marxist feminism connected women’s oppression to capitalist production and domestic labour, and radical feminism highlighted patriarchal power and male domination. More recent feminist work introduces intersectionality, the idea that gender cannot be analysed in isolation from other identities such as class, ethnicity, disability and nationality. Intersectional feminism emphasises that women’s experiences are shaped by overlapping systems of oppression.

Feminist perspectives are central to topics such as family roles, workplace inequality, media representations and health. They explain patterns such as the gender pay gap, occupational segregation and differential access to healthcare, and they inform policy debates about childcare, parental leave and anti‑discrimination measures. In exam answers, demonstrating the ability to apply different strands of feminist thought to specific evidence—such as gendered patterns in education or media portrayal of women in Wales—will score well. Evaluation should include consideration of the diversity of feminist approaches and critiques that some strands can overgeneralise or neglect men’s experiences and broader economic forces.

## Interactionism and social constructionism: meanings and labelling
Interactionist perspectives, often associated with symbolic interactionism, focus on micro-level social processes and the ways people construct meaning in everyday interactions. Labelling theory, a key interactionist approach, explains deviance as the outcome of social reactions: when an act is labelled deviant by powerful agencies (police, media), the labelled person may internalise that identity and follow a deviant career. Interactionists emphasise qualitative methods and the subjective meanings people attach to situations.

These approaches are valuable when analysing topics where identity and interpretation matter, such as youth cultures, media consumption and patterns of labelling in crime statistics. For instance, interactionism helps explain moral panics and the disproportionate criminalisation of minority groups, and it encourages close attention to how institutions categorise people. Critics of interactionism point out that micro-level focus can ignore structural inequalities; strong exam responses show awareness of both levels and consider how labelling interacts with class and institutional power.

## Postmodernism, the New Right and pluralist perspectives: fragmentation, marketisation and power debates
Contemporary perspectives add further complexity. Postmodernist theories argue that grand narratives (universal explanations) are no longer adequate in a globalised, media-saturated world. Postmodernists emphasise fragmentation of identity, the role of consumer culture, and the breakdown of traditional institutions. These ideas are often used to explain changes in youth culture, the diversification of family forms, and the fluidity of identity in late modern society.

The New Right presents a very different view. Emphasising individual responsibility, market principles and traditional values, New Right approaches have strongly influenced policy debates about education, welfare and crime. Marketisation of schools, choice and competition, and policies aimed at reducing state dependency reflect New Right assumptions. Pluralist and elite theories debate the distribution of power: pluralists argue power is dispersed among competing interest groups, while elite theorists claim a small group controls key decisions. These debates are especially relevant when analysing media ownership, political participation and the influence of pressure groups on policy in devolved contexts such as Wales.

Exam responses that engage with postmodernist critiques, the policy implications of New Right thinking and the contested nature of power will show sophisticated understanding. Good answers will also address criticisms: postmodernism can be accused of relativism and a lack of clear prescriptions, while New Right policies are challenged for ignoring structural inequalities.

## Theory and methods: how perspectives shape research
The relationship between sociological theory and research methods is vital to understanding and evaluating evidence. Positivist tendencies in some structural theories favour quantitative methods that aim to discover general patterns and test hypotheses, producing reliable, generalisable data. Interpretivist approaches, which align with interactionism and much feminist research, prioritise qualitative methods to achieve depth, validity and an understanding of meanings. Marxist and feminist researchers may adopt mixed methods and be reflexive about their own values, while realist approaches seek to bridge structure and agency by combining causal explanation with attention to context.

In practice, choice of method has consequences for concepts such as validity, reliability, representativeness and ethical issues. For example, studying educational inequalities may involve large‑scale surveys to map attainment gaps, ethnography to understand classroom interactions and interviews to capture lived experience. A strong exam response will link theory to method explicitly: explain why a particular theoretical perspective would favour certain methods, evaluate the strengths and limitations of those methods for investigating the topic, and reflect on ethical and practical constraints when gathering data in Wales or elsewhere.

## Exam technique
To score highly in WJEC/Eduqas Sociology papers you must meet the assessment objectives: demonstrate knowledge (AO1), apply that knowledge to issues or evidence (AO2) and analyse and evaluate (AO3). Start by defining key concepts and stating the perspective you’ll use. When applying theory to a topic, use contemporary and, where possible, Welsh examples to show understanding in context. For analysis, explain how the theory accounts for the evidence and identify underlying assumptions. For evaluation, compare alternative perspectives, point to empirical counter‑evidence, discuss methodological limitations and consider policy implications. Structure essays so each paragraph contains a clear point, explanation, an applied example, and an evaluative comment; save a concise judgement for the conclusion that weighs strengths and weaknesses.

For shorter data‑response or methods questions, read the question carefully to identify command words such as “explain”, “assess” or “evaluate” and tailor your response to the required depth. When answering methods questions, explicitly link methodological strengths and limitations to concepts like validity, reliability and ethics; when designing research, justify choices of method, sampling and procedures and anticipate practical problems and ethical safeguards. Time management is crucial: allocate time in proportion to the marks, leave a few minutes to check your answers, and where relevant, label paragraphs so examiners can easily spot definitions, application, analysis and evaluation. Consistent use of sociological terminology, comparative perspective and well‑chosen examples will lift your answers from descriptive to analytical and maximise marks.
