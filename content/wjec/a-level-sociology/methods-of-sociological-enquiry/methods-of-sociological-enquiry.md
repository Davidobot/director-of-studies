# Methods of sociological enquiry (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview and key concepts
Methods of sociological enquiry are the tools and approaches sociologists use to investigate social life. At A-level you must be confident with key concepts that allow you to assess any method: validity, reliability, representativeness, generalisability, objectivity and ethics. Validity refers to how well a method captures what it claims to measure – for example, whether a classroom observation truly reflects pupils’ experiences. Reliability is about consistency: could the same study repeated in similar circumstances produce similar results? Representativeness means how well a sample mirrors the wider population; generalisability refers to whether findings from a particular study can be applied beyond the research setting. Objectivity is the attempt to minimise researcher bias. These concepts are not just definitions to learn: they should be used to compare methods, to justify research choices, and to evaluate research findings. Throughout the specification you are expected to apply these ideas to empirical contexts, including Welsh examples where appropriate, and to relate methods to wider theoretical approaches such as positivism, interpretivism and realism.

## Primary research methods: questionnaires, interviews, focus groups and observation
Primary methods are those where the sociologist collects new data. Questionnaires are efficient for gathering quantitative data from large samples and are useful when the researcher wants to test hypotheses or produce statistics that can be compared across groups. Closed questions increase reliability and make analysis straightforward, but they can reduce validity if they force respondents into limited categories. Interviews range from highly structured schedules to unstructured conversations. Structured interviews resemble questionnaires and suit positivist aims; semi-structured interviews balance comparable data with the freedom to follow up interesting responses; unstructured interviews are favoured by interpretivists who want to explore meanings and lived experience in depth. Focus groups bring people together to discuss topics and are especially valuable for studying group processes or shared meanings, for example investigating youth culture or local responses to policy changes in a Welsh community. Observation can be participant or non-participant, overt or covert. Participant observation—immersing oneself in a setting—yields rich, contextualised data and high validity, but it can be time-consuming and raise ethical challenges. Non-participant observation is less intrusive but may limit insight into participants’ motives. Use concrete examples in answers: a questionnaire distributed to 500 pupils can give patterns of attainment by social class; an ethnographic study of a local sports club can reveal how identity is produced in everyday interactions.

## Secondary methods, official statistics and documents
Secondary methods use existing data produced by others. Official statistics, such as Welsh Government datasets, school league tables, or national surveys like the Crime Survey for England and Wales, are valuable for studying trends and patterns across large populations. They are cost-effective and often seen as reliable, but they may reflect the categories and priorities of those who collected them rather than the researcher’s questions. Content analysis of documents, newspapers, advertisements or policy papers can reveal social representations and ideological frames. Personal documents such as diaries or letters, when available, provide insight into subjective experience. Historical documents allow longitudinal comparisons. When using secondary data, evaluative points should include issues of definition (what counts as a case), the purposes for which the data were collected, and possible biases in recording or sampling. In applied tasks you should show you can use official statistics and documents to triangulate with primary research and to situate findings in broader social trends.

## Sampling and access
Sampling determines who or what you study and is crucial for representativeness and generalisability. Representative sampling techniques such as simple random, stratified random and systematic sampling rely on a clear sampling frame and are favoured when quantitative generalisation is a priority. Quota sampling is non-random but can ensure key characteristics are included. Non-representative approaches have important roles too: purposive sampling targets specific individuals because they possess particular characteristics relevant to the research question; snowball sampling is useful for accessing hidden or hard-to-reach groups such as recent migrants or drug users; volunteer and opportunity samples are pragmatic and common in classroom research. Access often depends on gatekeepers (school principals, community leaders), and gaining entry may require negotiation, approval and trust-building. Practical issues of access influence method choice: you may choose an online questionnaire if face-to-face access is impossible, or an interview if a community refuses overt observation. In exam answers make your sampling decisions explicit and justify them with reference to the research aim, ethical constraints and the likely impact on validity and generalisability.

## Ethical and practical considerations
Ethical issues are central to sociological research. Informed consent, confidentiality, anonymity, the right to withdraw, the protection of vulnerable participants and the avoidance of harm are core principles. Some topics are sensitive and require extra care, for example research on health, sexuality or trauma. Deception and covert research can be ethically contentious and must be weighed against potential benefits. Practical issues include operationalisation—turning sociological concepts into measurable indicators, such as defining social class by occupation, income or educational level—time constraints, cost, gaining permission, researcher safety and the influence of the researcher on participants (the Hawthorne effect). You should be prepared to explain how ethical problems can be managed in practice: using information sheets and consent forms, anonymising data, debriefing participants and seeking institutional ethical approval. When evaluating methods, discuss likely problems and realistic strategies to reduce harm or bias without overstating feasibility.

## Theoretical approaches and the relationship between theory and methods
Different theoretical positions favour different methods because they have different assumptions about society. Positivists see social reality as external and measurable and favour quantitative, structured methods such as surveys and experiments because these produce objective, reliable data suitable for testing hypotheses. Interpretivists emphasise meaning and social action and therefore prefer qualitative methods such as unstructured interviews and participant observation that yield deep, valid insights into subjective experience. Realists attempt to combine the strengths of both approaches by studying underlying social structures alongside individuals’ meanings, and this stance often legitimises mixed methods. The theory-methods debate is important in exam answers: you should show how methodological choices reflect epistemological assumptions and explain trade-offs. For example, a positivist survey of educational attainment can identify statistical patterns and test hypotheses about class and gender, while an ethnography of a school can explain how teacher–pupil interactions create those patterns. Demonstrating awareness of methodological pluralism and triangulation—using more than one method to strengthen confidence in findings—is essential, especially in applied research design tasks.

## Research design and applied methods
Applied methods questions require you to design, justify and evaluate a research proposal. A strong design begins with a clear research aim and operationalised concepts, followed by a method choice that fits the question. Justify why a survey, interview, observation or mixed-methods approach best answers the question, and explain sampling decisions with specific numbers and procedures when appropriate. Describe how you would collect and record data, pilot instruments to improve reliability, and outline analytic techniques: quantitative data might be analysed with descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations and simple measures of association, while qualitative data would be coded, thematically analysed and illustrated with verbatim quotes. Anticipate ethical issues and practical problems and explain how you would address them. Evaluation should be precise: discuss likely threats to validity (such as social desirability bias in interviews), problems with access or representativeness, and how using methodological pluralism or alternative designs might improve outcomes. In answering applied questions, be specific and realistic: give plausible sample sizes, timescales and examples of operational definitions, and link every methodological choice back to the research objective.

## Data presentation and analysis
Presenting and analysing data requires methods suited to the type of data collected. Quantitative results are commonly presented using tables, bar charts, line graphs and cross-tabulations that reveal patterns across variables; summary statistics such as means, medians and percentages help to convey central tendencies. Qualitative data analysis involves coding, the generation of themes, and methods such as grounded theory or narrative analysis to build explanations from the data. Use of direct quotations can illustrate themes and provide validity, but quotations need to be contextualised and anonymised. Triangulation can be shown by comparing patterns from surveys with themes from interviews or with official statistics. When discussing data presentation in exam answers, explain how particular formats aid interpretation and how choices affect clarity and persuasion. For example, a table showing attainment by social class and gender can make inequalities evident at a glance, while qualitative vignettes can help explain the processes behind those inequalities.

## Exam technique
When answering methods questions, structure your response to meet the assessment objectives. For AO1 start with clear definitions of key terms and a precise description of the method or concept. For AO2 apply the method to the given context or to an appropriate sociological example; where possible use a Welsh or UK example to show awareness of the specification’s context. For AO3 evaluate by weighing strengths and weaknesses, considering ethical and practical limitations, and suggesting realistic improvements or alternative methods. In applied design questions be concrete: state your research aim, operationalise key concepts, choose and justify a method, describe sampling with numbers and technique, outline data collection and analysis procedures, and discuss likely ethical and practical issues with mitigation strategies. Always make explicit links between method choice and research objectives, and use the language of validity, reliability, representativeness and generalisability to justify decisions. Manage time by allocating marks: in a 40-mark design question spend time on justification and evaluation as well as description, and in shorter questions balance definition, application and evaluation. Use examples, signpost your argument with short topic sentences, and finish evaluative answers with a brief conclusion that sums up the most persuasive point. Practise writing concise, evidence-based answers that show you can move from concepts to practical research and back to theory.
