# Crime and deviance (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of the topic
Crime and deviance is an A2 option within the WJEC / Eduqas A-level Sociology specification that explores how societies define, measure and respond to behaviour that breaks formal laws and informal norms. The topic is concerned both with patterns — who commits and who is victimised by crime — and with explanations that come from competing sociological traditions. It asks you to think about the social construction of crime, the methods used to study offending and victimisation, and the relationship between theory, evidence and social policy. Throughout the topic you should be able to refer, where relevant, to England and Wales and consider Welsh-specific data or policies when these add clarity or contrast to national trends.

## Defining and measuring crime
A central starting point is that crime and deviance are socially constructed: what counts as criminal or deviant changes over time, varies between cultures, and is influenced by power relations. Measuring crime is therefore complex. Official statistics, such as police recorded crime, give a long-running record of reported incidents but are affected by reporting practices, policing priorities and changes in law. Victim surveys, including large national household surveys, reveal experiences that never reach the police and therefore help to estimate the “dark figure” of crime. Self-report studies target offending behaviour directly and can uncover patterns of minor or hidden offending but are limited by the honesty and sampling of respondents. Each measure has strengths and weaknesses: official data allow trend analysis and criminal justice comparisons but undercount offences; victim and self-report studies widen understanding but often have sampling and validity issues. A good revision answer explains these trade-offs and links them to specific types of crime — for example, why cybercrime or corporate crime might be particularly hard to capture in official statistics.

## Patterns and the social distribution of crime
Patterns of offending and victimisation show clear social regularities. Age is a strong correlate: young people, and especially young men, account for a disproportionate share of recorded offending, though many young people do not offend. Gender differences persist, with males more likely to be offenders and to commit violent crime; females are more likely to be victims of particular offences such as sexual violence and domestic abuse. Social class and poverty are associated with higher rates of many recorded offences and victimisation, reflecting complex links between material deprivation, opportunity structures and policing. Ethnic disparities in criminal justice outcomes are an important focus: ethnic minority groups can be over-represented in stop-and-search statistics, arrests and custodial sentences, raising questions about discrimination, socio-economic disadvantage and differential offending. Patterns vary across offence types: white-collar and corporate crimes are more likely to be committed by higher-status groups and are often under-detected, while street crime tends to be concentrated in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. When answering exam questions it helps to give concrete, contemporary examples — for instance patterns in knife offences, frauds linked to online platforms, or changes in domestic abuse reporting — and to note differences that might be relevant to Wales.

## Theories and explanations of crime and deviance
Sociology offers a range of theoretical frameworks for explaining crime. Functionalist approaches locate crime in social structures and cultural tensions, arguing that some deviance is inevitable and can perform social functions, such as clarifying norms. Merton’s strain theory explains certain criminal adaptations as a response to a disjunction between culturally approved goals and unequal access to legitimate means. Marxist and neo-Marxist perspectives focus on inequality and power, arguing that laws often protect the interests of the ruling class and criminalise the actions of less powerful groups; they also draw attention to corporate crime and the role of capitalism in producing harm. Interactionist and labelling theories emphasise the role of social reaction: deviance emerges in interaction, and labelling can lead to secondary deviance and career criminality. Right and left realist approaches arose as critiques of earlier perspectives. Right realism treats crime as a practical problem best addressed by tougher law enforcement and situational prevention, while left realism stresses the real harms suffered by victims and supports community-based interventions, structural reform and improved policing that is accountable to disadvantaged communities. Feminist theories highlight gendered patterns of offending and victimisation, the social construction of masculinity, and the ways patriarchal power shapes both crime and the criminal justice response. Postmodernist perspectives question grand narratives, emphasise fragmented identities and point to the diversity of responses to crime in late modern societies. A thorough answer compares these theories, shows their explanatory reach for different kinds of crime, and identifies empirical strengths and weaknesses.

## Interaction between theory and policy: social control and responses
How societies respond to crime reflects both theory and political choice. Policies range from punitive approaches — longer sentences, “zero-tolerance” policing and increased surveillance — to rehabilitative and restorative strategies that focus on reintegration, reparation to victims and addressing root causes. Theories shape these responses: deterrence and incapacitation flow from more punitive rationales, while labelling theory and left realism suggest that heavy-handed responses can worsen problems and that community-based prevention and social investment are better long term. The specification expects you to evaluate how social policies in England and Wales have influenced crime rates and criminal justice practices. For instance, restorative justice initiatives and youth offending teams represent attempts to reduce recidivism through support rather than solely punishment, whereas austerity-era cuts to youth services and legal aid have been argued to increase vulnerability and impede access to justice. Contemporary debates also cover surveillance technologies, the ethics of predictive policing, and the balance between protecting the public and safeguarding civil liberties. Use specific policy examples to illustrate the links between theory and practical outcomes, and consider unintended consequences.

## Crime, the media and moral panics
The media play a powerful role in shaping public perceptions of crime. News values and sensational reporting can exaggerate the prevalence or threat of certain offences, leading to moral panics in which particular groups or behaviours are constructed as societal dangers. Cohen’s classic account of folk devils and moral panics provides a useful tool for explaining how media amplification, political responses and public anxiety interact. Media representation also affects official responses, influencing where police resources are directed and which crimes are prioritized. Contemporary media forms, social media and viral video have changed the pace and scope of moral panics, creating rapid cycles of outrage and policy reaction. In exam answers, it is valuable to link media processes to real cases and to evaluate how media-driven perceptions might diverge from statistical realities, especially for offences that are underreported or highly stigmatised.

## Methods and research issues in studying crime
Studying crime raises particular methodological and ethical challenges. Researchers must decide which data sources to use and how to interpret them, recognising problems such as the dark figure, selection bias in victim and self-report studies, and the influence of law and policing on official statistics. Ethnography and participant observation can yield rich insights into offender subcultures and the lived experience of policing, but they raise safety and ethical dilemmas for researchers. Longitudinal studies are valuable for understanding life-course patterns of offending and desistance, while qualitative interviews can reveal motivations, stigma and the effects of labelling. Theoretical positions influence methodological choices: positivist approaches favour quantification and generalisability, whereas interpretivist approaches prioritise meaning and context. A strong exam answer explains how different methods illuminate different questions, evaluates their limitations, and considers practical and ethical constraints when studying sensitive subjects like violent crime, sexual abuse or terrorism.

## Exam technique
To do well in crime and deviance questions you must demonstrate clear knowledge (AO1), apply that knowledge to the question context (AO2), and evaluate using theory, evidence and alternative explanations (AO3). Begin essays by defining key terms and setting out a brief plan. For shorter questions allocate time to state relevant concepts and back them with an example; for extended essays structure your response with a clear introduction, several developed analytical paragraphs that each include theory, evidence and evaluation, and a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Always unpack what a theory predicts and then test it against empirical patterns, showing strengths and limits. Where the question invites it, bring in methodological issues — for example, whether official statistics can be trusted to describe ethnicity patterns — and link these to theory and policy. Use contemporary and local examples where appropriate; a Welsh illustration can be particularly persuasive if it is relevant to the question. In evaluation, balance criticism with counterarguments: a theory may explain immediate causes but fail at structural level, or vice versa. Time management is crucial: spend proportionally more time on higher-mark questions, and leave a few minutes to check that you have answered the precise focus of the question. Finally, practice writing synoptic answers that connect crime and deviance to other units you have studied, such as socialisation, education and social inequality, because examiners reward well-integrated, evidence-rich responses.
