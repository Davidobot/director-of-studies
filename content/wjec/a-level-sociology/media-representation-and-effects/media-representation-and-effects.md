# The media: representation and effects (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## What sociologists mean by “the media” and why it matters
When sociologists talk about the media they mean the range of institutions and technologies that produce and circulate information, ideas and images: newspapers and magazines, television and radio, films, advertising, video games and the wide array of digital and social media platforms. The media are important because they help shape how people understand the world, define social problems and construct identities. Media do not simply reflect reality; they select, frame and repeat particular versions of events, people and groups. Understanding the media therefore helps explain how wider patterns of socialisation, values and power are reproduced or challenged across society. In A-level sociology you are expected to show this awareness and to link media processes to the themes of culture, identity, social differentiation and power.

## Ownership, control and the production of news
A key area of study is who owns and controls media organisations and how this affects content. Ownership concentration, where a handful of large companies control many news outlets, raises questions about diversity of perspectives and the influence of commercial or political interests on reporting. The routines of media professionals — editors, reporters, producers — also shape news: journalists rely on sources, follow deadlines, use official press releases and apply newsroom news values such as negativity, prominence, novelty and proximity when deciding what to cover. Advertisers and the need to attract audiences further shape what is produced. Political economy perspectives argue that the interests of owners and advertisers will bias media output, while pluralist perspectives contend that competition and audience choice produce a plurality of voices. In practice, both processes operate: commercial pressures narrow some kinds of coverage while digital platforms and smaller outlets create new spaces for alternative voices.

## Representation: who gets seen and how
Representation refers to the ways social groups are portrayed in media content. These portrayals influence how audiences think about class, gender, ethnicity, age, disability and nationality. Stereotyping, tokenism and absence are common problems: some groups are over-represented as criminals or victims, others are confined to subordinate or trivial roles, and some experiences are simply missing from mainstream coverage. Feminist critics highlight how women are often sexualised or marginalised and point to “symbolic annihilation” where whole groups are ignored. Analyses of ethnicity often reveal patterns of criminalisation or exoticisation, while class is frequently rendered invisible or moralised. Contemporary debates show intersectionality matters: representations depend on the combined effects of gender, ethnicity, age and class, so a black woman’s media representation cannot be understood solely through race or gender alone. For students, it is useful to link claims about representation to concrete examples — campaign coverage, drama portrayals, advertising trends — and to show how framing and selection shape public understanding.

## Theories of media effects and audience responses
Sociology offers several ways of explaining how media influence audiences. Early models like the hypodermic syringe suggested direct, powerful effects, but research since then has shown a more complex picture. Two-step flow theory draws attention to opinion leaders who interpret media messages for others, while uses and gratifications focus on active audiences who select media to meet needs such as information, identity or entertainment. Cultivation theory argues that long-term exposure to consistent media messages shapes people’s perceptions of social reality, producing common “mean world” views in heavy consumers. Marxist and neo-Marxist approaches emphasise the ideological role of media in reproducing dominant class interests and consent; Stuart Hall’s encoding/decoding model shows that producers encode messages within dominant meanings, yet audiences can accept, negotiate or resist them, producing different readings. Feminist theories stress gendered power relations in content and production, and postmodernist accounts highlight fragmentation, plurality and the blurring of fact and fiction in a highly mediated culture. When answering exam questions, you should link these theoretical models to evidence and show their strengths and limitations.

## New media, globalisation and changing patterns of influence
Digital technologies and global networks have transformed media production, distribution and consumption. Social media platforms, streaming services and user-generated content have expanded the range of voices and made media more interactive. Algorithms now shape what users see, creating filter bubbles and echo chambers that can reinforce existing beliefs. Citizen journalism has opened up opportunities for alternative reporting, as seen when grassroots footage shapes mainstream coverage of protests or disasters. At the same time global conglomerates and platform dominance raise new concerns about concentrated power, data collection, targeted advertising and the commercialisation of attention. Globalisation means that cultural products and news travel more widely, producing both homogenisation of some content and hybrid local-global forms. For a Welsh or UK focus, consider how global platforms affect local news provision and how Welsh-language media or devolved political debates are represented in national and global outlets.

## Regulation, policy and the public sphere
Media operate within legal and regulatory frameworks that aim to balance freedom of expression with responsibilities such as accuracy, harm prevention and plurality. Public service broadcasting traditions stress the role of media in informing citizens and supporting democratic debate, while regulatory bodies set standards and sometimes intervene on ownership or content. Policy debates in the UK and Wales consider the sustainability of local journalism, safeguards for children online, and the regulation of platforms. Media literacy is frequently proposed as a policy response, encouraging audiences to evaluate sources, spot bias and understand algorithms. In essays, it is useful to show how policy can both constrain and enable media practices, and to discuss whether regulation should prioritise market freedom, cultural diversity or democratic inclusion.

## Case studies and connecting theory to evidence
Strong answers combine theoretical claims with specific examples. Case studies such as coverage of social movements like Black Lives Matter or #MeToo, reporting around migration, representations of disability in soap operas or advertising, and debates over disinformation during elections, serve to illustrate how media construct meanings and can produce real social effects. Empirical data include content analyses showing frequency of certain portrayals, audience studies revealing different readings, and ownership maps that show concentration. When using case studies, be precise: describe the media content or event, explain which sociological concepts apply, show the connection to wider social processes and assess the limits of the evidence. Bringing in a Welsh perspective can strengthen answers: discuss how Welsh identity appears in national outlets, the role of Welsh-language broadcasting, or local news decline in Welsh communities.

## Exam technique
To score well, begin by reading the question carefully and underlining command words such as “explain”, “evaluate” or “assess”. Plan a clear structure with an introduction that frames your argument and states the key concepts you will use. In the main body, develop coherent paragraphs that combine sociological theory, contemporary examples and evaluation. Always show AO1 by defining key terms and outlining relevant theories, AO2 by applying those theories to examples and AO3 by analysing strengths, weaknesses and alternative explanations. Use named theories where appropriate (for example, hypodermic model, two-step flow, encoding/decoding, cultivation, Marxist critique) and explain them concisely. Balance your answer by considering opposing views: a paragraph that contrasts a determinist effects model with audience-centred approaches or shows how new media both empower users and concentrate power will gain marks. Make explicit links to the question throughout and avoid long descriptive passages that are not analytical. Include a short conclusion that summarises your judgement and refers back to the question. Time your exam so longer, higher-mark questions get proportionately more planning and evidence, and where relevant, remember to make a Welsh or local reference to show contextual awareness. Finally, practice past-style questions under timed conditions, annotate model answers to learn how examples and evaluation are deployed, and build a small bank of up-to-date media examples you can adapt in different essays.
