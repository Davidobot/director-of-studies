# Religion and secularisation (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: why religion matters in sociology
Religion remains an important substantive topic in A-level sociology because it touches on identity, socialisation, social cohesion and conflict, and the distribution of power and resources. Sociologists study religion not to adjudicate truth claims but to explain how religious beliefs and organisations are produced, maintained and transformed, and how they interact with other social institutions such as the family, education, the media and the state. In the UK context students should be able to draw on contemporary examples including falling church attendance, the rise of those identifying with “no religion”, religiously affiliated schools, public debates about religious dress and faith-based welfare provision, and differences in religiosity by age, gender, ethnicity and class, including specific Welsh contexts where appropriate.

## Key sociological perspectives on religion
Functionalist theory treats religion as a source of social cohesion and shared values. Emile Durkheim’s approach emphasises how ritual and collective worship reinforce social solidarity and a sense of belonging, while later functionalists argue that religion helps to socialise individuals into moral codes that support social order. Marxist perspectives, in contrast, focus on religion’s role in maintaining class inequality. Religion is interpreted as an ideology that calms oppressed groups by promising rewards in an afterlife and by distracting attention from material exploitation. Weberian theory offers a more nuanced view by linking certain religious ideas to social change; Max Weber famously argued that aspects of Protestantism helped shape the ethos necessary for the development of capitalism, while more generally highlighting how religious ideas can both support and challenge economic systems. Feminist analyses criticise mainstream religions for patriarchy and gendered power relations, exploring how religious doctrines and institutions often legitimate unequal gender roles while also noting women’s active participation in religious life. Postmodernist and contemporary cultural approaches stress the plural and fragmented nature of modern religious experience, focusing on spiritualities, bricolage and individualized belief rather than institutional religion.

## Patterns and trends in religiosity
Across many Western societies, including Wales and the rest of the UK, long-term patterns show declines in formal religious practice such as weekly church attendance and sacramental participation. At the same time, the proportion of people who identify with having no religion has grown, especially among younger cohorts. However, trends are uneven. Ethnic minority communities tend to report higher levels of religious belief and practice compared with the white majority, and gender differences persist with women generally more likely to participate in organised religion than men. Age is a strong correlate: older people usually show higher levels of religiosity. Immigration, globalisation and transnational ties have also introduced new religious traditions and revitalised existing ones, resulting in religious pluralism in urban areas. In addition, there are parallel trends of spiritual seeking and individualized forms of religiosity—people who identify as “spiritual but not religious” pursue personal forms of meaning outside traditional institutions. In a Welsh context, while formal affiliation and attendance have declined over the long term, religion still plays a role in public ceremonies and local identity for some communities, and faith networks continue to provide voluntary and welfare services.

## Secularisation: concepts and empirical evidence
Secularisation can be understood in several related ways: decline in religious belief and practice among the population, decline in the social significance and authority of religious institutions, and the differentiation of religion from other spheres of life (for example, law, education and politics). Empirical evidence cited in support of the secularisation thesis includes falling church attendance, reduced influence of clergy on public policy, and the privatization of belief—religion becoming a matter of personal choice rather than a dominant public framework. Institutional secularisation is visible where state institutions operate independently of religious control and where civil law is not based on religious doctrine. Yet the picture is complex and contested. Some sociologists argue that while institutional religion in some countries has declined, religion has simply changed form: new religious movements, Pentecostal growth in parts of the world, and the persistence of religious identities among immigrant communities suggest that secularisation is neither universal nor inevitable. Students should be prepared to weigh different types of evidence and recognise that trends may vary cross-nationally and within the UK.

## Explaining secularisation and its limits
Classical explanations for secularisation include structural differentiation, rationalisation and the rise of scientific worldviews. Structural differentiation describes how modern societies develop specialised institutions—education, healthcare, law—that reduce dependence on religious institutions for social functions. Rationalisation refers to the growing authority of scientific and bureaucratic reasoning over religious explanations. Rational choice and religious market theories provide a different account: they suggest that religious decline in some places results from monopolistic or complacent religious institutions, whereas competition between religious providers can stimulate vitality. Cultural explanations highlight the role of individualism and consumerism in shaping religious life: people choose religious goods in ways similar to other consumer choices, leading to denominational switching and the growth of “pick-and-mix” spiritualities. Critiques of the secularisation thesis emphasise evidence of religious resilience: global religious revivals, the persistence of faith-based organisations in welfare provision, the continuing role of religion in political mobilisation in some contexts, and the fact that many people still use religious language or symbolism when making sense of life events. The Welsh and UK policy context provides useful material for evaluation, for instance debates over the place of religious education in schools, the presence of faith schools, and public recognition of religious festivals.

## Religious diversity, revival and new forms of belief
If older institutional forms of religion have weakened in some sectors, new forms and revivals have also emerged. Fundamentalist movements, charismatic and Pentecostal churches, and various new religious movements have shown growth in different regions. Global migration has revitalised religious life in many Western cities, bringing new places of worship and transnational religious networks. At the same time, the rise of individualized spirituality and therapy-oriented practices reflects a shift from external authority to personal meaning-making. Secularisation and revitalisation can coexist: a society may be more secular overall while pockets of intense religious activity flourish. Political and social developments can also trigger religious revival; perceived moral crises, economic insecurity, or identity politics may push individuals and groups toward religious communities that offer solidarity and clear moral frameworks.

## Religion, social control and social change
Religion functions both to stabilise social order and to generate social change. From a social control perspective, religious moral codes, rituals and institutions influence behaviour and reinforce norms; religious sanctioning of conduct can deter deviance and encourage conformity. Conversely, religion has been a source of dissent and progressive change. Liberation theology and faith-based civil-rights movements demonstrate how religious resources can mobilise communities and challenge injustice. Sociological analysis must therefore attend to the multiple social functions of religion: whether it serves as an ideological tool legitimating existing inequalities, a resource for protest and resistance, or a site of personal identity formation. Feminist critiques highlight how religion can institutionalise patriarchal norms, but they also note the ways in which women have used religious spaces for empowerment and leadership. In contemporary Britain, religion intersects with multicultural politics, raising questions about religious accommodation, freedom of expression and the role of faith-based organisations in public services.

## Methodological issues in studying religion
Studying religion presents particular methodological challenges. Quantitative surveys can measure affiliation and attendance but may miss the depth of belief or informal practices. Self-reported attendance often overstates actual attendance, and “identity” questions may conflate cultural belonging with active belief. Qualitative methods such as ethnography and in-depth interviews can capture meanings, rituals and lived religion but may lack generalisability. Researchers must also decide how to define religion for empirical work: institutional belonging, belief, practice, or spiritual orientation. Comparative research requires sensitivity to national and cultural differences; a pattern observed in one country may not hold elsewhere. Ethical issues are prominent when researching belief communities, requiring respect for confidentiality and sensitivity to cultural practices. For A-level sociology, appreciating these methodological limits strengthens evaluation in essays and enables more nuanced conclusions about secularisation claims.

## Exam technique
When answering religion and secularisation questions, begin by defining key terms such as religion, secularisation, religiosity, and the specific focus of the question. Use clear sociological theory: identify relevant perspectives (functionalism, Marxism, Weberian, feminist, postmodern) and explain how each interprets religion and secularisation. Apply empirical evidence to support points and, where possible, refer to UK or Welsh examples to demonstrate context-specific knowledge. Balance your answer by evaluating theories and evidence: consider counter-evidence, alternative explanations and methodological weaknesses. For essays, structure your response with an introduction that frames the debate, several developed paragraphs that combine theory, evidence and evaluation, and a conclusion that addresses the question directly, offering a reasoned judgement. In data-response or short-source questions, interpret the source material, link it to sociological concepts, and assess its limitations. Manage your time so that longer essays allow space for at least two perspectives plus counter-arguments and a final evaluative paragraph. Where appropriate, bring in contemporary debates such as the rise of “no religion”, religious pluralism, and the role of religion in public life to show breadth of knowledge. Clear definitions, explicit application, and sustained evaluation earn the higher mark bands.
