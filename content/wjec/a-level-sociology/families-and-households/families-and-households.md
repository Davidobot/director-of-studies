# Families and households (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: why study families and households?
Families and households are central to sociology because they are where most people first learn how to behave, form identities and experience social relationships. At A-level you will explore how families are organised, how they vary, how they have changed over time and how they are linked to wider social structures such as class, gender, ethnicity, the economy and the state. Studying families and households helps you develop the “sociological imagination” by connecting personal experiences—such as leaving home, parenting or divorce—to wider social patterns and policies in England and Wales and, where relevant, Wales in particular. Keep in mind that the topic is approached through two recurring themes of the specification: socialisation, culture and identity; and social differentiation, power and stratification. These themes run through descriptions, explanations and debates about family life.

## Family forms and diversity
The term family is used in different ways: it can mean a household (people living together) or a kinship network (people related by blood, marriage or choice). Common family and household forms you need to know include the nuclear family (two parents and dependent children), the extended family (three or more generations or wider kin living together or maintaining close ties), lone-parent families, reconstituted or stepfamilies, same-sex parent families, and households of single adults or cohabiting couples without children. Contemporary sociologists also use terms such as “beanpole family” to describe long but narrow family trees with more generations alive but fewer siblings in each generation, a consequence of lower fertility and greater life expectancy.

Diversity within families arises from differences in class, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as life-course variations such as age, marital status and household composition. In Wales and across the UK, you should be able to recognise and explain variation between regions and social groups: for example, differences in household size, prevalence of multi-generational households, or patterns of cohabitation and marriage among different ethnic communities. The postmodern perspective encourages you to think about the increasing diversity and fluidity of family forms, emphasising choice and individualisation in family life.

## Demographic change: trends and causes
Family and household patterns have shifted significantly over the last fifty years. Key demographic changes include later marriage and childbearing, rising cohabitation, higher divorce rates followed by a period of stabilization, increased life expectancy, lower fertility and a growing number of people living alone. These trends are interrelated and have multiple causes.

Social explanations highlight changing attitudes and values: secularisation, greater acceptance of cohabitation and divorce, and the rise of individualism. Economic explanations point to women’s increased participation in education and paid work, higher housing costs and insecure employment which influence decisions about marriage and parenthood. Technological and medical developments, such as reliable contraception and assisted reproductive technologies, have reshaped family planning. Legal and policy changes—changes to divorce law, the introduction of civil partnerships and later same-sex marriage, and welfare provisions—have also had a direct impact on family structures. Global factors, including migration and the spread of cultural norms through media and travel, contribute to diversity and change.

Consider the consequences of demographic change: ageing populations place pressure on care services and the labour market, smaller household sizes affect housing demand, and changing family structures reconfigure patterns of socialisation and welfare dependency.

## Relationships, roles and socialisation within families
Families are primary sites of socialisation where children learn language, norms, values and social roles. Primary socialisation occurs mainly in early childhood within the family; secondary socialisation happens later via schools, peers, media and work. Identity is shaped by family influences and intersecting factors such as gender, class and ethnicity. For example, parents’ social class influences children’s educational opportunities and cultural capital, while ethnic and national identities, including Welsh identity, are often transmitted through family practices, language and celebrations.

The division of labour within families—how paid work, domestic labour and childcare are shared—remains a central issue. Traditional models assign instrumental (breadwinner) and expressive (caregiver) roles, but gender roles have shifted as more women participate in paid employment and as fathers take on greater childcare responsibilities. Despite change, research often finds an unequal “double burden” for many women who combine paid work with a larger share of domestic work. Power relations within households can be analysed in terms of decision-making, control of resources and experiences of care or domestic abuse. Family relationships are therefore sites of both support and potential conflict.

## Theoretical perspectives on families and households
Different sociological theories offer contrasting interpretations of the family’s role in society. Functionalist perspectives, drawing on writers such as Parsons, argue that the nuclear family performs essential functions for social stability: socialising children, stabilising adult personalities and regulating sexual behaviour. From this perspective, changes such as rising divorce are seen as disruptive.

Marxist and neo-Marxist approaches view the family in relation to capitalism: families reproduce labour power, socialise future workers, and serve the needs of capitalist economy by maintaining and consuming goods. Feminist theories place gender and patriarchy at the centre of analysis. Radical feminists argue that the family functions to sustain male domination, with domestic labour and unpaid care reproducing women’s subordinate position. Liberal feminists emphasise reforms to achieve greater gender equality within families, while Marxist feminists combine class and gender explanations to show how capitalism benefits from women’s unpaid labour.

The New Right presents a conservative critique, emphasising the importance of the traditional nuclear family for social order and arguing that family breakdown results from moral decline and state interference. Postmodernist approaches and the individualisation thesis, in contrast, highlight greater choice, fluid family forms and the decline of grand narratives; they stress that people construct their family lives in diverse, often personalized ways. When evaluating theories, remember to consider evidence that supports diversity and change, including intersections with class, ethnicity and nation.

## Social policy, law and contemporary issues (with a Welsh perspective)
Government policies and laws strongly influence family life. Policies affecting families include marriage and partnership legislation, parental leave, childcare provision, housing and welfare benefits. The legal recognition of same-sex partnerships, changes to divorce procedures and reforms to welfare have all altered the incentives and constraints shaping family choices. In Wales, devolved powers mean some policy areas—such as certain aspects of childcare, social services and community family support—can have different emphases compared to England. When studying families you should be ready to discuss how Welsh Government initiatives, local services and community provision might affect family life differently from wider UK policies.

Contemporary issues you will encounter include the impact of austerity and welfare reform on low-income families, the role of child protection and state intervention in cases of abuse, debates over childcare affordability and availability, and the challenges of caring for an ageing population. Migration patterns also create transnational families and reshape household compositions. Teaching and exam answers benefit from concrete examples: how policy changes influence decisions to work, care and form households, and how these effects vary across social groups.

## Research and evidence: methods applied to family studies
Families are studied using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include large-scale surveys, census data and official statistics that reveal patterns such as fertility rates, household composition and employment among parents. These sources are valuable for identifying trends and making comparisons between regions, social classes and ethnic groups. Qualitative methods, such as in-depth interviews, ethnographies and life histories, provide rich insights into family relationships, meanings of parenthood, and the lived experience of domestic labour or caregiving. Longitudinal studies are particularly useful for tracking how family life changes over time and for understanding life-course transitions, for example from cohabitation to marriage or from full-time parenting to re-entry into employment.

Methodological debates important for exam answers include issues of reliability, validity, representativeness, ethics and access. For example, researching families requires sensitivity to privacy and consent; observing family interactions may raise ethical problems around deception or intrusion. When using evidence in essays, combine statistics that show scale or trend with qualitative findings that illustrate mechanisms and meanings. Where possible, link the choice of method to the research question: use surveys to measure prevalence and interviews to explore attitudes and experiences.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on families and households requires a clear combination of knowledge, application and evaluation. Begin short-answer questions by defining key terms and immediately applying them to the context given—mention England and Wales or a Welsh example where appropriate. For essay questions, plan a coherent argument: introduce the focus, define terms and outline the theoretical perspectives you will use. Develop each paragraph around one clear point: state a claim, explain it using theory, apply it with evidence or an example, and then evaluate by considering counter-evidence, limitations or alternative explanations. Always aim to balance perspectives; a mark-worthy essay typically compares at least two theoretical approaches and considers diverse social factors such as class, gender, ethnicity and age.

Make use of research methods knowledge: when asked to evaluate evidence or policies, refer to the strengths and weaknesses of the studies or data. If a question asks for contemporary examples, use up-to-date but general examples if you cannot recall precise figures. Time management is essential: read the question carefully for command words (explain, evaluate, assess), allocate time according to the marks available, and leave time to write a brief conclusion that brings together your main points and reaches a judgement. Practice writing concise introductions and conclusions, and practise applying theory to specific scenarios—this will make your essays both analytical and grounded in evidence, which is exactly what examiners on the WJEC / Eduqas specification are looking for.
