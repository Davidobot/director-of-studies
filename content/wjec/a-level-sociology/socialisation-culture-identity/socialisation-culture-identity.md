# Socialisation, culture and identity (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## The theme in context
Socialisation, culture and identity is one of the two core threads that runs through the WJEC / Eduqas A-level Sociology specification. It asks how people learn to be members of society, how shared ways of life are produced and changed, and how individual and group identities are formed and negotiated. This theme should be studied with contemporary examples and, where relevant, with reference to Wales. Understanding it gives you tools to explain everyday behaviour, public controversies and policy debates — from debates about language and national identity in Wales to concerns about youth behaviour, media influence and changing family patterns. In exams you will be expected to show knowledge of key concepts, apply sociological ideas to concrete examples, and evaluate competing explanations.

## The social construction of culture
Culture is the “way of life” of a group: the shared norms, values, beliefs, symbols, language, dress and practices that shape behaviour and meaning. Sociologists emphasise that culture is socially constructed rather than biologically determined. The nature/nurture debate is central here: cases of children raised with minimal social contact, sometimes referred to as feral children, are used to illustrate how social interaction is necessary for developing language, emotions and a sense of self. Culture varies across societies and over time: food, music and dress change with globalisation, while traditions and heritage contribute to a sense of continuity. Cultural diversity appears in the existence of subcultures and alternative lifestyles, from longstanding ethnic communities and Welsh-language culture to more transient youth subcultures. Cultural change can be gradual or rapid; migration, economic shifts, technology and media are major drivers of this change. Understanding culture as constructed helps explain why what counts as normal or deviant varies across contexts and historical periods.

## Processes and agencies of socialisation
Socialisation is the lifelong process by which individuals acquire the skills, knowledge and dispositions needed to participate in society. Primary socialisation takes place in early childhood, most commonly within the family, where children learn language, basic norms and gender roles through role models, imitation and both positive and negative sanctions. Secondary socialisation happens later through institutions such as schools, peer groups, the workplace, religion and the media. Schools teach formal rules, routines and qualifications but also transmit hidden curricula: attitudes, expectations and social norms that prepare pupils for particular roles in society. Peer groups provide a context for experimenting with identity and developing status among equals. The media reach large audiences, shaping ideas about lifestyle, body image, risk and morality and sometimes producing moral panics around particular behaviours. Religion and work also socialise individuals by embedding moral codes and occupational values.

Social control operates through formal mechanisms such as laws and sanctions and through informal mechanisms such as gossip, social approval and cultural expectations. Processes of cultural transmission — how norms and values pass from one generation to the next — are not automatic; they are contested and may produce different outcomes depending on class, gender, ethnicity or national context. In Wales, language policies and bilingual education are important examples of deliberate cultural transmission, where schools and local institutions play a central role in maintaining and revitalising Welsh identity.

## Identity: personal and social
Identity refers to how individuals see themselves (personal identity) and how they are seen as members of groups (social identity). Socialisation shapes identity by providing roles, labels and status positions. Identities are multiple and intersecting: people simultaneously inhabit identities associated with gender, class, ethnicity, age and nationality. Gender identity is formed through family expectations, educational practices and media representations that define femininity and masculinity. Class identity can be reinforced by material conditions, cultural tastes and occupational roles; Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of cultural capital helps explain how tastes and dispositions are linked to social position. Ethnic identity may be expressed through language, religion, and cultural practices; migration and diasporas can create hybrid identities that draw on more than one cultural tradition.

Nationality and regional identities matter in the UK context. Welsh identity, for example, can be expressed through language, cultural festivals, sport and political attachments. Devolution and Welsh government policies influence how people in Wales experience education, health and cultural life, which in turn feed into identity formation. Identities are not fixed; they are negotiated and can change across situations. Social processes such as labelling, stereotyping and discrimination affect how identities are experienced and lived, and sociologists emphasise the need to understand both how identities are constructed and how individuals resist, adapt or transform imposed identities.

## Youth cultures and families: applied areas of study
Studying youth cultures and families provides concrete ways to explore the broader theme of socialisation and culture. Youth cultures are collective styles and practices through which young people construct identities and boundaries. Historical examples such as mods and rockers in the 1960s and punk in the 1970s illustrate how styles, music and leisure can become symbolic oppositions. Contemporary youth formations are often more fluid; the concept of neo-tribes describes loosely organised networks of style-based groups that form around consumption, nightlife or online communities rather than fixed subcultural membership. Economic changes, global media, digital technologies and class differences shape youth cultures and the risks that young people face, including involvement in delinquency or marginalisation.

Families and households are primary sites of socialisation and have themselves changed considerably. Demographic trends in the UK and Wales — such as changes in marriage and divorce rates, increased cohabitation, lower fertility and greater ethnic and family diversity — affect the experience of childhood and adulthood. Theoretical debates explore whether the nuclear family remains dominant, how gender roles within households are changing, and how economic pressures influence family life. Sociological approaches emphasise that family life is not just a private matter but is shaped by public policy, labour markets and cultural expectations. For example, social policies on childcare, parental leave and housing have direct consequences for family practices and for inequalities in the distribution of care and opportunities.

## Theoretical perspectives on culture and socialisation
Sociological theory gives competing explanations of how culture and identity are produced. Functionalist perspectives argue that socialisation and institutions promote social order by teaching shared norms and values, creating social cohesion and integrating individuals into a stable social system. Marxist and neo-Marxist approaches focus on power and inequality, seeing socialisation as a mechanism through which ruling-class ideas become common sense and through which capitalism reproduces class structures. Feminist theories highlight how gendered socialisation reproduces patriarchal relations and how experiences vary for women and men according to intersecting inequalities. Interactionist perspectives concentrate on the micro-level processes by which identity is created through everyday interactions, labelling and the internalisation of others’ expectations; they emphasise the role of agency in constructing self-identity. Postmodernist approaches stress fragmentation, consumer choice and the fluidity of identity in late modernity, arguing that traditional grand narratives break down and individuals increasingly assemble identities from diverse cultural resources. The New Right perspective views socialisation as fundamental for instilling personal responsibility and emphasises the importance of traditional family structures. Each perspective offers tools for analysing different aspects of socialisation, and higher-level answers in exams will compare and evaluate these competing accounts.

## Research methods and using evidence on culture
Understanding methods is essential for studying socialisation and culture and for answering Unit 2 and Unit 4 questions. Sociologists use quantitative methods such as questionnaires and surveys to measure patterns and trends, and qualitative methods such as interviews, focus groups and participant observation to explore meanings, identities and processes in depth. Ethnography is particularly useful for studying culture because it allows researchers to observe everyday practices and interactions over time. Longitudinal studies can reveal how identities and attitudes change across life courses. Secondary sources, including official statistics and documents, are also important: in Wales, government datasets and local policy reports can provide evidence about education, language use and demographic change.

When designing research, you need to consider sampling, representativeness and generalisability. Practical and ethical issues — access, informed consent, confidentiality, protection from harm — matter especially when studying vulnerable groups such as children or those with disabilities. Theories of research — positivism, interpretivism and realism — help explain why researchers choose particular methods and what kinds of claims can be made. Methodological pluralism and triangulation are valuable strategies for combining methods to strengthen the validity of findings. In exams you will be asked to evaluate methods and to apply methodological knowledge to realistic research scenarios, including justifying a chosen method, identifying potential problems and discussing how to present findings.

## Exam technique
In answering questions on socialisation, culture and identity you must show three linked skills: knowledge (AO1), application (AO2) and analysis/evaluation (AO3). Start short answer responses by defining key terms clearly and immediately applying them to a relevant example, preferably one that could be located in Wales when appropriate. For methods or stimulus-based questions, describe the method accurately and consider its strengths and limitations in context. For essay-style questions, structure your response with a brief introduction that outlines your argument, several developed paragraphs that link theory to evidence and examples, and a conclusion that draws together your evaluation. When deploying theory, show how each perspective explains the issue, use empirical examples to support or challenge the theoretical claim, and evaluate by exploring rival explanations, methodological limitations, or changing social contexts. Time management matters: for 30-mark essays aim to spend a proportionate amount of time planning, writing and reviewing; for evaluation, balance strengths with weaknesses and avoid long lists of unlinked points. Where possible, include named concepts (for example, cultural capital, labelling, moral panic, neo-tribes) and brief reference to research methods or studies to demonstrate breadth and depth. Always be ready to adapt examples to the question’s focus, making explicit comparisons or references to Wales when this will strengthen your argument.
