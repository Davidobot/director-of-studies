# Education: attainment, inequality and policy (A-level Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview and aims of the specification
This WJEC/Eduqas A‑level specification places sociology squarely in the present day, encouraging students to think critically about contemporary social life while paying attention to Wales where appropriate. The course is organised around two overarching themes that run through every unit: the processes of socialisation, culture and identity; and the processes of social differentiation, power and stratification. Through these themes learners develop not only knowledge of concepts and social institutions but also practical research skills and the ability to apply, analyse and evaluate sociological explanations. The specification explicitly values breadth and depth: students are expected to know key theories and research methods in reasonable detail, to deploy them to explain patterns of social life, and to judge their strengths and limitations. This combination of content and skills makes the subject useful for progression to higher education, social research and many careers where evidence‑based argument and critical thinking matter.

## AS Unit 1: Acquiring culture — socialisation, identity, families and youth
The first AS unit concentrates on cultural transmission and how identities are formed. You will study the idea of culture as a way of life and learn the language of sociology — norms, values, beliefs, roles and status — together with visible cultural markers such as dress, language and music. The unit emphasises the social construction of culture, exploring classical nature/nurture debates through familiar examples such as feral children or rapid social change. Primary socialisation within the family and secondary socialisation via peers, education, the media, religion and work are central to understanding how people acquire a sense of self. The section on identity requires you to distinguish personal identity from social identity and to explore how gender, class, ethnicity and nationality (including Welsh identity) shape the self.

Section B of Unit 1 develops these ideas through a focused study of either families and households or youth cultures. Families and households are examined in terms of form and diversity, demographic change (marriage, divorce, cohabitation, fertility and life expectancy) and the impact of changing relationships on policy and everyday life. Theories from functionalism to feminism and the New Right provide different explanations for family change and for the distribution of domestic labour and power. If you choose youth cultures, you will map the influences that produce distinctive youth identities, from media and economic change to class and gender; you will explore subcultures and neo‑tribes and consider explanations of youth deviance and styles of resistance using interactionist, Marxist and postmodern perspectives. Throughout, using contemporary and local (Welsh/UK) examples strengthens arguments and helps you apply abstract theory to lived experience.

## AS Unit 2: Methods and Understanding Society — research skills plus education, media or religion
Unit 2 combines a compulsory methods section with an optional substantive area. The compulsory methods material requires detailed knowledge of methodological concepts such as validity, reliability, generalisability, representativeness and objectivity. You are expected to be fluent about primary quantitative and qualitative methods — questionnaires, interviews, focus groups and observation — and about designs including surveys, ethnography and longitudinal studies. Secondary data sources from official statistics and documents are examined alongside sampling techniques, both representative approaches (for example stratified or random procedures) and non‑representative approaches (for example purposive or snowball sampling). Ethical issues such as informed consent, confidentiality and protection from harm are emphasised, as are practical constraints of time, cost and access. The specification invites you to compare positivist and interpretivist approaches and to understand methodological pluralism and triangulation as responses to research problems.

In the substantive section you will study one of education, the media or religion in detail. The education option asks you to explain the role and functions of schooling, patterns of differential attainment by class, gender and ethnicity, and the influence of material and cultural factors and labelling processes. The media option looks at ownership and control, professional practices, audience effects and representations of social groups, including new media and globalisation. The religion option examines participation trends, organisational forms (denominations, new religious movements, secularisation) and the social role of religion. For each option you must be able to deploy theoretical perspectives — for example functionalist, Marxist, interactionist, feminist or postmodernist — and to use evidence, including Welsh or UK statistics where available, to analyse and evaluate claims.

## A2 Unit 3: Power and Control — crime, health, politics and world sociology
The A2 units focus more heavily on power, differentiation and stratification. Unit 3 pursues these themes through one of several options. The crime and deviance option explores the social distribution of offending and victimisation by class, gender, ethnicity and age, the measurement of crime using official statistics and surveys, and theoretical explanations from functionalism and strain theory to right and left realism and postmodern accounts of criminality and moral panics. The health and disability option examines patterns of health and illness, social determinants, medicalisation and the role of professionals, as well as inequalities in access to care and the effects of health policy.

A politics option appears in the specification historically and was assessed for the final time in summer 2021; it considered political participation, party politics, pressure groups and competing theories of power such as pluralism and elite theory. The world sociology option shifts to global inequalities in development, exploring causes of poverty and patterns of health, education and employment worldwide and evaluating perspectives such as modernisation, dependency and world‑systems theory. Across all options you will be expected to relate theory to evidence, to explain how power shapes social life, and to consider how policy responds to or reproduces inequalities.

## A2 Unit 4: Social Inequality and Applied Methods — designing research and explaining inequality
Unit 4 carries the largest weighting and combines an applied research methods task with an extended study of social inequality. The applied methods section asks you to design and justify a piece of sociological research: you must demonstrate the ability to operationalise concepts, select and justify methods, choose an appropriate sampling strategy, anticipate ethical and practical problems and evaluate strengths and limitations. Examiners expect clear linkage between the research question, proposed methods and the consequences of those choices for validity and reliability; you should also be able to suggest how collected data might be presented and interpreted.

The social inequality section requires you to marshal empirical evidence and statistics to show how class, gender, ethnicity, age and nation intersect to produce unequal outcomes across education, work, health and wealth. You will need to evaluate competing theories of stratification — from functionalist and New Right arguments about role allocation and meritocracy to Marxist and neo‑Marxist analyses of exploitation, Weberian accounts of status and life chances, feminist critiques of patriarchy, and postmodern scepticism about grand narratives. Strong answers integrate theory with up‑to‑date examples and critically assess the explanatory power of each perspective.

## Assessment structure and objectives
The course is unitised with staged assessment. The two AS units contribute 40% of the A‑level and the two A2 units deliver the remaining 60%. In terms of time, Unit 1 is 1 hour 15 minutes and carries 15% of the A‑level, Unit 2 is 2 hours and 25% of the A‑level, Unit 3 is 2 hours and 25% of the A‑level, and Unit 4 is 2 hours 15 minutes and 35% of the A‑level. Question styles vary: Unit 1 combines a short structured question on concepts with an essay option; Unit 2 includes a compulsory methods question based on stimulus material plus option essays and data questions; Unit 3 follows the theme of power with compulsory and essay questions in a chosen option; Unit 4 contains a compulsory applied methods design question and a substantial essay section on inequality.

Across the specification assessment objectives are split into demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1), application (AO2) and analysis and evaluation (AO3). For the full A‑level AO1 accounts for around 44% of marks, AO2 about 33% and AO3 about 23%, so while factual knowledge is vital, significant marks reward the ability to apply theory to evidence and to critically evaluate arguments. The unitised nature of the course also means candidates can resit units in later series, although there are rules governing multiple attempts and fresh starts, so it is important to plan entry and resit strategy with your teacher.

## Exam technique
Answering sociology examinations well depends on disciplined planning, precise use of sociological terms, and consistent linking between theory, evidence and evaluation. Always identify the command word in the question and target the appropriate assessment objective: describe and explain tasks need accurate AO1 knowledge and clear AO2 application, while “evaluate” or “assess” demands sustained AO3 judgement. Start extended essays with a brief plan that outlines the sequence of arguments and which theories and examples you will use; signpost your answer so the examiner can follow your reasoning.

Time management is crucial. For a typical 30–40 mark essay allow time to plan, write and leave a few minutes to add evaluative points or to tidy up references. Use relevant contemporary examples to illustrate abstract ideas: up‑to‑date statistics, well‑known studies, news stories or, when appropriate, Welsh or local data. Make sure examples are explained sociologically rather than simply asserted; link each example back to a theory or concept and show how it supports or challenges the argument.

In the applied methods question be systematic. Begin by restating the research question in operational terms and explain how key concepts will be measured. Justify the choice of method by discussing how it helps achieve validity, reliability or depth of understanding, and identify likely sampling strategies and the consequences for representativeness. Address ethics concretely: describe informed consent procedures, confidentiality safeguards and how you would protect vulnerable participants. When evaluating, compare alternative methods and show awareness of practical constraints such as time, cost and access; consider triangulation as a means of strengthening your study.

For data and stimulus questions, practice extracting the salient points quickly: identify trends, anomalies and what the evidence suggests about causation or bias. When discussing theory, avoid long undigested summaries; instead integrate theoretical claims with the data and use evaluation to weigh competing explanations. Short evaluative moves such as questioning assumptions, pointing out counter‑evidence, or considering the implications of methodology can lift an answer from descriptive to analytical.

Finally, practise past-style questions under timed conditions and seek feedback focused on the balance of AO1, AO2 and AO3. Regularly update your store of examples and practice applying multiple theories to a single issue so evaluation becomes comparative rather than merely adversarial. With careful planning, disciplined answer structure and a steady flow between concept, evidence and critical judgement, you will be able to meet the demands of this specification and demonstrate the sociological thinking examiners are looking for.
