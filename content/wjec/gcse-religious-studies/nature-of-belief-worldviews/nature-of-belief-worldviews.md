# Nature of belief and worldviews (GCSE Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## What we mean by belief and worldview
Belief and worldview are broader than simple faith or disbelief; they describe how individuals and communities make sense of existence, value, purpose and right action. A worldview brings together answers to ultimate questions about origins, purpose, morality and what, if anything, follows death. Within religious studies we encounter people who identify as theists, believing in one or more gods; monotheists, who believe in one God; polytheists, who believe in many gods; religious pluralists, who accept multiple valid religious paths; agnostics, who hold that the existence of God or the divine is unknown or unknowable; atheists, who deny the existence of deities; and humanists, who ground meaning and ethics in human experience without appeal to the divine. These categories overlap and are lived in many different ways: a person may accept some spiritual ideas while rejecting organised religion, or belong to a religious community without holding every theological detail literally.

## Reasons people believe or do not believe
People come to belief or non-belief for a variety of intellectual, emotional, social and experiential reasons. Some are persuaded by philosophical arguments, by perceived evidence in nature or history, or by the authority of religious texts and communities. Others are moved by personal experiences such as moments of awe, suffering that prompts search for meaning, or encounters with compassion and service that suggest a moral order. Conversely, some reject religious belief because of the problem of evil and suffering, because they find scientific explanations for the origins of the universe and life persuasive, or because of negative experiences with religious institutions. At GCSE level it is helpful to separate factors such as upbringing and community, philosophical reflection, emotional needs, and empirical evidence when explaining why someone believes or does not. Recognising that belief often combines rational and non-rational elements will help you explain real-life diversity without oversimplifying.

## Core concepts across religious traditions
Certain concepts recur across world religions, though they are understood differently in each tradition. Ideas about God or ultimate reality range from the personal, omnipotent God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam to the impersonal Brahman of many Hindu schools, to the non-theistic focus on awakening and the Dharma in Buddhism, and to the formless Waheguru of Sikhism. Related ideas include the soul or self, expressed as atman in Hindu thought and as a divine spark in many other faiths; the afterlife, with concepts such as heaven, hell, resurrection, moksha, nirvana or reincarnation; and moral responsibility, expressed through commandments, precepts, karma, or conscience. Sources of authority also vary: scriptures such as the Bible, Qur’an, Bhagavad Gita, Guru Granth Sahib and the Buddhist sutras; interpretive traditions like the Talmud, the Catechism, the Hadith and commentaries; and lived examples such as the teachings of Jesus, the Buddha, the Gurus or prophetic figures. Understanding how similar ideas are framed in different traditions — for example, the idea of moral law in the Ten Commandments, the Sharia, Natural Law or the Five Precepts — is an important skill for exam answers.

## How beliefs shape practice, identity and community
Beliefs are not only doctrinal statements; they shape everyday life through ritual, ethical action and communal identity. Practices such as prayer, pilgrimage, worship services, baptism, the Eucharist, puja, salah, and langar both express and form belief. Rites of passage—baptism, confirmation, bar or bat mitzvah, naming ceremonies, and funerals—link personal biography with a wider story of meaning and belonging. Religious identity is also visible in dress and dietary customs, such as the Sikh turban, Jewish kippah, Muslim hijab, kosher and halal rules, and vegetarian practices in many Hindu and Buddhist communities. For those with non-religious worldviews, identity and belonging often come through shared ethical commitments, humanist organisations, or engagement with causes and communities. The classroom should explore how symbolic actions and ethical commitments reinforce beliefs and create social cohesion, as well as how they can cause tension in plural societies where different worldviews coexist.

## Sources of authority and interpretation
Religious and non-religious worldviews rely on sources of authority to justify beliefs and moral choices. Sacred texts can be read literally, conservatively, or more liberally and contextually; for example, some Christians read Genesis as literal history while others read it as theological poetry. Within Catholic Christianity, additional sources such as the Catechism and papal teaching play a role. In Islam, the Qur’an and Hadiths guide belief and practice, while Judaism places great weight on the Torah, Talmud and rabbinic interpretation. Sikhism centres the Guru Granth Sahib, Hinduism draws on the Vedas and Upanishads among many texts, and Buddhism relies on the Dharma recorded in sutras and commentaries. Non-religious ethical systems look to reason, scientific knowledge, human experience and philosophical traditions such as utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics. When you discuss interpretation in essays, show how different interpretative approaches can lead to different stances on moral issues and daily practice.

## Belief, worldviews and moral decision-making
Most worldviews provide frameworks for making moral choices. Religious systems may appeal to divine commands, scriptures, conscience, or traditions. Christianity often emphasises love (agape), forgiveness and teachings such as the Parable of the Sheep and Goats when considering justice. Catholic thought uses Natural Law and the Catechism for moral reflection. Buddhism highlights the Noble Eightfold Path and the Five Precepts, with karma linking action and consequence. Hinduism refers to dharma and the four aims of life; Islam draws on the Qur’an, the Prophet’s example and concepts such as justice and mercy; Judaism uses mitzvot and rabbinic reasoning; Sikhism emphasises seva and honest living. Non-religious perspectives range from conscience-based reasoning to consequentialist calculations of harm and benefit. Debates such as abortion, euthanasia, animal rights and stewardship of the earth commonly bring these ethical systems into dialogue, and understanding the principles behind different responses will strengthen evaluative answers.

## Pluralism, tolerance and contemporary relevance
Living in a plural society means encountering a wide range of beliefs and practices. Religious pluralism recognises diversity and can be approached in multiple ways: some hold that many religions offer partial truths, others insist on exclusive truth claims. Education in religious studies emphasises empathy, resilience and the capacity to engage respectfully with difference. Concepts like cynefin, which roots people in local place and identity, help explain why local history and culture shape belief. Contemporary issues such as freedom of religious expression, changing family structures, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental crisis and human rights require students to relate classical teachings to modern contexts. Good revision connects doctrine with contemporary examples: how a Christian charity might interpret the call to help the poor, or how Islamic concepts of stewardship feed into environmental activism. Making these connections shows an appreciation of the lived reality of belief and its social consequences.

## Exam technique
To do well in GCSE Religious Studies, focus on clear structure, evidence, and evaluation. For AO1 answers give precise knowledge: define terms such as theism, agnosticism or karma, and refer to specific teachings, scriptures or practices. For AO2 apply that knowledge to the question’s context, explaining how a belief leads to a particular action or viewpoint. For AO3 show analysis and evaluation by considering strengths and weaknesses, alternative interpretations, and real-life implications; use key concepts such as theodicies, differing scriptural readings, or ethical principles to balance arguments. Always include examples from at least two traditions where the question asks for comparisons, and where possible include a non-religious perspective. Start longer answers with a brief plan and signpost your paragraphs so the examiner can follow your line of reasoning. Use brief quotations or named sources to support points, but explain their relevance. Time management is essential in timed exams: allocate time proportional to the marks, leave time to proofread and to add a concluding judgement that directly answers the question. For non-examined assessments select reliable, varied sources that show both belief and lived experience, justify your choices, and ensure reflective sections explain how your own views connect to the evidence. Practise writing balanced conclusions that reach a clear judgement, and use past papers to familiarise yourself with the style and expectations of WJEC / Eduqas assessments.
