# Christian beliefs, teachings and practices (GCSE Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

Christianity is the largest of the world religions studied on this course and its beliefs and practices shape the way millions of people understand God, humanity and the purpose of life. At the heart of Christian belief is the conviction that God is personal and loving, that God entered human history in the person of Jesus Christ, and that the Bible and church traditions provide guidance for worship, moral choices and community life. For GCSE purposes you should be able to explain key Christian teachings and compare how different Christian traditions (for example, mainstream Protestant churches and Roman Catholicism) interpret and apply those teachings in worship and daily life.

## The nature of God

Christians describe God using several classic attributes. God is understood to be the Creator of everything, having brought the universe into being without using pre-existing material (creation ex nihilo). God is described as omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), omnibenevolent (all-good) and omnipresent (present everywhere). These attributes help explain why Christians trust God for both the order of the world and moral guidance. Understanding these terms in plain language is useful: omnipotence means God can act without being limited by creatures; omniscience means God knows the past, present and future; omnibenevolence expresses God’s loving and moral commitment to creation.

A distinctive Christian doctrine is the Trinity: the belief that God is one in essence but exists in three persons—Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This is not three separate gods, but three persons who share the one divine nature. The Father is often spoken of as the source and sustainer, the Son as God made human in Jesus, and the Holy Spirit as God’s active presence in the world and in believers’ lives. Different traditions place different emphasis on how these persons relate, but all affirm the unity and mystery of the Trinity.

## Jesus: incarnation, ministry, death, resurrection and ascension

Central to Christian belief is that Jesus of Nazareth is both fully human and fully divine. Christians refer to this as the incarnation: God becoming human in the person of Jesus. The New Testament narratives describe his miraculous birth, his teaching and healing ministry, his crucifixion and death, and his resurrection from the dead. Christians call Jesus Messiah (the anointed one) and see him as the way to salvation: his life and sacrificial death reconcile humanity to God, and his resurrection promises new life beyond death.

The ministry of Jesus—his parables, actions and confrontations with religious authorities—illustrates the kingdom of God: a radical ethic of love, justice and mercy. The crucifixion is read as an atoning act that takes human sin seriously and makes forgiveness possible. The resurrection is the central Christian claim that death is defeated and that life after death is real; the ascension marks Jesus’ return to the Father and the sending of the Holy Spirit to empower the church. Be ready to give examples of Gospel stories that show Jesus’ teaching (for example, the Good Samaritan to illustrate agape love) and to explain why Christians regard the resurrection as proof of Jesus’ divine authority and the promise of life after death.

## The Bible, creeds and sources of authority

The Bible is the primary sacred text for Christians and functions as a source of wisdom, guidance and authority. Christians read the Bible in different ways: some adopt a literal reading, others a more conservative approach that values historical context, and others a liberal approach that focuses on moral and spiritual insights. Alongside Scripture, creeds such as the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed summarize central Christian convictions about God, Christ and salvation; they act as concise statements of faith used in worship and teaching.

Different Christian traditions also use additional sources of authority. Roman Catholicism places weight on the teaching office of the Pope, papal encyclicals and the Catechism as guides to doctrine and moral teaching. Protestant traditions may emphasise sola scriptura—the Bible as the final authority—while also valuing tradition and reason. When answering exam questions, show awareness that Christians appeal to Scripture, tradition and reason in different balances when resolving moral and theological questions.

## Human nature, the problem of evil and life after death

Christian anthropology teaches that humans are created in the image of God (imago Dei). This gives human life special dignity: people are rational, moral agents with free will and the capacity for relationship with God. At the same time, Christian teaching acknowledges that humans are fallen, that sin has distorted human nature and damaged relationships with God and others. These themes are used to explain suffering and moral failure in the world, and to motivate Christian practice of repentance, forgiveness and moral improvement.

The existence of evil and suffering raises important philosophical questions. The “problem of evil” challenges belief in an all-powerful, all-loving God. Christians have offered different theodicies—explanations that attempt to reconcile God with evil. The Augustinian theodicy stresses human free will and the idea that evil is a privation of good arising from misuse of freedom. The Irenaean or “soul-making” theodicy sees suffering as part of a developmental process that enables moral and spiritual growth. In exam answers you should be able to explain the problem clearly and outline these responses, noting strengths and weaknesses of each.

Belief about life after death is central for Christians. Most teach the hope of resurrection and eternal life with God, often contrasted with separation from God in Hell for those who reject God. Some traditions have doctrinal differences—for example, Roman Catholicism includes the doctrine of Purgatory as a purifying state before full communion with God. Christians derive comfort and ethical motivation from the promise that there will be a final judgement and a transformed creation.

## Christian worship, rites of passage and community life

Christian practice is the outward expression of belief. Worship services centre on prayer, Bible readings, preaching and sacraments. Baptism and the Eucharist (also called Holy Communion) are the two sacraments most widely recognised across Christian denominations. Baptism marks entry into the Christian community and may be practised for infants or as believers’ baptism for those who profess faith voluntarily. The Eucharist commemorates Jesus’ Last Supper and is interpreted in various ways: some traditions teach that bread and wine become the actual body and blood of Christ (transubstantiation in Catholicism), while others understand the elements as symbolic or as means of spiritual presence.

Christian rites of passage such as confirmation, marriage and funeral services provide communal recognition of important life stages. Funerals express mourning, commit the body to God and celebrate the deceased’s life, often including hymns, prayers and readings that reflect Christian hope in life after death. Pilgrimage is another expression of belonging and devotion; British Christians might visit St David’s in Wales or international sites such as Taizé for communal prayer and spiritual renewal. Participation in a worshipping community gives Christians a shared identity, moral support and opportunities for service.

## Christian ethics: love, law and social action

Christian moral teaching combines commandments, the example of Jesus and principles such as agape—self-giving, unconditional love. The Ten Commandments and Jesus’ summarising command to “love God and love your neighbour” form the ethical backbone for many Christians. Forgiveness and reconciliation are central virtues, while conscience and reason are used to apply teachings in new situations. Christians often appeal to divine command, natural law (especially in Catholic thought through Thomas Aquinas), and virtue ethics to justify moral positions.

Christianity has a long history of motivating charitable work and campaigning for justice. Teachings on stewardship and care for creation have led many churches to environmental action and practical projects such as supporting the poor. Organisations like Christian Aid and, in the Catholic tradition, CAFOD, show how faith inspires organised humanitarian work. Debates about wealth, stewardship and the “Preferential Option for the Poor” in Catholic social teaching are good examples to use when asked to explain how belief influences action.

Christian ethics also addresses modern issues—abortion, euthanasia, animal rights and medical research—where different Christian groups may reach different conclusions by balancing the sanctity of life, compassion, conscience and interpretations of Scripture. In exam answers it is important to explain the underlying principles and show how those principles lead to particular positions.

## Diversity within Christianity and comparisons with Catholic practice

Christianity is not a single, uniform tradition. Denominations such as Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, Orthodox and Roman Catholic carry shared beliefs but different practices and emphases. Catholics, for example, give a particularly strong role to the sacraments, to liturgy and to authoritative teaching through the Magisterium and the Catechism. Catholic theology has also developed distinct doctrines such as Purgatory and specific ethical frameworks like Natural Law as articulated by Aquinas. Protestant churches vary widely, from more liturgical forms to those that prioritise personal Bible study and congregational governance. When you compare Christianity and Catholicism in answers, focus on both doctrinal continuities (belief in Christ, Trinity, Scripture) and practical differences (authority structures, sacraments, pilgrimage sites such as Lourdes and St Peter’s Basilica).

## Exam technique

In exam responses aim for clarity and structure. Begin by defining key terms, then explain main beliefs with supporting examples or brief scriptural references. When asked to explain, focus on cause and consequence: why a belief matters and how it shapes practice. When asked to compare or evaluate, present different viewpoints fairly and end with a justified judgement that weighs the strengths and weaknesses of the positions you have discussed. Use specific examples from worship, scripture and Christian organisations to illustrate points, and when relevant identify differences between denominations (for instance, infant baptism versus believers’ baptism, or Catholic teaching versus Protestant interpretations). Keep answers balanced: show knowledge of belief and practice, apply that knowledge to moral or contemporary issues, and analyse implications where required by the question. Practise timing so you can allocate time to explain, apply and evaluate according to the mark scheme.
