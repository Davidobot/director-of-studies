# Non-religious perspectives (Humanism) (GCSE Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## What is Humanism?
Humanism is a non-religious life stance that centres human beings, reason and evidence as the best ways of understanding the world and deciding how to live. Humanists do not rely on supernatural explanations; instead they use scientific methods, critical thinking and ethical reflection. Within the non-religious category there are different positions: atheists who deny the existence of gods, agnostics who suspend judgement about the existence of gods, and humanists who go further by developing a positive ethical outlook that affirms human dignity, autonomy and social responsibility. Secular humanism emphasises the separation of religious institutions and the state and argues that public policy should be based on shared, rational principles rather than on religious authority. This mixture of commitment to evidence, human welfare and individual freedom is the distinctive feature that teachers should stress when explaining non-religious perspectives in comparison with religious worldviews.

## Meaning, identity and belonging
Humanists recognise that life has no single agreed spiritual purpose, yet many find deep meaning in family, relationships, work, creativity, social causes and engagement with the natural world. Where religious traditions offer identity through rituals, sacred stories and communal worship, humanists often find belonging through secular organisations, voluntary groups, charities and philosophical societies. Humanist communities provide alternatives to religious rites of passage: naming ceremonies, humanist weddings and memorial services are designed to mark life events with dignity and personal meaning without religious reference. In class, it is helpful to give concrete examples of humanist organisations that run celebrant services and community activities, because these show that non-religious people both seek and create belonging in ways that are parallel to religious practice.

## Life, death and funeral practices
A core non-religious belief is that death marks the end of personal consciousness; there is generally no belief in an immortal soul or an afterlife. For humanists this makes present-life values and relationships especially important: ethical choices and responsibilities are grounded in the finite nature of life. Mourning and funeral practices among non-religious people tend to be flexible and personalised. Humanist funerals are usually celebratory of the deceased’s life rather than focused on eschatological promises. Celebrants may lead reflections, readings, music and eulogies that honour the person’s character and relationships; families often choose music and readings that were significant to the person rather than religious texts. From a teaching perspective, emphasise that the absence of a fixed ritual does not mean an absence of ritual function: humanist ceremonies fulfil communal needs for grief, remembrance and meaning.

## Morality and how non-religious people decide right from wrong
Humanists derive moral guidance from reason, empathy, human experience and concern for welfare rather than from revealed authority or scripture. Ethical approaches common among non-religious thinkers include consequentialism (judging actions by their outcomes), appeals to human rights, and forms of virtue ethics that emphasise character and flourishing. Conscience and sympathy are important: humanists often argue that moral insight grows through education, dialogue and critical reflection. In teaching, it is useful to show how these methods work in practice. For example, when discussing animal rights, a humanist might appeal to scientific evidence of animal sentience and to ethical arguments about minimizing suffering, rather than to a sacred status conferred by scripture. Similarly, when considering stewardship of the environment, humanists typically combine scientific climate evidence with a moral argument about protecting vulnerable people and preserving biodiversity for future generations.

## Non-religious perspectives on medical ethics: abortion and euthanasia
Medical ethics is a key area where non-religious perspectives are often centred in GCSE Religious Studies. On abortion, humanists generally prioritise personal autonomy and bodily integrity, arguing that a pregnant person’s right to decide must be respected, especially early in pregnancy. There are, however, differences within non-religious views: some adopt a gradualist approach to personhood, claiming moral status increases as a foetus develops, while others place emphasis on social context and the consequences for the individuals involved. On euthanasia, many humanists support legal provision for assisted dying where safeguards protect autonomy and prevent abuse. The core arguments focus on compassion, respect for individual choice and the relief of unbearable suffering. In class debates, students should be encouraged to balance considerations of autonomy, the protection of vulnerable people, medical evidence about prognosis and palliative care, and legal safeguards that a democratic society might require.

## Freedom, law, wealth and human rights from a non-religious viewpoint
Humanists generally support freedom of belief and expression while promoting the neutrality of the state toward religion. This means public spaces and institutions should not privilege religious symbols or laws over secular ones. Non-religious perspectives often champion human rights as the basis for civic life, arguing that laws should protect individuals irrespective of faith. When it comes to wealth, humanists typically view personal wealth as a means to promote well-being rather than as an end in itself. Charity, progressive taxation and social policies that reduce inequality are commonly supported because they help societies function justly and humanely. Humanists will therefore often endorse public policies driven by evidence about what reduces harm and increases flourishing, and they will support organisations that translate these values into action—charities working on climate justice, refugees, or poverty relief provide clear examples of this practical ethic.

## Similarities and differences with religious perspectives
It is important to recognise both the overlap and the contrasts between humanist and religious worldviews. There is significant agreement on many moral aims: compassion, justice, care for the vulnerable, and concern for the environment are shared values across humanist and many religious traditions. Both religious and non-religious people commonly support charitable work and community service. The primary differences lie in sources of authority and explanations for existence. Religious believers typically ground morality and purpose in divine commands, sacred texts or spiritual doctrines, and often hold beliefs about the soul and an afterlife. Humanists, by contrast, ground ethics in human experience, reason and empirical evidence, and they tend to conclude that life’s meaning is constructed rather than revealed. For students, a useful classroom exercise is to map a specific issue—such as animal testing, climate action or assisted dying—showing where religious and humanist arguments converge and where they diverge, and why those differences matter for policy and personal decision-making.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about non-religious perspectives, begin by defining key terms: explain what is meant by humanism, secularism, atheist or agnostic as relevant. For short-answer AO1 questions, give clear, concise definitions and a brief example such as humanist funerals or Humanists UK. For AO2 application questions, connect the non-religious viewpoint to the scenario in the question: explain how a humanist would interpret the facts and what actions they might recommend. For AO3 evaluation and judgement questions, structure your answer so that you first outline the humanist position, then present contrasting religious views (for this specification, candidates should be prepared to compare non-religious perspectives with Christian or Catholic Christian beliefs), and finally weigh strengths and weaknesses. Use balanced language: acknowledge valid concerns on both sides, such as safeguarding vulnerable people in debates about assisted dying, and then justify your conclusion with reasoned argument. Where the assessment requires use of sources or ethical theory, refer to appropriate secular principles—human rights, autonomy, consequentialist reasoning—or to named organisations and practices as evidence of lived experience. Time management is crucial: spend the first few minutes planning a brief outline for longer answers, and aim to include an evaluative sentence in every paragraph for AO3 work. Always finish with a clear conclusion that answers the question directly; examiners look for a reasoned judgement, not simply a summary. Finally, practise writing model answers under timed conditions and use past question styles to build confidence in applying non-religious perspectives alongside the religious viewpoints specified in the syllabus.
