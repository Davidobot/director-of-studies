# Medical ethics: abortion and euthanasia (GCSE Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

Medical ethics raises some of the most personal and contested questions in Religious Studies: when does human life begin, who has the right to decide when life should end, and how should societies balance compassion with moral standards? Abortion and euthanasia are connected issues because both involve deliberate decisions about life and death. To understand how religious and non-religious perspectives respond, it helps to learn key ethical concepts, to see how different faith traditions apply their teachings, and to practise evaluating real-life scenarios. This guide summarises the main ideas you need for GCSE Religious Studies and helps you prepare for exam questions that ask you to describe beliefs, apply them to situations and make reasoned judgements.

## Key concepts and ethical principles

At the heart of debates about abortion and euthanasia are several ethical principles that appear again and again. The sanctity of life is a religious idea that human life is sacred because it is created by God or contains a divine element; it often leads to a strong presumption against deliberately ending life. Quality of life is a competing concern: some argue that life reduced to suffering or without meaningful awareness can justify ending or refusing treatment. Personhood asks when an entity (for example, an embryo or foetus) acquires the status of a moral person with rights. Autonomy stresses an individual’s right to make decisions about their own body and life. Beneficence and non-maleficence are medical ethics principles meaning to do good and not to harm. The Doctrine of Double Effect is a moral principle used in some religious traditions to permit actions that have a harmful side-effect (such as pain relief that may shorten life) if the intention is to relieve suffering and not to cause death. Understanding these concepts gives you tools to explain and evaluate different responses.

## Christian and Catholic perspectives

Many Christians begin with the idea that human beings are made in the image of God, which underpins the belief in the inherent worth of every human life. For many, this leads to the view that life begins at conception and must be protected. Biblical texts commonly used include the commandment “You shall not kill” and Psalm passages that speak of God forming life in the womb. Because of this, many Christians and most Catholics oppose abortion and active euthanasia. Catholic teaching is especially clear: the Catechism and papal encyclicals describe abortion and euthanasia as grave moral wrongs, although Catholic moral theology recognises complex situations, such as when treatment intended to cure or relieve may have the unintended effect of hastening death. The Doctrine of Double Effect is invoked in such cases to allow legitimate medical actions when the aim is not to kill. Within Christianity there is some diversity: a minority of Christians accept abortion in certain extreme circumstances, and some may accept passive euthanasia (withdrawing treatment) when interventions are futile. Christians who emphasise compassion and the alleviation of suffering may support palliative care and oppose active measures to end life.

## Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh perspectives

Buddhism does not begin with a single creator God, so its reasoning is centred on karma, intention and compassion. The first precept—avoiding taking life—points against abortion and euthanasia, yet Buddhists also weigh complex factors such as intention and consequences. A compassionate intention that seeks to reduce suffering may be seen as mitigating moral guilt, even if the act remains unskilful. Buddhists are particularly sensitive to the state of mind at death, because a disturbed mind at the moment of death can affect future rebirth. Hindu teaching emphasises ahimsa, non-violence, and holds that all living beings possess an atman (soul). Many Hindus view life as continuous through samsara (the cycle of rebirth), which influences attitudes toward abortion and euthanasia: causing death can create negative karma, but dharma (duty) and contextual considerations may allow differing responses, especially where saving a life or preventing suffering is at stake. Sikhism values the atma (soul) and stresses hukam (divine will) and compassion. Sikhs generally regard life as sacred and favour palliative care, though there can be compassionate allowances in complex situations; intention and the duty of seva (selfless service) feature in decision-making.

## Islamic and Jewish perspectives

Islamic ethics place a strong emphasis on the sanctity of life and on God as the giver and taker of life. Teachings from the Qur’an and Hadith lead many Muslims to oppose euthanasia. Abortion is treated with nuance: many Muslim scholars permit abortion to save the mother’s life and some accept termination in early pregnancy under certain conditions; views about the point of ensoulment (a moment when the foetus is believed to receive a soul) vary, with a common position placing ensoulment around 120 days but other interpretations applying different thresholds. In Judaism the concept of pikuach nefesh, saving a life, is central and can outweigh many other religious laws. Classical Jewish law tends to consider the foetus as part of the mother’s body until birth, which explains why abortion can be permitted to save the mother’s life or health. Active euthanasia is generally forbidden in Jewish law, though passive measures and intensive palliative care are accepted and the emphasis is on relieving suffering and preserving life when possible. Orthodox and Reform communities may differ in emphasis, with Reform Judaism often placing greater weight on individual autonomy.

## Non-religious perspectives and legal context

Humanist and secular viewpoints tend to ground decisions in autonomy, human rights and utilitarian considerations of harm and benefit. Many non-religious people argue that a woman’s right to choose and a competent patient’s right to decide about their own life are decisive reasons to allow abortion and assisted dying within strict legal safeguards. Others worry about societal consequences and the need to protect vulnerable people. In the UK legal context, abortion is permitted under conditions set out in statute up to a legal limit in most cases, with tighter restrictions beyond that and exceptions when the mother’s life is at risk or severe foetal abnormality is present. Assisted suicide and active euthanasia remain illegal in the UK, though the subject is the focus of ongoing public and political debate. Many countries elsewhere have legalised voluntary assisted dying under controlled conditions; comparing these laws helps students see how ethical principles translate into law and clinical practice. Throughout, the important role of palliative care and hospice services is widely recognised: relief of suffering, dignity in dying, and support for families are priorities across religious and non-religious traditions.

## Applying beliefs to scenarios and evaluating arguments

When you apply religious teachings to particular cases you should show how core beliefs lead to particular moral choices while recognising diversity within traditions. For example, in a case where a pregnant woman’s life is threatened, Catholic teaching may permit medical interventions that unintentionally cause foetal death if the intention is to save the mother, because of the Doctrine of Double Effect. A Buddhist approach would focus on intention, compassion and the likely karmic consequences, while a humanist would emphasise the woman’s autonomy and welfare. When evaluating arguments about euthanasia, contrast sanctity of life arguments with appeals to autonomy, the relief of suffering, and the quality of life. Consider slippery slope worries about abuse, and balance these against safeguards proposed by advocates. Use reasoned evaluation: identify strengths and weaknesses in each position, use examples and, where appropriate, refer to real-world laws or statistics to make your case more concrete. Avoid simple assertions; explain why a belief leads to a certain conclusion and whether that conclusion holds up in practice.

## Classroom and revision tips

To prepare for questions on abortion and euthanasia, practise writing short definitions of key terms such as sanctity of life, personhood, autonomy, palliative care and the Doctrine of Double Effect. Create comparison paragraphs that set two perspectives against each other — for example, Catholic teaching versus a humanist view on euthanasia — and practise reaching a balanced judgement. Use contemporary cases sensitively to illustrate arguments: for instance, consider the ethical differences between withdrawing life-sustaining treatment and actively administering a lethal dose. Remember to include examples of religious texts or teachings to support answers where relevant, but avoid relying solely on quotations. Discuss the moral complexity and show awareness that followers within each tradition may disagree. Practise past-style exam questions under timed conditions and get feedback on whether you explained the application of beliefs clearly and evaluated different viewpoints.

## Exam technique

Answer questions with a clear structure: begin by defining key terms, then explain beliefs or ethical principles (AO1). Next apply those beliefs to the scenario or question (AO2) and finish with analysis and evaluation (AO3) that shows understanding of strengths and weaknesses and reaches a reasoned conclusion. For short questions, be concise and precise: give a clear definition or one focused example. For medium-length questions, explain two or three points and include a brief example or quote. For longer essay-style questions, write balanced paragraphs that present a view, support it with reasons or religious teaching, offer a contrasting view, evaluate both, and end with a justified conclusion. Always use subject-specific vocabulary, name relevant teachings or scriptures where appropriate, and show awareness of diversity within traditions. Time-manage by allocating minutes per mark and leave a few minutes to proofread and add a short concluding judgement. Examiners reward clarity, balance, and the ability to link belief to practice and real-life situations, so aim for thoughtful analysis and a clear, supported conclusion.
