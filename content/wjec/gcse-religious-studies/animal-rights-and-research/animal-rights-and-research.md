# Animal rights and use in research (GCSE Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## Why animal rights and research matter in Religious Studies
The question of whether animals have rights and when, if ever, it is acceptable to use them in scientific or medical research sits at the intersection of ethics, religion and science. This topic asks you to think about moral status, compassion, duty and the consequences of our actions. It raises practical questions—should we test new medicines on animals?—and deeper philosophical ones—are animals merely resources for human benefit or do they have value in their own right? In the GCSE course this theme appears under “Roles, rights and responsibilities” and is assessed by asking you to explain beliefs and teachings from religious and non-religious perspectives, apply them to situations, and evaluate arguments for and against animal use in research. To answer such questions well you will need to combine knowledge of teachings with ethical reasoning and awareness of legal and scientific safeguards.

## Christian and Catholic perspectives
Christian responses to animal welfare are shaped by Genesis and later Christian teaching. Genesis 1:26–28 says humans were made in God’s image and given “dominion” over animals, language that has been interpreted in different ways. Some Christians have taken dominion to mean broad human control and use of animals for human needs. Others read the same passages through the idea of stewardship: because God created the world, humans are trustees who must care for creation responsibly and compassionately. Proverbs 12:10, which praises “a righteous man who cares for the needs of his animals”, is often used to support the duty to minimise animal suffering.

When it comes to research, many Christian denominations accept the use of animals for serious medical purposes that protect or save human life, provided suffering is minimised and alternatives are sought. Catholic teaching adds emphasis on human dignity and moral responsibility. Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si’ stresses care for creation and calls for a respectful relationship with non-human life. Catholic thought generally allows animal research when it is necessary for human health and when strict ethical safeguards are followed; the Catechism and papal writings encourage minimising harm and investing in alternatives. Within Christianity there are also movements and individuals—vegetarians, vegans and organisations such as Christian Vegetarians & Vegans UK—who argue that compassion and stewardship point towards reducing or eliminating animal use in research.

## Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh perspectives
Eastern religious teachings approach animal ethics through ideas of non-harm, karma and the interconnection of life. In Buddhism the First Precept (to refrain from taking life) and the teaching of ahimsa (non‑violence) encourage compassion to all sentient beings. Karma and the cycle of samsara mean that animals are part of the moral web: harmful actions accumulate negative consequences. Many Buddhists therefore argue for avoiding unnecessary harm to animals and support the development of alternatives to animal testing. However, historical texts show that the Buddha himself did not demand universal vegetarianism, so Buddhist responses can vary; some Buddhists may accept animal research in rare, carefully justified cases, especially when the aim is to prevent large-scale human suffering.

Hindu ethics places ahimsa and reverence for life at its centre. The belief that every living being contains an atman (soul) and the value of non-violence lead many Hindus to favour reduced use of animals and to support vegetarianism. Sacred regard for certain animals—most famously the cow—also shapes attitudes towards causing harm. Nevertheless, Hindu opinion is not monolithic; decisions about research are often evaluated in terms of dharma (duty) and the consequences for karma, so some Hindus might accept research if it is in accordance with ethical duty and if alternatives are not available.

Sikh teaching stresses the divine spark in all beings and the importance of compassion (daya) and selfless service (seva). While Sikhs tend to prioritise human life, there is a strong moral case within Sikhism for treating animals kindly and for opposing unnecessary suffering. Langar (community kitchens) and the tradition of offering vegetarian food in many gurdwaras reflect a concern to avoid harm. In practice, Sikhs are likely to demand strict justification and humane treatment if animals are used in experiments.

## Islamic and Jewish perspectives
Within Islam and Judaism there are clear theological principles that guide views on animal welfare. Islam teaches stewardship (khalifah) and the concept of balance (mizan) in creation; the Qur’an and Hadith emphasise mercy towards animals and forbid cruelty. The Prophet Muhammad’s reported kindness to animals and teaching that those who are merciful will be rewarded are used to support humane treatment. Most Muslim scholars accept animal research when it is necessary to protect human life and when it is conducted in the least harmful way possible, though views differ about borderline cases. Halal slaughter rules and broader dietary laws reflect a concern to limit suffering, and this principle carries over to ethical expectations about research.

Judaism includes the principle of tza’ar ba’alei chayim (preventing animal suffering), which places a religious obligation on people to avoid cruelty. Jewish law has historically permitted the use of animals for food and other benefits, but it insists on humane methods (for example, the laws of shechita for slaughter). In medical contexts, Jewish ethics often prioritises pikuach nefesh (saving human life), which can justify animal research aimed at preventing or treating disease, provided the suffering is justified and minimal and alternatives are considered. As with other traditions, responses are not uniform and involve detailed moral reasoning.

## Non‑religious and secular perspectives, science and regulation
Secular ethical approaches bring their own arguments. Utilitarian reasoning—assessing actions by their outcomes—has been used to justify animal research when it produces greater overall benefit (for example, life‑saving vaccines), while also supporting strict welfare standards to reduce suffering. Rights‑based and anti‑speciesist positions challenge the idea that humans may use animals as mere means and call for stronger protections or abolition of animal experimentation. Humanist views often support rigorous scientific research that advances human well‑being but insist on ethical constraints, respect for sentience and investment in alternatives.

Practical safeguards and legal frameworks are central to modern debate. In the UK the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022 recognises animals as sentient and commits to considering their welfare in government decisions. Scientific and ethical frameworks, such as the “3Rs” (Replace, Reduce, Refine), guide responsible research: Replace animals with alternatives where possible, Reduce the number of animals used, and Refine procedures to minimise suffering. The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (and its contemporary regulatory environment) requires licensing, ethical review, and justification for procedures. Advances in alternatives—cell cultures, organoids, computer modelling and “organ‑on‑chip” technologies—are increasingly important in reducing reliance on animal testing. Debates sometimes use historical examples, such as the harm caused by thalidomide despite some animal testing, to show that animal experiments are not infallible and that better methods and regulation are needed.

## Arguments for and against the use of animals in research
When evaluating the ethics of animal research you should weigh both sides. Supporters argue that animal experiments have led to vaccines, medicines and surgical techniques that save human lives, and that when strict regulations and welfare measures are in place, the benefits can justify limited, well‑regulated use. Critics counter that animals are sentient beings capable of suffering, so using them instrumentally is morally wrong; they point to speciesism—the unjustified privileging of human interests—and argue for stronger protections or complete replacement of animal testing. Middle positions emphasise precaution: allow research only when no viable alternatives exist, require independent ethical review, accept only studies with clear and significant human benefit, and demand the highest welfare standards. In religious terms, many traditions accept a principle of proportionality—harm may be permitted only when it serves an important good and when harms are minimised.

## Teaching and classroom examples
To make this topic engaging, use concrete case studies that link beliefs to real decisions. Discuss vaccine development and the ethical debates when animal models are used, or explore the ban on cosmetic testing on animals in the UK and EU as an example of legal change reflecting ethical concerns. Ask students to compare Genesis 1:26–28 and Proverbs 12:10 with the Buddhist First Precept and Hindu teachings on ahimsa to see how different scriptures lead to similar moral emphases. Encourage research into organisations named in the specification—such as A Rocha, Karuna Trust, Catholic Concern for Animals, Dharma Voices for Animals and PETA—to see how beliefs motivate practical action. When preparing for assessments, remind students to use religious texts and teachings to explain a viewpoint, apply those teachings to the issue, and evaluate the strength of the argument while considering alternatives and consequences.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on animal rights and use in research, clearly structure your response and show balance. For “describe” or AO1 questions begin with accurate, concise statements of beliefs and include scriptural or authoritative references where appropriate. For “apply” or AO2 questions explain how those beliefs would guide behaviour in a given scenario—how would a Christian, a Buddhist or a humanist respond to a proposed animal experiment? For evaluative AO3 questions present arguments for and against, weigh their strengths and weaknesses, and reach a reasoned judgement. Use a clear paragraph structure: start with a point, develop it with teaching or evidence, apply it to the ethical issue, and then evaluate. Avoid one-sided answers; show that you understand complexity by acknowledging exceptions, different interpretations within traditions and practical constraints such as legal regulations and scientific necessity. Always conclude with a short summary that gives your informed judgement, and where possible link back to key concepts like stewardship, sanctity of life, ahimsa, sentience and the 3Rs. Manage your time so you leave a few minutes to check your use of sources and to ensure your final paragraph clearly states your reasoned conclusion.
