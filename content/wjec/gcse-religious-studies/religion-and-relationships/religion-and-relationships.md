# Religion and relationships (marriage, family, sex) (GCSE Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of the topic and assessment focus
This topic asks you to explore how religious and non-religious worldviews shape attitudes to marriage, family life and sexual ethics, and to show that you can use evidence to reach considered judgements. In the WJEC non‑examination assessment for Unit 2 you will respond to a set theme chosen from a list provided each year (for example marriage, contraception, cohabitation, same‑sex relationships, interfaith marriage, gender roles, or religious upbringing). You will need to study the two traditions you have followed throughout the course (Christianity or Catholic Christianity, and one world religion) alongside non‑religious perspectives, and you will be assessed on your ability to select appropriate sources, use them to support analysis and evaluation, and to reflect on your own values. This section of the specification therefore combines doctrinal knowledge with evaluation, contemporary context and personal reflection.

## How beliefs and teachings shape relationships
Religions provide teachings about the nature and purpose of human relationships that shape behaviour, ceremonies and community practice. In Christianity marriage is often spoken of as a covenant and, in many traditions, as a sacrament that reflects the union between Christ and the Church; teachings about love (agape) and the Ten Commandments influence expectations about fidelity and care within the family. Catholic teaching places strong emphasis on the sanctity of life and the indissolubility of marriage, leading to particular positions on contraception, divorce and remarriage, and the use of Church procedures such as annulment. In many strands of Islam, marriage is a contractual and sacred relationship with clear rights and responsibilities for spouses; sexual relations are morally appropriate within marriage and various legal and ethical rules about divorce, inheritance and family life are derived from scripture and juristic interpretation. Hindu perspectives tend to stress duty (dharma), family obligations and the importance of ritual and social order; marriage is a central rite of passage with strong community significance. Buddhism focuses on ethical conduct and intention, with sexual ethics taught through precepts and the ideal of reducing suffering; attitudes vary widely by culture and tradition. Sikh teachings strongly emphasise equality, community service and family responsibility while celebrating marriage as the life‑long union of equals. Non‑religious perspectives, such as humanism, ground decisions in autonomy, consent and the well‑being of those involved, and often prioritise individual choice and rights over prescriptive religious rules.

## Marriage, divorce, remarriage and civil partnerships
The place of marriage in religious life can be both theological and social, and different traditions respond in different ways to the realities of modern family life. For many Christians marriage is a lifelong commitment; some denominations allow divorce and welcome remarriage while others, especially the Catholic Church, regard marriage as indissoluble but provide pastoral and canonical ways to address failed unions such as annulment. Jewish law recognises marriage as a binding contract and provides procedures for divorce; interpretations vary between Orthodox, Conservative and Reform communities. In Islam divorce is permitted though regulated, and conversations about fairness and gendered power are central to how divorce is handled in different cultural settings. The law in the UK recognises civil marriage and civil partnerships for same‑sex couples, which has changed the social context in which religious teaching is discussed; some religious communities have adapted their practice, others have held to traditional teachings and some distinguish between civil and religious rites. When you study this area, focus on how sacred texts, historical interpretation and pastoral concerns produce different responses to divorce and remarriage, and how national law interacts with religious practice — for example how civil law provides rights and protections that affect cohabiting couples, parental responsibility and property, while religious communities continue to offer their own rites and moral guidance.

## Sex before and outside marriage, cohabitation and contraception
Sexual ethics is a central and sometimes contested part of religious teaching about relationships. Many faiths teach that sexual activity has a moral dimension because it affects relationships, responsibilities and the creation of life. Traditional Christian and Islamic teachings have emphasised chastity outside marriage and sexual fidelity within it, though interpretations and pastoral responses vary by denomination and culture. Catholic doctrine uniquely rejects artificial contraception and recommends natural family planning, linking sexual acts to procreation and the moral law. Other Christian denominations are generally more accepting of contraception as a responsible way to plan family life. In Islam contraception is often seen as permissible when both spouses consent and no harm results, and in Hindu and Buddhist contexts attitudes are diverse and often guided by principles such as non‑harm, duty and wisdom. Cohabitation and sex before marriage are increasingly common in contemporary society, and many religious communities now engage with these realities by focusing on pastoral care, ethics of responsibility and the quality of the relationship rather than only on formal status. When studying these issues, use case studies to examine how doctrine, lived practice and social change interact, and pay attention to distinctions between official teachings, local practice and personal belief.

## Roles within the family, gender and religious upbringing
Religious traditions teach about roles in the family in ways that reflect theology, ethics and historical context. Some texts and traditions have been interpreted to support distinct gender roles, for example emphasising husband as provider and wife as carer; other readings emphasise mutual respect, shared responsibility and equality. Movements within many faiths have produced alternative readings that support gender equality and women’s leadership, and some traditions, such as Sikhism, include strong theological claims about equality that have often been used to argue for equal rights within marriage and community. The expectations placed on parents about raising children in the faith, the significance of rites of passage such as baptism, naming ceremonies or initiation, and the role of faith schools are also central to this topic. Interfaith marriages raise further questions about identity, compromise and continuity: how do couples negotiate different practices, how are children raised, and how do communities respond? You should be ready to compare similarities and differences both within and between traditions and to consider the role of social change, equality legislation and pluralism in reshaping family roles.

## Sources, evidence and approaching the NEA
For the non‑examination assessment you will need to select sources that illuminate the chosen theme from the perspectives you have studied. Good sources include sacred texts (quotations that exemplify a teaching), official statements from religious bodies (synod outcomes, papal encyclicals, fatwas or denominational guidance), interviews or testimonies showing lived experience, contemporary media coverage that demonstrates public debate, and the aims and work of charities or agencies that act on faith‑inspired principles. When you select sources explain why each is useful: does it provide doctrinal authority, illustrate lived practice, demonstrate diversity of opinion, or highlight legal impact? Assess reliability by considering authorship, purpose and context; a local community leader’s view is valuable as lived evidence but differs in authority from an official doctrinal text. Use your sources to analyse and evaluate viewpoints: unpack the reasons behind a teaching, consider strengths and weaknesses, and weigh the relevance of scripture against changing social contexts and law. Remember that WJEC values reasoned judgements and reflective personal responses, so your submission should move beyond description to balanced argument and clear reflection on your own values in relation to the theme.

## Exam technique
When answering questions or preparing your NEA, aim for clarity, balance and evidence. Start each paragraph with a clear point, follow with evidence from a religious or non‑religious source and explain how that evidence supports the point, before evaluating its significance or limitations. For AO1 make sure you accurately describe beliefs and practices; for AO2 apply those beliefs to real situations or case studies; for AO3 analyse and evaluate by comparing viewpoints, considering implications and reaching a justified conclusion. Use specific language: refer to doctrines (for example sanctity of life, agape, dharma), name texts or authorities where appropriate, and explain differences between official teaching and lived religion. When evaluating, consider context, counter‑arguments and practical consequences, and avoid over‑generalising about entire faith communities. For the NEA, choose sources that give a range of perspectives and explicitly justify your selection, show critical engagement by questioning reliability and bias, and reflect honestly on your own position: explain how your conclusion is informed by evidence and why you accept or reject particular arguments. Time management matters in exams; allocate time to plan, write and check your answers, and in the NEA plan drafts, seek feedback and ensure your final submission follows the guidance on word limits and referencing. Above all, aim to show informed understanding, careful application and fair evaluation — the skills that examiners look for when assessing religion and relationships.
