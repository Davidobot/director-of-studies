# Islam beliefs and practices (GCSE Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview
Islam is a monotheistic faith practised by over a billion people worldwide. At its heart is the belief in one God, Allah, and in a line of prophets who communicated God’s guidance to humanity. Islam shapes personal worship, community life and moral decision-making through a combination of creed, scripture and practice. For GCSE study you will need to understand core beliefs (such as tawhid and prophethood), the role of the Qur’an and Hadith, the Five Pillars as central acts of worship, beliefs about life after death, and how Islamic ethics and law influence contemporary issues. It is essential to separate religious teaching from local custom: Muslims in different countries may practise and interpret teachings in varied ways, but the central principles remain the same.

## Allah and core beliefs
Tawhid, the oneness of God, is the foundational doctrine of Islam. Allah is unique, transcendent and beyond complete human comprehension, while also close to creation. Muslims describe many attributes of Allah—merciful, compassionate, omnipotent, just—and the tradition of the ninety-nine names summarises these qualities in different ways. Related to tawhid is the prohibition of shirk: associating partners with God is considered the most serious violation of Islamic belief. Muslims understand human beings as created by Allah and given responsibilities on earth; humanity’s natural disposition (fitrah) inclines people towards recognising God. The idea of a soul, moral responsibility, free will within divine knowledge, and accountability before God are all important. Beliefs about predestination (al‑qadr) vary in emphasis between different Muslim traditions, but most accept that God’s knowledge and power coexist with human ethical responsibility.

## Prophethood, scripture and authority
Muslims believe God has guided humanity through prophets and revealed scripture across history. Prophets such as Adam, Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus) are honoured for bringing God’s message, and Muhammad is understood as the Seal of the Prophets, the final messenger through whom the Qur’an was revealed by Angel Jibril. The Qur’an is central: it is regarded as the literal word of God in Arabic, a source of guidance for belief, worship and conduct. The Hadith literature—reports of the Prophet Muhammad’s words and actions—helps explain and apply the Qur’an and is used as a source of law and moral teaching. Islamic authority is therefore a combination of scripture, prophetic example, and scholarly interpretation; different schools of thought and jurisprudence interpret texts in diverse ways, creating a range of practices and legal opinions across the Muslim world.

## The Five Pillars and worship
The Five Pillars provide the framework for Muslim worship and practical devotion. The Shahadah, the testimony that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger, is the declaration of faith that makes one a Muslim. Salah, the five daily prayers, structures the day and includes ritual purification, specific physical movements and recitation directed toward Makkah. Zakah is an obligatory alms tax intended to redistribute wealth and support the needy, while sadaqah refers to voluntary charity. Sawm, fasting during the month of Ramadan, trains self-discipline and empathy for the poor; it culminates in the festival of Eid al-Fitr. Hajj, the pilgrimage to Makkah, is required once in a lifetime for those who are able and includes rites such as tawaf (circumambulation of the Kaaba), standing at Arafat and acts of sacrifice during Eid al-Adha. Islamic worship combines individual devotion and communal acts; Friday congregational prayer (Jummah) exemplifies how worship also builds the community.

## Life, death and the afterlife
Islamic beliefs about life and death emphasise preparation for the Day of Judgement (Akhirah). The soul is created by God and enters human life; after death the soul passes into an intermediate state (often called Barzakh) until resurrection. On the Day of Judgement every person will be held accountable for their deeds and intentions, and will be sent to Paradise (Jannah) or Hell (Jahannam) according to God’s justice and mercy. Rituals at death, such as washing the body (ghusl), shrouding (kafan), the funeral prayer (Salat al‑Janazah) and burial facing Makkah, express beliefs in the sanctity of life, community responsibility and the hope of divine mercy. Issues such as beliefs about when life begins, the ethics of abortion and euthanasia, and views on medical intervention are debated within Islam using principles from scripture, prophetic example and jurisprudential reasoning; different scholars and communities may reach different conclusions depending on context and interpretation.

## Ethics, law and contemporary practice
Islamic ethics flows from scripture and prophetic teaching and is applied through Sharia, a system of moral and legal guidance developed by scholars. Primary sources are the Qur’an and the Sunnah (the Prophet’s practice); secondary methods include consensus, analogy and reasoning to address new issues. Concepts such as halal (permissible) and haram (forbidden) structure daily life, influencing diet, financial practice (prohibition of riba, or interest, in many interpretations), family law and business conduct. The idea of the Ummah—the global Muslim community—encourages solidarity, mutual support and social justice, which is expressed in institutions such as zakah and in the work of Muslim charities. Contemporary topics that often feature in exams include environmental stewardship, animal welfare and halal slaughter, the role of sharia in plural societies, and how Muslims balance tradition with living as citizens in non‑Muslim countries. It is useful to remember the diversity of opinion within Islam, and that cultural practices should not automatically be taken as universal religious requirements.

## Identity, community and diversity
Muslim identity is expressed through ritual, dress and community life, but it is not monolithic. Symbols of identity such as the hijab, niqab or other forms of modest dress carry religious significance for many, yet practices differ by culture, gender and personal conviction. Dietary rules (halal) and communal institutions like the mosque, madrasa, and family networks create a sense of belonging. Pilgrimage to Makkah powerfully reinforces a collective identity that transcends ethnicity and nation. At the same time Islam in modern Britain and Wales is plural: there are Sunni and Shia traditions, a range of theological schools, and different levels of observance. Engagement with public life, the negotiation of religious expression in schools and workplaces, and responses to issues such as Islamophobia, multiculturalism and religious freedom are important contemporary themes. Examples of practical faith in action include humanitarian work by organisations such as Islamic relief agencies, community initiatives run through mosques, and interfaith projects that build bridges in diverse societies.

## Exam technique
To do well in GCSE questions on Islam beliefs and practices, be precise about definitions, use evidence and show balance in evaluation. For AO1 answers clearly define key terms and describe beliefs or practices in a structured way. For AO2 apply beliefs to scenarios or explain how teachings influence actions, using specific examples such as the Five Pillars, Hajj rites or funeral practices. For AO3 include analysis and evaluation: weigh different viewpoints, consider strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and show awareness of diversity within Islam. In timed exams, read the question carefully and plan your answer, ensuring each paragraph has a clear point, development and example. Where asked to ‘evaluate’ give at least two perspectives and a reasoned conclusion that shows judgement. Use religious vocabulary accurately but explain it briefly where necessary. When comparing religious and non‑religious views, highlight similarities and differences and avoid overgeneralising. Finally, practise past questions, time yourself, and aim to write concise, supported answers that integrate belief, practice and contemporary relevance.
