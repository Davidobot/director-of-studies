# Stewardship and environmental ethics (GCSE Religious Studies WJEC / Eduqas)

## What stewardship and environmental ethics mean
Stewardship is a religious and ethical idea that describes humanity’s responsibility towards the natural world. At its heart is the claim that people do not simply own the earth as an unlimited resource: they have duties to protect, manage and sustain it for current and future generations. Environmental ethics is the wider philosophical field that asks why nature should matter morally, which things have intrinsic value, and how humans should act when economic, technological and environmental interests conflict. In Religious Studies you will meet stewardship as a theological principle, for example in the Judeo‑Christian idea that humans are given responsibility for creation (Genesis 1:26–28) and as practical concerns such as conserving biodiversity, reducing pollution and resisting wasteful use of resources. The idea of stewardship helps students link scripture and belief to real‑world problems like climate change, deforestation and loss of species.

## Christian and Catholic perspectives on caring for creation
Within Christianity there are two common ways to understand humanity’s relationship with nature: dominion and stewardship. The language of dominion in Genesis can be read in a controlling or an accountable way; many Christians argue that dominion implies responsibility and care rather than licence to exploit. The Bible is used to support both positions: passages such as Psalm 8 celebrate humanity’s place in creation, while Leviticus and other texts contain practical rules about managing land and rest for the earth. Catholic teaching has developed particular emphasis on these responsibilities. Modern papal teaching, most clearly in Pope Francis’s encyclical Laudato Si’, frames environmental care as a moral obligation linked to human dignity and social justice. Laudato Si’ connects ecological damage with poverty, calling for global solidarity and a conversion of lifestyle. Christian responses range from churches promoting community gardens and conservation projects to campaigns for climate justice and sustainable living. Organisations inspired by Christian stewardship, such as A Rocha, focus on conservation rooted in Christian belief, showing how theology can motivate practical environmental action.

## Stewardship across world religions
Religious traditions other than Christianity provide different resources for environmental ethics while often converging on similar outcomes. Buddhism stresses interdependence through the teaching of Dependent Origination and promotes compassion (karuna) and non‑harm (ahimsa) towards all living beings. This leads many Buddhists to support ecological protection and mindful consumption. Hinduism locates humans within an all‑pervading divine reality (Brahman) and teaches that harming nature can produce bad karma; concepts such as dharma (duty) and ahimsa encourage reverence for the natural world and sometimes inspire vegetarianism and conservation. In Islam the idea of humans as khalifah (stewards) on earth and the concept of mizan (balance) underpin environmental obligations; Islamic organisations like the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences draw on Qur’anic teachings about God’s creation and human accountability. Judaism offers resources such as bal tashchit (do not waste) and Tikkun Olam (repairing the world), which have been interpreted to demand sustainable practices and care for creation. Sikh teachings emphasise hukam (divine order) and Sarbat da Bhala (the welfare of all), encouraging respect for nature and a simple lifestyle. Across these faiths, religious language and ritual shape attitudes to the environment and motivate practical initiatives: pilgrimages to sacred sites, temple and mosque community projects, and faith‑based environmental networks adapting traditional teachings to contemporary ecological concerns.

## Non‑religious perspectives and secular environmental ethics
Non‑religious perspectives, including humanism and other secular ethical positions, approach environmental ethics through reason, science and concern for wellbeing. Humanists tend to emphasise our capacity to foresee consequences and act on evidence, arguing that protecting the environment promotes human flourishing and reduces suffering. Secular arguments often focus on concepts such as biodiversity’s instrumental value for food security and medicine, but they also embrace intrinsic value claims that species and ecosystems deserve moral consideration for their own sake. Philosophical positions like utilitarianism weigh environmental choices by their overall consequences, while rights‑based approaches extend certain protections to animals or ecosystems. Movements such as Deep Ecology challenge anthropocentrism by arguing that nature has intrinsic worth independent of human use. In practice, secular groups organise climate campaigns, support legislation to protect habitats and promote ethical consumption, complementing and sometimes differing from religious approaches on motivation and emphasis.

## Animal rights, sentience and scientific use
Debates about animal rights and the use of animals in science are central to environmental ethics. Many religious teachings stress humane treatment of animals: Proverbs, the concept of stewardship in Christianity, the Jewish idea of tza’ar ba’alei chayim, Hindu and Buddhist ahimsa, and Sikh daya (compassion) all discourage unnecessary cruelty. At the same time, texts and traditions provide room for the responsible use of animals for food, work and medical research. Modern ethical discussion focuses on sentience and suffering: if animals feel pain and possess interests, then causing avoidable suffering is morally problematic. The Animal Welfare Act 2022 in the UK recognises animal sentience and shapes public policy. When it comes to scientific research, positions vary: many accept animal experiments when they are necessary, tightly regulated and aim to reduce suffering, while others insist on alternatives where possible, advocating the Three Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) and technological replacements such as computer modelling or cell‑based methods. Religious and secular voices meet in arguing for humane standards, better oversight and efforts to develop alternatives that protect both human health and animal welfare.

## Ethical frameworks and tensions: dominion, stewardship, and justice
Stewardship does not resolve all ethical tensions; critical questions remain about when humans may use natural resources and how to prioritise interests. The contrast between dominion and stewardship illustrates different theological readings: dominion as licence can justify exploitation, while stewardship calls for restraint and care. Philosophically, debates revolve around whether nature has intrinsic value or only instrumental value for humans. Utilitarian calculations may justify environmental harm if it produces greater overall benefit, whereas rights‑based views and virtue ethics emphasise duty, character and respect. Environmental justice adds another layer: damage to the environment disproportionately affects the poor and marginalised, so ethical responses must combine ecological protection with concern for social inequality. Climate change presents a global moral problem because present actions have long‑term and geographically uneven effects; religious teachings about care for the neighbour and obligations to future generations can reinforce secular moral arguments for mitigation and adaptation.

## Practical responses: organisations, law and daily life
Religious and secular organisations play a vital role translating ethical ideas into practical action. Faith groups run conservation projects, community farms, and educational programmes; Catholic and Christian agencies have specific campaigns inspired by papal teaching and scripture, while Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish and Sikh groups mobilise community values in support of sustainability. Secular organisations, from Humanist Climate Action to major animal welfare charities, provide scientific expertise, lobbying and public education. Legal frameworks such as animal welfare laws, environmental regulations and planning policies set the political context in which ethical choices are made. At the everyday level, stewardship can be expressed through choices about diet, transport, energy use and consumer behaviour, as well as participation in acts of civic campaigning. Teaching and revision should connect beliefs and teachings to these concrete examples: a case study of a church running a solar project, a mosque organising tree planting, or a humanist campaigner lobbying for plastic reduction all show how ethical principles become lived practice.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on stewardship and environmental ethics, structure and clarity are essential. Start by demonstrating clear knowledge (AO1): define key terms such as stewardship, dominion, ahimsa or khalifah and refer briefly to relevant teachings or scripture to show understanding. Next, apply that knowledge to the question (AO2) by linking beliefs to the ethical issue at hand; for example, explain how Genesis 1:26–28 or Laudato Si’ would influence a Christian response to climate change. Use specific examples to show application: name an organisation, explain a policy or describe a practice. For evaluation (AO3) present balanced argument: acknowledge different interpretations within a religion, compare religious and non‑religious positions, and weigh strengths and weaknesses of each viewpoint. Consider opposing arguments and possible consequences, and avoid one‑sided answers. A useful approach is to use a short paragraph for definition, one or two paragraphs applying beliefs to the issue, and one paragraph evaluating before a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Always link your conclusion back to the stem of the question so examiners can see you have addressed the task. Remember the assessment objectives: aim to demonstrate accurate knowledge, show clear application, and deploy thoughtful analysis and evaluation. Where appropriate, include scriptural or doctrinal references and modern examples to support your points, and write clearly and precisely with well‑developed sentences rather than lists.
