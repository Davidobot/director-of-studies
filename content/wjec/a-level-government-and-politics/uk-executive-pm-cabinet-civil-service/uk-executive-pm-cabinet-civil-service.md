# The UK Executive: Prime Minister, Cabinet and Civil Service (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of the UK executive
The UK executive is the branch of government responsible for directing the business of the state: setting policy, making decisions on how laws will be implemented, running government departments and representing the country at home and abroad. At national level the executive is typically understood as the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Civil Service, working together (and sometimes against one another) within the constraints of the constitution, Parliament, the courts and public opinion. Because the British constitution is uncodified and flexible, the practical distribution of power within the executive has changed over time. Historically the Cabinet dominated collective decision-making; by the late twentieth century, scholars and commentators began to describe a shift towards stronger prime ministerial leadership. The reality is often mixed: the balance of power between Prime Minister, Cabinet and Civil Service varies with personalities, party strength, events (for example wars, economic crises or referendums) and institutional reforms.

## The Prime Minister: sources and limits of power
The Prime Minister is the head of government and the central political figure in the executive. Their authority derives from a number of sources: leadership of the largest party (or coalition) in the House of Commons, formal powers rooted in the royal prerogative exercised in the Prime Minister's name, control of ministerial appointments and therefore patronage, and the resources of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Cabinet Office. In practice the PM chairs Cabinet meetings, sets the government’s overall agenda, represents the UK internationally and often dominates public debate.

Despite these sources, prime ministerial power is not absolute. Parliamentary arithmetic constrains a Prime Minister who lacks a majority; strong backbenchers, party factions or coalition partners can limit action. Legal and institutional checks include judicial review and constitutional conventions, and political constraints come from the media and public opinion. Recent constitutional developments have sometimes altered these dynamics: the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (now repealed by later legislation) changed how and when general elections could be held, and Brexit placed extraordinary demands on the office because of the need to negotiate with the EU while managing a fractious parliamentary majority. Historical examples help to show the range of PM power: Margaret Thatcher reshaped the Conservative Party and government policy through strong leadership, while coalition governments, such as the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition of 2010–2015, show how a Prime Minister can be constrained by formal agreements and the need to accommodate other parties.

## The Cabinet and collective responsibility
The Cabinet is the group of senior ministers, usually heads of major departments, charged with coordinating government policy. In theory Cabinet government rests on collective decision-making, with ministers bound by collective responsibility: once a decision is reached in Cabinet all ministers must publicly support it or resign. Cabinet meetings, committees, and the wider Cabinet Office system provide forums for debate, policy coordination and conflict resolution. The extent to which the Cabinet is genuinely deliberative, however, depends on political context.

When the Prime Minister is dominant, Cabinet can become an instrument for implementing the PM’s agenda; when party management is difficult or the PM is weaker, Cabinet can be an arena for bargaining and dissent. Instances of ministerial resignations, high-profile rebellions on major policy issues (for example, divisions over European integration in the 1990s and 2010s), and choices such as appointing ministers from coalition partners illustrate how Cabinet dynamics affect policy. Cabinet committees often handle detailed policy work, leaving plenary Cabinet meetings to settle strategic issues; the structure and power of these committees are important in understanding where decisions are really taken. The Cabinet also plays a constitutional and symbolic role, lending collective legitimacy to government programmes and providing a visible interface between the executive and Parliament.

## The Civil Service: implementation, expertise and neutrality
The Civil Service provides the permanent administrative backbone of government. Its key tasks are to develop and implement policy, manage public services and departments, provide impartial advice to ministers and ensure continuity of administration across changes of government. The structure is hierarchical, with departments headed by ministers accountable to Parliament and led in administration by permanent secretaries—the most senior civil servants—who oversee day-to-day operations and advise on long-term institutional interests.

A defining feature of the UK Civil Service is political neutrality: civil servants are expected to serve the government of the day regardless of party, giving honest professional advice and executing decisions once they are made. This impartiality underpins public trust and administrative competence, and it provides institutional memory that helps governments of all complexions govern effectively. However, tensions can arise. Ministers may complain about officials’ caution or resistance, while civil servants may warn about the feasibility or legality of political initiatives. The growing use of special advisers—political appointees who work alongside civil servants to promote a minister’s political agenda—has reshaped the interface between politics and administration, sometimes raising questions about neutrality and the visibility of partisan influence.

## Interaction between Prime Minister, Cabinet and Civil Service
The pattern of relationships among the Prime Minister, Cabinet and Civil Service can be described as the ‘core executive’: a network of actors and institutions that together make major decisions. The Prime Minister relies on the Civil Service for policy expertise and implementation, on Cabinet ministers to manage departmental responsibilities and on party structures to sustain parliamentary support. Effective government requires coordination across these elements: the Cabinet Office coordinates policy and performance; the Prime Minister’s private office and advisers manage daily priorities and communication; permanent secretaries and Whitehall boards translate political decisions into administrative action.

Conflict can emerge when ministers seek rapid political responses that clash with civil service assessments or when the PM’s concentration of power marginalises Cabinet debate. Examples from recent decades include tensions over whether decisions are taken collectively or in a smaller ‘kitchen cabinet’ of advisers, debates about the role and influence of special advisers, and public controversies sparked by ministerial resignations or allegations of undue political interference in administration. The balance of these relationships shapes the style of governance: ‘prime ministerial government’ where the PM dominates, ‘cabinet government’ where collective decision-making holds sway, or more fragmented forms where party and departmental interests shape outcomes.

## Accountability and limits: Parliament, courts and public scrutiny
The executive is accountable through multiple channels. Parliament scrutinises government through questions, debates, select committees and votes. Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) is the most visible ritual of parliamentary accountability, but select committees play a crucial role in holding ministers to account for departmental performance and policy detail. Where Parliament is assertive, executive proposals may be amended or blocked; where a government has a large majority, scrutiny can be less effective.

The courts provide legal constraints: judicial review can declare actions unlawful, and the Supreme Court can adjudicate on matters such as the limits of government powers or the legality of decisions taken under the prerogative. The press and wider media, NGOs and pressure groups contribute to transparency by reporting, campaigning and mobilising public opinion. Political accountability is also internal: ministers are held to standards by conventions such as ministerial responsibility, which require resignation for serious errors or misconduct. In practice, the effectiveness of these mechanisms depends on political will, resources, legal interpretations and public engagement.

## Recent developments and challenges
Contemporary developments have tested the classical arrangements of the UK executive. Devolution has introduced powerful subnational executives—Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—creating multi-level governance and complicating the exercise of UK-wide authority. Brexit was a profound strain on the executive, combining negotiation, domestic legislation and party management, and it highlighted the role of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in handling external agreements. Emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic placed unprecedented demands on executive decision-making, raising questions about ministerial accountability, the use of emergency powers and the role of scientific advisers.

Institutional reforms and political trends have also mattered. The expansion of the Prime Minister’s Office, changes to the appointment and role of special advisers, debates over ministerial code and lobbying, and the episodic use of referendums have all affected how the executive operates. Teaching this topic benefits from up-to-date examples that show how constitutional conventions can bend in response to crisis, how personal leadership styles shape state action, and how institutional design interacts with political incentives.

## Teaching and learning this topic
When studying the executive it is important to combine conceptual understanding with concrete examples. Concepts such as the royal prerogative, collective responsibility, ministerial responsibility, political neutrality and the core executive are tools for analysing how government operates. Students should link these concepts to contemporary and historical evidence: landmark events, major resignations, policy shifts and inquiries provide rich material for argument and evaluation. Comparisons across time and with devolved and local executives also help to identify patterns and exceptions. Teachers should encourage students to interrogate sources of power, to weigh competing explanations for governmental behaviour, and to think critically about the effectiveness of different accountability mechanisms.

Use of case studies is particularly effective. For instance, examining how a particular Prime Minister managed Cabinet during a crisis—whether a financial emergency, a referendum or a public health event—allows students to see abstract concepts in action. Similarly, tracing the role of the Civil Service in implementing a contentious policy shows the tensions between political objectives and administrative constraints. Encourage students to assess both the strengths and weaknesses of the executive, recognising that institutional design often contains trade-offs between decisiveness, accountability and expertise.

## Exam technique
In exam answers you must show accurate knowledge (AO1), apply and interpret information (AO2) and analyse and evaluate (AO3). Begin extended answers with a concise introduction that defines key terms and sets out the line of argument. For a question about the extent of the Prime Minister’s power, for example, define what ‘power’ means in context, outline the main sources of PM power, and indicate the criteria you will use to judge its extent. Develop paragraphs that each make a clear point, provide evidence or example, explain how that evidence supports the point and, where appropriate, assess counter-arguments. Use relevant examples to illustrate claims rather than making general assertions. For higher-mark questions make balanced evaluation central: consider arguments for and against, discuss qualifications and limits, and finish with a reasoned judgement which synthesises the analysis.

When addressing source-based or shorter structured questions, focus on precise extraction and application of information, and link facts directly to the question. For synoptic or comparative essays, explicitly link material across the Prime Minister, Cabinet and Civil Service to show how they interact. Time management is crucial: plan answers briefly before writing, allocate time proportional to marks, and leave time to write a brief concluding paragraph that answers the question directly. Practice writing under timed conditions, and in revision prepare a bank of succinct, well-evidenced examples that can be adapted to different questions.
