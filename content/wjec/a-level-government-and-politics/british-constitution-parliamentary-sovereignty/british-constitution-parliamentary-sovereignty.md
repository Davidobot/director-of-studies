# The British Constitution and parliamentary sovereignty (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

## An overview of the British constitution: uncodified and flexible
The British constitution is unlike the single, written constitutions of many other states. It is uncodified, meaning there is no single constitutional document that contains all the rules and principles of government. Instead, our constitution is a living combination of statute law, common law, conventions, works of constitutional authority and historical practice. This gives it flexibility: constitutional arrangements can change incrementally through ordinary legislation, judicial decisions or the evolution of political practice. The chief consequences of this uncodified character are that the constitution can adapt quickly, but it also produces ongoing debate about clarity, rights protection and the balance of power between institutions.

Key constitutional principles are parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, parliamentary government and constitutional monarchy. These ideas sit alongside the practical institutions of government: Parliament, the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Civil Service, the courts, and devolved legislatures such as Senedd Cymru. Understanding how those principles operate in practice is central to analysing British politics.

## Parliamentary sovereignty: what it means in theory and in practice
Parliamentary sovereignty is the doctrine that Parliament has the supreme legal authority to make or unmake any law and that no person or body can override or set aside legislation enacted by Parliament. In its classical formulation, Parliament is legally omnipotent: it can pass any law on any subject and no court may declare an Act of Parliament invalid.

In practice, however, sovereignty is more nuanced. Legal sovereignty remains with Westminster: courts will usually not strike down primary legislation. But political realities place checks on Parliament’s freedom. Governments need parliamentary majorities to pass legislation, elections can remove governments, party discipline and public opinion influence decision-making, and institutions such as the devolved legislatures, international commitments and the judiciary create legal and political constraints. Debates therefore contrast legal sovereignty (the formal principle) with political sovereignty (where real power lies) and with the idea of popular sovereignty (that legitimacy ultimately rests with the people).

A useful way to approach exam questions is to define parliamentary sovereignty clearly, outline how it operates legally, then explore the ways in which it is challenged or constrained in practice.

## Sources of the constitution: statutes, common law, conventions and authority
The constitution draws on several distinct sources. Statute law is the most important single source: Acts of Parliament such as the Bill of Rights (1689), the Acts of Union, the Parliament Acts (1911 and 1949), the Human Rights Act 1998, and more recently the European Communities Act 1972 (until its repeal) and the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 have all had foundational constitutional effects. Devolution has been created by statute too: the Government of Wales Acts and the Scotland Act, which set out the powers of devolved bodies.

Common law decisions by the courts shape constitutional principles such as judicial review and the rule of law. Landmark cases — for example the long-running tradition of protecting civil liberties — have helped to embed legal norms. Constitutional conventions are non-legal rules that govern political behaviour; the Sewel convention (that Westminster will not normally legislate on devolved matters without consent) is an example. Works of constitutional authority — textbooks and historical practice — also inform understanding even if they have no binding force.

Because statutes can alter key arrangements, the uncodified constitution gives Parliament formal ability to change constitutional rules simply by passing legislation, but the political costs and wider consequences of such changes can be substantial.

## The judiciary, the rule of law and judicial review
The rule of law is a central constitutional principle: everyone, including government, is subject to the law and public bodies must act within the legal powers conferred on them. The courts uphold that principle through judicial review and through interpretation of statutes. The Supreme Court, established in its current form in 2009, is the highest domestic court and sits at the centre of several high-profile constitutional disputes.

Recent Supreme Court judgments illustrate the court’s role in constitutional matters. The court’s judgment in the 2017 case about whether the government could trigger Article 50 without parliamentary approval established that executive action that affects rights or changes law requires parliamentary authority. In 2019 the court held that the Prime Minister’s advice to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it frustrated Parliament’s constitutional functions. These decisions do not overturn Acts of Parliament, but they exemplify how courts can interpret constitutional limits, require the executive to seek parliamentary consent and clarify legal boundaries.

Judicial review allows courts to examine whether public bodies — including ministers and devolved administrations — have acted ultra vires (beyond their powers) or have breached rights or procedural fairness. Although UK courts cannot generally strike down primary legislation, they can issue declarations of incompatibility under the Human Rights Act, they can refuse to give effect to unlawful executive actions, and they can interpret statutes in a rights-compliant way where possible. These mechanisms are a legal check on government, operating alongside political checks.

## Devolution, the EU and other challenges to Westminster’s supremacy
Parliamentary sovereignty has been tested by devolution and by the UK’s international commitments. Devolution has created powerful institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with their own legislatures and governments. Legally these devolved powers are granted by Acts of Parliament, so Westminster retains ultimate sovereignty. Politically and practically, however, devolved institutions exercise substantial authority over day-to-day matters. The Sewel convention tries to manage tensions but is a political, not a legal, constraint. The Supreme Court has emphasised that conventions are not generally enforceable by the courts.

Membership of the European Union (and its predecessor arrangements) presented a different challenge because EU law was given supremacy in domestic law through the European Communities Act 1972. That led to a situation where, in certain fields, parliamentary legislation had to be compatible with EU obligations — creating an apparent limitation on the legislative freedom of Westminster. Brexit, following the 2016 referendum and completed legally in 2020, removed EU law supremacy but left a legacy: debates about the location of sovereignty, the use of referendums and how international obligations affect domestic autonomy.

Other challenges come from international human rights institutions and global interdependence. Treaties, international law and membership of organisations require Parliament and government to act within agreed rules. While Parliament can legislate contrary to such obligations, doing so may carry political, legal and diplomatic costs.

## Executive dominance, Parliament’s role and democratic accountability
The UK’s constitutional arrangements produce a close relationship between the executive and the legislature. The Prime Minister and most ministers are drawn from Parliament, and the government normally commands a majority of MPs. This creates a strong executive capacity to set legislative agendas and policy, sometimes leading commentators to describe modern government as an "elective dictatorship" — a government with substantial power subject mainly to electoral checks.

Parliament has several institutional means to hold the executive to account: Prime Minister’s Questions, ministerial statements, select committees, parliamentary debates, votes and the House of Lords’ revising role. Select committees have grown in influence and can conduct detailed inquiries, summon ministers and officials, and publicise issues. The House of Lords can delay legislation and propose amendments, and the Parliament Acts restrict but do not abolish its revising powers. Political factors — party discipline, media scrutiny, backbench rebellions and the electoral cycle — are often as important as formal constitutional mechanisms in constraining the executive.

The balance between effective government and sufficient scrutiny is a recurring theme in debates about reform. Strong government can deliver decisive policy, but insufficient scrutiny risks abuse of power or poor decision-making.

## Debates about reform: codification, rights protection and redistribution of power
There is ongoing debate about whether the UK should adopt a written, codified constitution and whether parliamentary sovereignty should be reshaped. Advocates of codification argue that a single constitutional document would clarify rights, limits on power and institutional roles, reduce uncertainty, and provide stronger protection for civil liberties. Opponents argue that flexibility is a strength, that codification could ossify arrangements, and that entrenched judicial review risks placing too much power in unelected courts.

Related debates focus on bills of rights, reform of the House of Lords, strengthening parliamentary oversight, federalising the UK to resolve tensions created by devolution, and regulating referendums and prerogative powers. Each proposal raises trade-offs between legal protection, democratic accountability, clarity and adaptability. Recent political events — high-profile court cases, debates about the use of prerogative powers, and the Brexit process — have sharpened these questions and provided contemporary examples to use in examination essays.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on the British constitution and parliamentary sovereignty, begin by defining key terms precisely. For parliamentary sovereignty, state the classical legal meaning and then distinguish legal sovereignty from political and popular sovereignty. Use clear examples to support points: statutory examples (Parliament Acts, Human Rights Act, Government of Wales Acts), judicial cases (prorogation and Article 50 decisions), and practical instances of executive dominance or parliamentary scrutiny (select committee inquiries, use of the Parliament Acts).

Structure longer essays with an introduction that defines and frames the debate, several developed paragraphs that explain and analyse different dimensions (legal doctrine, role of the courts, devolution, EU/Brexit, political constraints), and one or two paragraphs that evaluate opposing views. Support evaluation with evidence of change over time and by weighing strengths and weaknesses: for example, explain how devolution and the Human Rights Act have constrained Westminster in practice, then consider why legal sovereignty formally remains with Parliament. Conclude with a balanced judgement that answers the question directly — for instance, whether parliamentary sovereignty is unchanged in law but transformed in practice.

For application questions, bring in contemporary and historical examples to illustrate points. When asked to assess the extent of parliamentary sovereignty, use the Miller judgments, Jackson (Hunting Act) commentary, the repeal of the European Communities Act and the political effects of devolution. If a question demands evaluation, consider short-term and long-term perspectives, distinguishing between legal authority, political power and public legitimacy.

In timed conditions, allocate time roughly as: 10–15 minutes planning (for extended responses), 20–30 minutes writing the main argument, and 5–10 minutes reviewing and refining. Clear definitions, analytical depth, and well-chosen examples score highly.
