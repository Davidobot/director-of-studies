# The Judiciary and the UK Supreme Court (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

## The role and nature of the judiciary in the UK
The judiciary is the branch of government responsible for interpreting and applying the law. In the UK this role sits within a constitutional framework that is uncodified, meaning the powers and limits of the judiciary are shaped by statute, common law, convention and precedent. The courts resolve disputes between individuals, decide criminal guilt, settle civil claims and determine whether public bodies have acted lawfully. At a constitutional level the judiciary protects the rule of law, ensuring that public authorities act within the legal powers granted to them and that citizens’ rights are respected. Unlike in systems with a written constitution empowered to be struck down by judges, UK judges operate in a system shaped by the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty; this creates a distinctive relationship between the courts and Parliament. Understanding that relationship — cooperation, tension and balance — is central to studying the judiciary at A-level.

## The Supreme Court: history, purpose and powers
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest appellate court for civil cases in the UK and for criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It was created by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and came into existence in 2009, replacing the judicial functions of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. The Supreme Court’s principal functions are to hear appeals on points of law of the greatest public importance and to settle disputes about the meaning of legislation. The Court is the final domestic arbiter of legal questions, though its powers are constrained: it cannot invalidate Acts of Parliament, because Parliament is sovereign, but it can issue declarations of incompatibility under the Human Rights Act 1998 where primary legislation cannot be read in a way compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court also plays a constitutional role by clarifying the limits of executive power and the proper meaning of legal doctrines such as ultra vires (acting beyond legal authority).

## Judicial review, ultra vires and constitutional doctrines
Judicial review is the process by which courts examine the lawfulness of actions or decisions made by public bodies and officials. It is not a re-hearing of the merits of a decision but a review of whether the decision was taken lawfully, following correct procedures and within the legal powers available. Key grounds for judicial review include illegality (including ultra vires), irrationality (Wednesbury unreasonableness) and procedural unfairness. The doctrine of ultra vires is fundamental to administrative law: public bodies may only exercise powers that Parliament has granted; if they act beyond those powers the courts can quash the decision. Judicial review thus enforces legal limits on the executive and public administration, supporting accountability and the rule of law while remaining sensitive to legitimate policy-making space. The courts also manage tensions between parliamentary sovereignty and human rights through tools such as interpretation under section 3 of the Human Rights Act and declarations of incompatibility under section 4.

## Landmark cases and their significance
Several modern Supreme Court (and earlier House of Lords) judgments illustrate the constitutional role of the judiciary. In R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (2017) the Supreme Court ruled that the government could not trigger Article 50 to begin Brexit solely by using prerogative power; an Act of Parliament was required. That decision reaffirmed the principle that significant changes to domestic rights and statutory regimes require parliamentary authorisation. In the prorogation case, R (Miller) v The Prime Minister; Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland (2019), the Court held that the Prime Minister’s advice to prorogue Parliament for an extended period in 2019 was unlawful because it frustrated parliamentary scrutiny of the executive. Those cases show the Court policing limits on executive power. Earlier authorities also matter: Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case, 1985) established that exercises of the royal prerogative could be subject to judicial review; Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission (1969) significantly reduced the effect of ouster clauses by treating errors of law as nullifying purported decisions; and Jackson v Attorney General (2005) invited judges to acknowledge that parliamentary sovereignty is a central constitutional principle but not entirely unchallengeable by the courts in the most extreme circumstances. R (Evans) v Attorney General (2015) demonstrated that ministers could not use executive certificates to prevent release of information where statutory interpretation and the courts required disclosure. Together, these cases give students concrete examples to use when explaining how the judiciary shapes the constitution in practice.

## Judicial independence, appointment and accountability
Judicial independence is essential to the rule of law: judges must decide cases free from improper influence. Structural protections include security of tenure, protection against arbitrary removal, and independent remuneration. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 aimed to strengthen independence by creating the Supreme Court separate from Parliament and establishing the Judicial Appointments Commission to recommend candidates for most judicial offices. The appointment process to the Supreme Court involves an independent selection commission whose recommendation is sent to the Lord Chancellor and then to the Prime Minister and monarch for formal appointment; this process is designed to reduce overt political control while retaining some ministerial involvement. Accountability is maintained through reasons published in judgments, adherence to precedent, and ethical codes; judges are also subject to appeal and, in exceptional circumstances, to disciplinary procedures. Debates continue about transparency, diversity of appointments and whether perceived political views of judges undermine public confidence.

## Devolution, Wales and the limits of jurisdictions
Devolution has added complexity to the UK legal map. The Supreme Court hears appeals across the UK and must often consider questions about the competence of devolved institutions. Devolved legislatures and governments exercise powers granted by Westminster; disputes may arise over whether a devolved body has acted within competence. There is an ongoing debate about whether Wales should develop its own distinct legal jurisdiction, separate from England, and whether the Supreme Court should sit or be structured differently to reflect distinct legal identities. Supporters of a Welsh jurisdiction argue that it would better reflect Welsh lawmaking and legal culture, improving clarity and democratic accountability. Opponents warn that separate jurisdictions can increase complexity and cost. For students, it is important to be able to explain how judicial review and the Supreme Court interact with devolution and to use concrete examples of competence disputes when evaluating arguments for reform.

## How judges decide: methods and reasoning
Judges use a mixture of legal rules, precedent and interpretative approaches when deciding cases. The doctrine of stare decisis means that lower courts follow higher court decisions and that the Supreme Court’s decisions are highly persuasive across the system. Statutory interpretation methods include the literal rule, the golden rule and the purposive approach; since the Human Rights Act judges also consider whether legislation can be read compatibly with Convention rights. Judges balance legal materials with principles such as proportionality in rights cases, and they often rely on detailed factual findings, policy context and comparative reasoning. Debates about “judicial activism” versus “judicial restraint” hinge on whether judges are seen as stepping into political decisions; students should be able to explain these approaches and apply them to cases (for example, contrasting a declaratory outcome where the Court highlights an issue but leaves reform to Parliament with a more interventionist judgment that constrains executive action).

## Political controversy, public perception and the protection of rights
The Supreme Court’s constitutional interventions sometimes provoke political controversy. High-profile decisions, especially those touching on Brexit, prorogation or human rights, have been accompanied by significant media attention and political debate. Critics argue that unelected judges intrude on democratic decisions, while defenders emphasize the protection of legal rights, minority interests and the maintenance of constitutional checks and balances. The Court’s role in protecting rights is particularly important where Parliament has not acted; through judicial review and human rights jurisprudence the courts can offer remedies, interpretive guidance and, in some cases, declarations that encourage parliamentary reform. Post-Brexit, the UK’s relationship with European human rights structures has been a further flashpoint; students should be able to assess both the safeguards the judiciary offers and the democratic questions that surround judicial power.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the judiciary and the Supreme Court, begin by clearly defining key terms such as judicial review, parliamentary sovereignty and ultra vires; this secures AO1 marks. Use relevant case law to illustrate each point—Miller (2017), Miller/Cherry (2019), Anisminic, GCHQ and Jackson are particularly useful—and explain the legal principle the case established or clarified. Apply the material to the question rather than simply narrating cases: show how judicial review affects government accountability or how the Supreme Court’s inability to strike down primary legislation shapes limits on judicial power (AO2). For evaluation (AO3), balance arguments for judicial intervention—protection of rights and the rule of law—against counter-arguments about democratic legitimacy and policy-making prerogative. Reach a reasoned judgement that reflects the evidence you have presented; for example, conclude that the Supreme Court is an essential constitutional safeguard but that its role should be exercised with restraint and clear justification. Structure essays with an introduction that outlines your approach, focused analytical paragraphs each developing a single idea with case law and examples, and a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Manage your time so you allocate longer to higher-mark questions, and practise writing judgments that combine precise legal explanation with political evaluation — examiners reward clarity, accurate use of terminology and well-supported conclusions.
