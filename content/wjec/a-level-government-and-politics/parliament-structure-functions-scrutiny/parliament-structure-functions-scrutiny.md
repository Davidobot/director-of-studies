# Parliament: structure, functions and scrutiny (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of Parliament and its constitutional place
Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom and sits at the centre of the UK’s uncodified constitution. It exists as a fusion of historical institutions, statutory provisions and constitutional conventions rather than as a single written document. Its core constitutional principles are parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law and parliamentary government, all operating within a constitutional monarchy. Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can make or unmake any law and that no other body can override primary legislation; in practice that authority is shaped by conventions, devolution settlements and the rules of international membership that once included the European Union. Parliament’s principal functions are to make and amend law, to scrutinise and hold the executive to account, to approve taxation and public expenditure, and to represent the electorate. Understanding Parliament therefore requires attention to formal procedures, informal practices and the balance of power between the executive and the legislature.

## The two Houses: House of Commons and House of Lords
Parliament is bicameral, composed of the elected House of Commons and the unelected House of Lords. The House of Commons is the dominant chamber in terms of democratic legitimacy. Members of Parliament are elected to represent constituencies, to propose and debate legislation, and to scrutinise government policy and ministers. The Speaker presides over proceedings, enforces parliamentary rules and protects the Commons’ privileges; party whips manage discipline and help to secure the government’s legislative programme. The House of Lords acts primarily as a revising chamber. Its members include life peers appointed for their expertise, a small number of hereditary peers and bishops. The Lords examines bills in detail, proposes amendments and conducts investigations through committee work. By convention and by law, the Lords cannot permanently block money bills and their powers to delay secondary legislation are limited by the Parliament Acts. The Lords’ role is less about democratic representation and more about deliberation, expertise and legislative scrutiny, and its composition and legitimacy are frequent subjects of debate and reform proposals.

## How legislation is made and examined
The passage of a bill through Parliament is a staged process designed to test scrutiny and refine proposals. In both Houses a bill normally receives a first reading to introduce it, a second reading for general debate on principles, a committee stage for line-by-line examination, a report stage where amendments are considered, and a third reading before being sent to the other House. If the two Houses disagree, the bill can be sent back and forth in “ping‑pong” until agreement is reached, and the Parliament Acts provide a mechanism by which the Commons can ultimately prevail on certain public bills. Once both Houses agree, the bill receives Royal Assent and becomes an Act of Parliament. In addition to primary legislation, Parliament must contend with a large volume of delegated or secondary legislation made by ministers under powers granted in Acts of Parliament. Scrutiny of delegated legislation takes place through procedures such as affirmative and negative resolutions, but the scope for detailed parliamentary oversight of this flood of subordinate law is a continuing concern. The legislative timetable and the government’s control over parliamentary time are important factors shaping the effectiveness of legislative scrutiny.

## Scrutiny: committees, questions and debates
Scrutiny of the executive is a central feature of Parliament’s function. Mechanisms for that scrutiny include oral questions, Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs), urgent questions, debates in both chambers and the committee system. Departmental select committees in the Commons shadow government departments, call witnesses, publish reports and can force publicity and answers from ministers and officials. The Public Accounts Committee, in particular, investigates value for money and the use of public funds, often producing high-impact reports. Cross‑party and specialist committees in the Lords also conduct inquiries and produce detailed recommendations. Oral questioning allows MPs and peers to press ministers directly; PMQs provides a high-profile weekly forum in which the Prime Minister answers questions from the Leader of the Opposition and backbenchers. While these mechanisms are intended to hold the executive to account, their effectiveness depends on political context: the strength of the government’s parliamentary majority, the discipline exercised by party whips, the willingness of committees to pursue controversial lines of inquiry, and the media and public attention that follows.

## Parliamentary sovereignty, the courts and judicial review
The relationship between Parliament and the judiciary is an important constitutional boundary. Parliament remains sovereign in that primary legislation cannot be struck down by the courts; however, the courts play a key role in interpreting statutes and protecting rights under the Human Rights Act 1998. Judicial review allows the courts to examine the lawfulness of decisions made by ministers, public bodies and administrative agencies, applying the doctrine of ultra vires to rule that actions beyond legal authority are unlawful. Landmark constitutional litigation in recent years has shown how the courts can shape the political process without overruling Parliament’s primary legislation. For example, cases concerning prorogation and the limits of prerogative powers have emphasised the judiciary’s role in ensuring that government action respects constitutional principles and parliamentary sovereignty. The Supreme Court’s ability to adjudicate on constitutional questions and to review executive actions underscores an important mechanism of accountability, even if it does not give the courts power to overturn Acts of Parliament.

## Devolution, multi-level governance and Parliament’s role
The UK is now a multi-level polity in which the UK Parliament shares authority with devolved legislatures such as the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and Senedd Cymru (the Welsh Parliament). Devolution has altered where power sits: certain matters are devolved and others are reserved to Westminster. This arrangement requires mechanisms of intergovernmental working and affects parliamentary scrutiny because UK legislation can have consequences for devolved competence. The UK Parliament retains legal sovereignty and can, in theory, legislate on devolved matters, but constitutional conventions, political realities and the Sewel Convention govern such interactions. At the same time, MPs representing constituencies across the UK continue to hold the UK government to account for reserved matters, while Members of the devolved legislatures scrutinise their respective executives. Understanding Parliament today therefore involves comparing how scrutiny operates vertically between levels of government and how devolution changes the accountability landscape.

## Strengths, weaknesses and reform debates about scrutiny
Parliament performs essential democratic functions, but its capacity to scrutinise effectively is often contested. Strengths include the visibility and legitimacy of the Commons, the expertise and investigative capacity of select committees, and the deliberative role of the Lords. Weaknesses commonly identified are executive dominance, particularly when governments have a large majority and tight Whip control; the limited time available to scrutinise the volume of legislation and delegated powers; and the theatrical nature of some scrutiny forums where point-scoring can trump sustained critical interrogation. Concerns have also been raised about the composition of the Lords and the democratic legitimacy of its powers, the growing use of secondary legislation to bypass full parliamentary debate, and the potential for “elective dictatorship” where the elected government’s control of the Commons enables it to act with limited effective resistance. Proposed reforms to strengthen scrutiny include better resourcing and powers for committees, reforms to the timetable-setting processes to allow more time for debate, limits on the use of Henry VIII clauses that enable ministers to amend primary legislation by secondary means, and debates about codifying aspects of the constitution to protect parliamentary roles more clearly. These are ongoing political questions that frequently feature in exam essays; being able to weigh strengths, limitations and reform proposals is critical for evaluation.

## Exam technique
When answering examination questions on Parliament, start by making clear definitions and setting out the conceptual framework you will use. Define key terms such as parliamentary sovereignty, scrutiny, collective and individual ministerial responsibility, and make sure your answer is directly focused on the question’s command word (explain, assess, evaluate, discuss). Use precise institutional descriptions to secure AO1 marks: describe the structure of the Commons and Lords, outline the stages of the legislative process, and explain mechanisms such as select committees, PMQs, and judicial review. To hit AO2, apply these descriptions to concrete examples: name relevant procedures (committee inquiry reports, affirmative instruments), describe the operation of PMQs as a scrutiny forum, or discuss how the Supreme Court has intervened in prorogation disputes. For AO3, move beyond description to analysis and evaluation: consider how effective each scrutiny mechanism is in practice, weigh the impact of government majorities or party discipline, and draw reasoned conclusions about whether Parliament fulfils its functions. Structure longer answers with a clear introduction, a series of balanced analytical paragraphs each focused on a distinct point, and a conclusion that reaches a judgement that answers the question. Always support claims with contemporary or historically significant examples—such as select committee impacts, the limits imposed by the Parliament Acts, or judicial review outcomes—while avoiding long unsubstantiated assertions. Finally, manage time by planning briefly, leaving time to evaluate, and ensuring your conclusion synthesises the analysis rather than merely repeating earlier material.
