# US Constitution, federalism and the Bill of Rights (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of the Constitution and its significance
The United States Constitution is the founding legal document of American government and remains unusually concise and durable for its age. Written in 1787 and ratified in 1789, it establishes the framework of a republican system built on the separation of powers and checks and balances among institutions. Unlike the uncodified and evolving British constitution, the US Constitution is a single written text with entrenched procedures for amendment. Its brevity is part of its strength: broad clauses, such as the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause, allow the Constitution to be applied to circumstances the framers could not have imagined. The document has also proved adaptable through formal amendments and judicial interpretation. The first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, were added shortly after ratification to secure fundamental civil liberties and to reassure those who feared an overly powerful central government.

## Fundamental principles: republicanism, separation of powers and federalism
At the heart of the Constitution lie several interlocking principles. Republicanism underpins the idea that the people are sovereign and exercise that sovereignty through elected representatives. That principle is reinforced by the separation of powers, which divides authority among a legislative branch that makes laws, an executive that enforces them, and a judiciary that interprets them. Checks and balances are designed so that no single branch becomes dominant: the president can veto legislation, Congress can override vetoes and control budgets, and the courts can declare acts unconstitutional. Federalism is central to American political organisation, creating a system in which power is shared between the national government and the states. The Constitution allocates certain enumerated powers to Congress, reserves other powers to the states via the Tenth Amendment, and establishes the Supremacy Clause to resolve conflicts in favour of federal law where the Constitution allows. Together these principles produce a tension between national coherence and state diversity that runs through much of US political history.

## Federalism in practice: doctrines, tensions and evolution
Federalism under the Constitution is both a legal doctrine and a political process that has changed substantially over time. The early landmark case McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) confirmed that Congress possesses implied powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause and that states cannot tax federal institutions, thereby establishing federal supremacy when grounded in constitutional authority. The Commerce Clause has been the other major battlefield. In the twentieth century, decisions such as Wickard v. Filburn expanded federal reach by interpreting the Commerce Clause broadly, enabling Congress to regulate economic and social life on a national scale. During the late twentieth century the Court began to limit that reach, notably in United States v. Lopez (1995), which marked a revival of limits on Congress’s commerce power. Federalism also operates through fiscal mechanisms: the federal government uses grants, conditional funding and mandates to influence state policy, a practice sometimes called cooperative federalism. Famous examples include conditional federal funding for highway programs tied to national standards such as the minimum drinking age, upheld in South Dakota v. Dole. Contemporary disputes over federalism are visible in issues like marijuana legalization, where state law and federal prohibition collide, and in the shifting landscape after decisions such as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022), which returned the regulation of abortion to the states.

## The branches of government and constitutional checks
The Constitution creates distinct roles for Congress, the presidency and the Supreme Court, each with constitutional grants and constraints that structure American politics. Article I vests legislative power in a bicameral Congress, with the House of Representatives chosen to reflect population and the Senate designed to protect states’ interests. Congress’s enumerated powers include taxation, spending, regulation of interstate commerce and the ability to declare war, yet many of these powers have been interpreted expansively over time. Article II sets out the presidency, granting the president executive authority, the role of commander-in-chief, and powers of appointment and treaty negotiation subject to Senate advice and consent. The office has grown in scope and influence, particularly in foreign policy and national security, but remains constrained by congressional checks and judicial review. The federal judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court under Article III, plays the decisive role in interpreting the Constitution. Judicial review—the power to invalidate laws and executive acts inconsistent with the Constitution—was established in practice by Marbury v. Madison (1803). That decision is central to understanding how the Constitution is applied and why the composition of the Supreme Court can have far-reaching effects on public policy.

## The Bill of Rights and incorporation of civil liberties
The Bill of Rights, originally conceived to limit only the federal government, enumerated key individual rights such as free speech, free exercise and establishment of religion, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, and protections in criminal proceedings. For much of the nineteenth century these protections were not applied to the states. Beginning in the twentieth century, however, the Supreme Court developed the doctrine of selective incorporation through the Fourteenth Amendment, using the Due Process Clause to apply most, though not all, fundamental rights against state governments. Key cases illustrate how rights have been interpreted and contested: the expansion of free speech protections, the evolving jurisprudence around the right to privacy, and the contentious debates over gun ownership and capital punishment. Contemporary issues illustrate how the Bill of Rights remains a live battleground: disputes about the scope of free speech in the digital age, challenges to gun regulation under the Second Amendment, and shifting protections for reproductive privacy following major recent rulings have all forced courts, legislatures and the public to balance individual liberties against competing societal interests.

## Constitutional amendment, interpretation and contemporary debates
The Constitution provides an intentionally difficult amendment procedure in Article V, requiring either a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states, or a convention called by two-thirds of state legislatures followed by the same ratification threshold. This high bar explains why formal amendments have been relatively rare and why constitutional change often comes through judicial interpretation, political practice, and statutes. The document’s flexibility allows it to respond to changing circumstances, but it also generates debates about democratic legitimacy, judicial activism and originalism. Some argue that landmark social changes have rightly been achieved through judicial enforcement of rights; others insist that major policy shifts should come through the political process and amendment. The balance between national power and states’ autonomy continues to provoke political contestation, whether on healthcare, immigration, environmental regulation or civil rights. Understanding these debates requires both knowledge of textual provisions and familiarity with key cases and political dynamics that shape how the Constitution functions in practice.

## Teaching points and useful examples
When studying the Constitution, it helps to connect abstract principles with concrete cases and episodes. Marbury v. Madison provides a clear example of judicial review in practice, while McCulloch v. Maryland illustrates implied powers and supremacy. The commerce clause’s expansive and contracted phases are visible in Wickard v. Filburn and United States v. Lopez, respectively, and fiscal federalism’s leverage is apparent in South Dakota v. Dole. The incorporation of the Bill of Rights through the Fourteenth Amendment can be traced through cases like Gitlow and later decisions that applied privacy protections. Contemporary decisions such as Obergefell on same-sex marriage and Dobbs on abortion underscore how constitutional interpretation can alter the distribution of rights and responsibilities between federal and state governments. Using these cases as narrative anchors helps students see how legal doctrines evolve and why the composition of courts, the ideological climate in Congress and societal change all matter.

## Exam technique
To succeed in A-level questions on the US Constitution, federalism and the Bill of Rights, structure answers clearly and balance description with analysis and evaluation. Begin by defining key terms and stating the constitutional provisions or principles at issue. Demonstrate knowledge with precise examples: name relevant constitutional articles or amendments and summarise landmark cases concisely, including the year and the legal principle established. Apply theory to practice by explaining how a principle operates in concrete disputes, and evaluate with consideration of counterarguments, limitations and consequences. For longer essays allocate time to plan, write and leave a few minutes to refine your conclusion; for shorter questions focus on accuracy and selectivity of evidence. Make sure each paragraph has a clear point, supporting evidence and a sentence that links that evidence to the overall argument. Use comparisons where relevant, for example contrasting national and state perspectives or different judicial doctrines. Finally, link your final judgement to the criteria of the question: if asked whether the Constitution protects rights adequately, weigh the strengths of constitutional protections against examples where rights were limited or shifted, and reach a reasoned, evidence-based conclusion.
