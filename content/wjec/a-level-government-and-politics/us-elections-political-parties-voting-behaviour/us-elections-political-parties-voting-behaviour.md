# US elections, political parties and voting behaviour (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

US elections are central to understanding American government and global politics. The way Americans choose their leaders shapes policymaking, defines the balance of federal and state power, and produces recurring debates about representation, fairness and democracy. For A-level study, the focus is on the mechanics of presidential and congressional contests, the role of parties and factions, and the explanations for why different groups vote as they do. This guide brings together the key facts you need, explains how different parts of the system interact, and shows how to use contemporary examples to support analysis and evaluation.

## The presidential electoral process: from invisible primary to Electoral College

Presidential contests in the United States unfold over a prolonged cycle that begins long before ballots are cast. Potential candidates first engage in the “invisible primary,” competing for endorsements, donors and media attention; success here can determine who becomes a serious contender. The formal nominating stage then proceeds via primaries and caucuses in each state, where voters select delegates to national conventions. Primaries are state-run elections and can be open, allowing cross-party participation, or closed, restricted to registered party members. Caucuses are party-run local meetings that select delegates through discussion and voting; they tend to favour highly motivated activists.

After the primary season, each major party formally chooses its nominee at a national convention, and the campaign moves to the general election. The general election is decided not by a nationwide popular vote but by the Electoral College, a state-based system in which each state’s electors (equal to its congressional delegation) cast the decisive ballots. There are 538 electors in total and a candidate needs a majority to win. Most states award electors on a winner-takes-all basis, which means campaigns concentrate resources on competitive “swing states” where small shifts in votes can decide the entire election. This structure explains why a candidate can win a majority of the popular vote but lose the Electoral College, a result that has occurred in modern elections and remains a central criticism of the system.

## Campaign finance, media and modern campaigning

Money and media shape contemporary American elections. Campaigns rely on fundraising to buy advertising, staff operations, polling and digital targeting. Political Action Committees (PACs) and independent expenditure groups, including so-called super-PACs, can raise and spend large sums to support or oppose candidates. Changes in the legal framework governing campaign finance have permitted substantial independent spending by corporations and interest groups, amplifying the role of outside money and prompting concerns about unequal influence.

Television advertising, debates and endorsements remain important, but the rise of social media and targeted digital advertising has transformed message delivery. Campaigns now micro-target voters with tailored messages and use rapid-response teams to shape narratives. This environment accelerates news cycles and magnifies the role of viral moments and media framing. Consequently, elections are contested not only in rallies and town halls but across broadcast and digital spaces, producing both opportunities for mobilising supporters and risks from misinformation or rapid reputational damage.

## Models of voting behaviour and long-term determinants

To explain why people vote as they do, political scientists use several complementary models. The sociological model locates voting behaviour in social identity and group membership: class, race and ethnicity, religion, region and gender form durable partisan attachments. The rational choice model treats voters as utility-maximisers who assess policies, costs and benefits before choosing. The valence model emphasises competence and performance: voters reward candidates or parties they perceive as able to deliver results on key issues such as the economy or national security.

Long-term determinants include socio-economic status, race and ethnicity, and geography. Historically, patterns such as the New Deal coalition showed a strong linkage between working-class voters and the Democratic Party, while the South realigned over decades to become largely Republican. Race remains a critical predictor: minority groups have differing partisan loyalties shaped by historical experience and policy responses. Religion and age are also significant, with evangelical Christians tending toward conservative candidates and younger voters often leaning more liberal. These structural factors explain persistent core coalitions and why parties cultivate specific demographic constituencies.

## Short-term influences: campaigns, candidates and context

Short-term factors can shift election outcomes even when long-term attachments are strong. Candidate qualities—perceived competence, charisma and integrity—shape voter choices. Incumbency provides significant advantages in congressional and presidential politics through name recognition, fundraising networks and a record to campaign on, though incumbency can also be a liability if the electorate is dissatisfied.

Campaigns matter because they can highlight issues, define opponents and mobilise or demobilise voters. Economic performance shortly before an election is a powerful short-term determinant; voters tend to reward governments for prosperity and punish them for downturns, a classic example of retrospective voting. Scandals, major events and foreign crises can rapidly alter public opinion. The existence of swing states makes tactical campaigning crucial: resources are allocated where they matter most, and small shifts in turnout or opinion in key states can determine the outcome.

## Political parties, factions and the two-party system

The American party system is dominated by two major parties, Democrats and Republicans, but within each party there are significant factions that influence policy and electoral strategy. The Republican coalition has included business conservatives, social conservatives such as the Religious Right, and libertarian-leaning groups, while more recent movements like the Tea Party reshaped priorities around limited government. The Democratic coalition blends labour, minority groups, progressive activists and moderates; tensions between progressive and centrist wings affect platform choices and campaign messages.

Third parties and independent candidates sometimes play influential roles, particularly by introducing new issues or drawing votes away from major-party candidates in close contests. While third-party candidates rarely win national office, historical examples show they can affect the outcome by altering vote shares in crucial states. The two-party dominance is reinforced by institutional rules, ballot access laws and the Electoral College, which together make durable third-party breakthroughs difficult.

## Voter turnout, participation and barriers

Voter turnout in the United States is lower than in many other advanced democracies, especially in non-presidential elections. Structural factors contribute to this: registration is largely the responsibility of the individual voter and can create hurdles; voting procedures vary by state and include differing rules on early voting, absentee ballots and voter identification requirements. Debates about voter access often centre on whether measures intended to prevent fraud have the side effect of suppressing turnout among certain groups.

Other barriers include the timing of elections on weekdays, restrictive registration deadlines, and laws that restrict voting rights for people with felony convictions in some states. Political disengagement, perceptions of inefficacy, and the feeling that one’s vote does not matter under the Electoral College or in heavily partisan states also depress turnout. Conversely, high-salience elections, strong mobilisation efforts by parties and groups, and easy access through early or mail voting can increase participation.

## Applying the evidence: examples and contemporary context

Illustrating theoretical points with concrete examples strengthens analysis. The mechanics of the caucus system help explain why early states like Iowa punch above their weight in shaping momentum for candidates, while the winner-takes-all nature of most state elector allocation explains why campaigns disproportionately target a small number of competitive states. Legal changes and court rulings on campaign finance have transformed the money landscape, increasing the role of independent spending. Demographic shifts, such as increasing urbanisation and changes in minority populations, alter the electoral map over time and have led parties to recalibrate strategies. Episodes when the Electoral College produced a different winner from the national popular vote highlight debates over democratic legitimacy and proposals for reform.

When using examples, link them explicitly to the question you are answering. Historical or recent electoral outcomes can illustrate long-term realignments, the impact of economic performance, or the effectiveness of campaign strategies. Always explain why the example matters, how it supports your analysis, and whether it has limits as evidence.

## Exam technique

When answering WJEC questions on US elections, political parties and voting behaviour, keep the assessment objectives in mind. AO1 requires clear, accurate knowledge: define key institutions and processes such as primaries, the Electoral College, PACs and the major party factions. AO2 expects you to interpret and apply political information: use examples to show how structures like winner-takes-all elector allocation shape campaign strategy, or how demographic patterns translate into voting blocs. AO3 demands analysis and evaluation: weigh competing explanations for voting behaviour, discuss the strengths and limitations of models, and evaluate reform proposals such as changes to the Electoral College or campaign finance rules.

For short-answer questions provide concise factual points directly answering the question. For essay questions plan a clear structure with an introduction that defines terms and outlines your argument, body paragraphs that develop analytical points supported by evidence, and a conclusion that answers the question and evaluates the significance of your findings. Balance description with analysis: examiners reward well-explained links between cause and effect and critical engagement with evidence. Use contemporary and historical examples to illustrate claims, but ensure each example is clearly tied back to your argument. Time management is crucial: allocate time to planning, writing and reviewing, and ensure you address all parts of multi-part questions. Finally, practise writing essays under timed conditions and seek feedback to improve clarity, depth and evaluative judgement.
