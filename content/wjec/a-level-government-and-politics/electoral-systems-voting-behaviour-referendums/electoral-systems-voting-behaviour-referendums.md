# Electoral systems, voting behaviour and referendums (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

## Why electoral systems matter
Electoral systems are the rules by which votes are translated into political power. They shape the incentives of parties and candidates, influence voter choices and determine how representative and stable governments are. At one extreme, a highly proportional system aims to mirror the share of votes in the share of seats, giving smaller parties a realistic chance of representation. At the other extreme, majoritarian systems tend to produce single-party governments and clearer lines of accountability, but at the cost of “wasted” votes and potential distortion between votes cast and seats won. For students of government and politics, understanding electoral systems is essential because the system in use affects party strategies, the nature of political competition, the degree of voter choice and the overall health of democracy. In the UK context this matters at many levels: the Westminster Parliament uses First Past the Post (FPTP), the Senedd Cymru (Welsh Parliament) and the Scottish Parliament use the Additional Member System (AMS), Northern Ireland uses the Single Transferable Vote (STV) and different systems have been used for various referendums and mayoral elections. Each of these arrangements produces different political outcomes and trade-offs.

## Main types of electoral systems and how they work
First Past the Post (FPTP) is the simplest and most familiar system in UK general elections. Each constituency elects one MP; the candidate with the most votes wins, even if they do not achieve an absolute majority. FPTP tends to favour larger, geographically concentrated parties and usually produces single-party governments. The Additional Member System (AMS), used for the Senedd and the Scottish Parliament, combines single-member constituency seats with top-up list seats to improve proportionality. Voters typically have two votes: one for a constituency representative and one for a regional party list. Party List systems, common across many European parliaments, allocate seats to parties according to their share of the vote on closed or open lists, producing outcomes that are much closer to proportional. The Single Transferable Vote (STV), used in Northern Ireland and in Scottish local council elections, is a preferential system in multi-member constituencies where voters rank candidates; surplus and eliminated votes are transferred according to preferences, which reduces wasted votes and can produce proportional results while preserving voter choice between candidates. There are also hybrid and supplementary systems, such as the Supplementary Vote used for some mayoral contests, which require a second-preference mechanism but are simpler than full STV. Each system has its own logic for how votes become representation and each creates different strategic calculations for voters and parties.

## Effects of systems on parties, governments and representation
Electoral systems have profound effects on party systems and government formation. Majoritarian systems like FPTP usually encourage two-party competition, concentrated geographic support and incentives for tactical voting. They also tend to exaggerate the seat share of the largest party, turning pluralities into clear parliamentary majorities. This can make government formation straightforward and stable, but it often produces a legislature that does not reflect the diversity of voters’ preferences. Proportional systems, by contrast, usually produce multi-party systems, coalition or minority governments and a legislature that more closely matches the vote shares of parties. The Additional Member System aims to strike a balance between constituency link and proportionality, but it can still permit disproportional results if regional top-ups do not fully compensate for constituency distortions. The Single Transferable Vote fosters intra-party competition and gives voters finer-grained choice of individual candidates, which can strengthen local accountability but complicate party cohesion. Real-world examples include the success of the Scottish National Party in certain Westminster elections under FPTP, where concentrated support led to a disproportionate number of seats, and the more proportional representation of smaller parties in devolved legislatures that use AMS or STV.

## Voting behaviour: models and long-term influences
Scholars explain voting behaviour through competing models that highlight different drivers. The sociological model emphasises long-term social structures such as class, region, religion and ethnicity. Historically in Britain, class was a powerful predictor of party support, with working-class voters leaning towards Labour and middle/upper classes more likely to support Conservatives. Over recent decades, however, class alignment has weakened, a process often described as partisan dealignment. The rational choice model portrays voters as utility-maximising actors who weigh the direct benefits and costs of policy choices and the expected competence of parties. The valence model focuses on voters’ judgements about competence, integrity and economic management; under this view, voters favour parties perceived to be competent on key issues. Long-term factors like social class, education, age and regional identity still shape voting tendencies, but they interact with party policies, leadership evaluations and the political context. For example, the rise of questions over national identity, notably Brexit and Scottish independence, reshaped long-standing party loyalties and produced major realignments in recent UK elections.

## Short-term influences, campaign effects and tactical voting
Short-term factors can swing results within electoral cycles. Personal popularity of leaders, the state of the economy, high-profile events and media coverage all play an important role. Campaigns can matter disproportionately in marginal constituencies where small swings decide seats, particularly under FPTP. Tactical voting, where voters choose a less-preferred but more viable candidate to block a worse outcome, is an important phenomenon in plurality systems and is often organised by campaigns that try to maximise the chance of defeating a particular party in specific constituencies. The expansion of social media and targeted digital campaigning has changed the landscape of short-term influence, enabling micro-targeting and rapid message circulation but also raising concerns about misinformation and unequal access to campaign resources. Examples of short-term effects include the influence of the 2008 financial crisis on incumbent parties in many countries and the role of leadership debates or scandal in shifting support close to an election.

## Turnout, participation and the legitimacy of outcomes
Turnout rates are a vital indicator of democratic engagement and affect the legitimacy of elected governments and referendum results. Lower turnout can reflect apathy, alienation, registration barriers or a sense that one’s vote will not matter. Systems that produce many “wasted” votes can exacerbate non-participation by making voters feel unrepresented. Conversely, referendums can stimulate engagement on single issues, sometimes producing higher turnout than off-cycle elections, but they can also polarise and simplify complex choices. Compulsory voting systems produce higher turnout but raise normative questions about voluntary civic engagement. The unequal distribution of turnout — for example, by age, education or income — skews representation because some groups are systematically under-represented. This has practical consequences: if younger voters and lower-income groups participate less, policies may skew away from their preferences. Understanding turnout therefore requires attention to both institutional features and socio-economic inequalities.

## Referendums: purpose, design and controversies
Referendums are instruments of direct democracy used to decide specific questions, often on constitutional or major policy issues. They have been used in the UK and Wales for devolution, electoral reform and membership of international organisations. Referendum design matters: the framing of the question, the timing, the choice of electorate, whether the result is legally binding or advisory and whether a simple majority or a supermajority or turnout threshold is required all shape the meaning and consequences of the result. The 2016 UK referendum on EU membership produced a narrow leave majority and generated prolonged debate about the interpretation of a simple majority and about the democratic legitimacy of subsequent parliamentary and executive actions. The 2011 UK referendum on the Alternative Vote resulted in rejection of AV by a clear margin, showing how voters may resist systemic change even where turnout is moderate. The 2014 Scottish independence referendum produced a high turnout and a clear decision to remain in the UK, but the politics around the question continued to shape Scottish and UK politics thereafter. In Wales, the 1997 devolution referendum produced a narrow “yes”, which led to the establishment of the Welsh Assembly (now Senedd), and a 2011 referendum gave the Senedd greater law-making powers with a far clearer majority. Critics argue that referendums can oversimplify complex issues, allow emotional or misleading campaigning to dominate and bypass representative deliberation, while proponents contend that referendums provide direct legitimacy for fundamental constitutional changes and empower citizens to make definitive choices.

## Interaction, consequences and recent UK realignments
Electoral systems, voting behaviour and referendums interact to produce broader patterns of political realignment. The Brexit referendum reorganised traditional party loyalties across Britain, diminishing the predictive power of class and strengthening divides between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, between older and younger voters, and between different education levels. Under FPTP, these shifts translated into large parliamentary consequences in general elections, amplifying the effect of geographic concentrations of support. Devolved institutions with proportional or mixed systems produced very different party landscapes: the prominence of smaller parties and coalitions in the Senedd or Scottish Parliament contrasts with the Westminster dominance of larger parties. Political movements and social change likewise feed back into voting systems; pressure for electoral reform and debates about referendums are themselves products of dissatisfaction with representation and the desire for more direct forms of accountability. As a student, tracing these interactions helps explain why similar shifts in public opinion can produce very different outcomes under different institutional arrangements.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on electoral systems, voting behaviour or referendums, start by ensuring you understand the precise focus of the question and identify which assessment objectives you must meet. For description and explanation (AO1 and AO2) give clear definitions and outline how systems work, using specific, well-chosen examples such as the use of AMS in the Senedd, STV in Northern Ireland or the 2016 EU referendum. For analysis and evaluation (AO3) balance strengths and weaknesses: explain trade-offs between proportionality and governability, consider empirical consequences (for example, how FPTP can exaggerate seat shares) and assess normative claims about representation and legitimacy. Use structured paragraphs that explicitly link evidence to your argument, and where appropriate evaluate counter-arguments to demonstrate critical judgment. In longer essays, signpost your line of argument in the introduction and conclude with a reasoned judgement that synthesises the points you have made. Time management is essential: allocate time proportionally to the marks available, leave a few minutes to proofread, and ensure any use of examples is precise and relevant. Finally, practitioners’ vocabulary matters: use the correct terminology (for example, “proportionality”, “tactical voting”, “turnout”, “binding vs advisory referendum”) and, where helpful, quantify points with clear examples rather than vague generalities. This approach will meet the specification’s emphasis on knowledge, interpretation and evaluative skill, and will help you achieve higher AO1, AO2 and AO3 marks.
