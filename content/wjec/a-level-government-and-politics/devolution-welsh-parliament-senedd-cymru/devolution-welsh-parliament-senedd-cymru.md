# Devolution and the Welsh Parliament (Senedd Cymru) (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

## Devolution and the UK constitution: the essentials
Devolution is the statutory transfer of powers from the UK Parliament to institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is important to remember that devolution in the UK is asymmetric and rooted in an uncodified constitution: powers given to devolved institutions are granted by Acts of the UK Parliament and can, in theory, be amended or removed by Parliament. For Wales this has meant an evolving set of competences and institutions rather than a single, fixed settlement. The key constitutional principles at play are parliamentary sovereignty (the UK Parliament is supreme), the rule of law (government must act within the law), and the increasingly important idea of multi-level governance, where decisions affecting citizens can be made at UK, Welsh and—sometimes—local levels. This constitutional framework shapes how the Welsh Parliament (Senedd Cymru) operates and how its powers interact with those of Westminster and other devolved bodies.

## The development of Welsh devolution
Welsh devolution has been gradual. The first step was the creation of the National Assembly for Wales in 1999, following a narrow referendum, which combined executive and legislative functions in a single body. Subsequent reform separated government and legislature more clearly and expanded law-making powers. The Government of Wales Act 2006 made provision for a distinct Welsh Government and a clearer legislative process. A 2011 referendum authorised the Assembly to make primary legislation in devolved areas without needing specific orders from Westminster, a major step towards legislative autonomy. The later shift from a “conferred powers” model to a “reserved powers” model clarified that the Senedd can pass laws on anything not explicitly reserved to Westminster. The body’s change of name to Senedd Cymru (often shortened to the Senedd) and the renaming of its members as Members of the Senedd (MSs) reflect its evolution from an assembly to a parliament with a stronger constitutional identity.

## Composition, electoral system and internal organisation
The Senedd has sixty members elected under the Additional Member System, a mixed system combining constituency first-past-the-post members and regional top-up members. This hybrid design preserves single-member constituencies while improving proportionality through regional lists. Members sit in a single chamber. The Senedd’s internal organisation includes plenary sessions, committees with policy-specific remits, and party groups. Committees are particularly important: they scrutinise legislation, conduct inquiries, and hold the Welsh Government to account. Question time, especially First Minister’s Questions, provides regular public scrutiny and political debate. The mixed electoral system tends to produce multi-party representation and has led to governments that are single-party majorities, single-party minorities, or formal coalitions. The pattern of party competition in Wales—where Labour has historically been strongest but where Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats also influence politics—shapes both policy outcomes and the nature of accountability.

## The Senedd’s powers and the legislative process
The Senedd legislates in devolved areas such as health, education, housing, local government, transport, the environment and certain taxation powers. Under the reserved powers model, matters like defence, foreign policy, immigration and most social security remain the responsibility of the UK Parliament. The legislative process in the Senedd allows the passage of Acts (previously Measures) within devolved fields. Bills are considered through stages in committee and in plenary, and committees play a central role in scrutinising the detail and gathering evidence. The Senedd’s ability to make primary legislation gives it substantial policy autonomy in devolved fields, which has produced observable differences in public services between Wales and England. However, questions sometimes arise about the limits of competence, and disputes over whether particular actions are within devolved competence have been subject to legal challenge, bringing the UK courts into the picture.

## The Welsh Government, accountability and the First Minister
The Welsh Government is the executive drawn from the Senedd and led by the First Minister. It proposes legislation, sets policy priorities and implements decisions through ministers and a Welsh civil service. The First Minister is elected by the Senedd and appoints Cabinet ministers responsible for portfolios such as health or education. Collective responsibility and ministerial responsibility apply in Wales as they do at Westminster, though the scale and scope of the Welsh Government mean some differences in style and emphasis. Accountability mechanisms include committee scrutiny, plenary questions, legislative amendments proposed by MSs, and external auditing bodies. The Senedd’s committees and Regular question sessions are the main forums for holding ministers to account, and high-profile policy choices expose the government to public and political scrutiny. Political dynamics—whether the government is a coalition, a minority administration or a party with a narrow majority—affect how robustly ministers are challenged and how compromises shape policy.

## Devolution in practice: policy divergence and examples
Devolution has produced notable policy divergence between Wales and the rest of the UK. Health and education are two areas where differences are clear: for example, prescription charges have been abolished in Wales while they exist elsewhere, and school funding priorities, curriculum developments and approaches to higher education student support have diverged from policies in England. Environmental policy, planning and transport can also reflect distinct Welsh priorities. Devolution allows the Senedd to adopt policies tailored to Wales’s social and economic context, and to experiment with different approaches. These differences have practical consequences for citizens and provide material for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of devolution: supporters argue that local control leads to more responsive policymaking, while critics point to fragmentation, extra complexity and potential inefficiencies.

## Intergovernmental relations, legal issues and future debates
The interplay between the Senedd and Westminster requires intergovernmental coordination, often managed through ministerial forums and formal meetings. Brexit underlined both the limits of devolved powers and the importance of negotiation between governments: powers repatriated from the EU raised questions about which level of government should control new competences. The courts have been asked to determine the boundaries of competence in some disputes, and the shared legal jurisdiction of England and Wales continues to provoke debate about whether Wales needs a distinct legal jurisdiction. There are ongoing political discussions about further devolution, fiscal powers, and even independence. Parties and constituencies in Wales differ in their appetite for more powers: some advocate incremental extension of fiscal and law-making powers, while others press for a clearer constitutional settlement or increased collaboration across the UK. Understanding these debates means appreciating the constitutional principles involved, the political incentives of parties and governments, and the practical consequences for citizens.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on devolution and the Senedd, start by making sure you clearly define key terms such as devolution, reserved powers, competence and parliamentary sovereignty. Use this definition as the foundation for your argument so markers know you understand the constitutional context. For shorter knowledge questions, aim for concise and accurate explanation: outline the Senedd’s composition, its electoral system, the main devolved areas and the difference between conferred and reserved powers. For evaluation and essay questions, structure your response with clear paragraphs that map onto the assessment objectives: demonstrate knowledge (AO1) with accurate facts and examples, apply and interpret information (AO2) by comparing Wales to other parts of the UK or to previous arrangements, and analyse and evaluate (AO3) by weighing strengths and weaknesses before giving a supported judgement. Always use contemporary and familiar examples—policy differences such as prescription charges, educational approaches, the One Wales coalition, or the changes to the Senedd’s status—to illustrate points and to show relevance.

In practice, link evidence directly to the question rather than listing facts. If a question asks whether devolution has increased Welsh democracy, state what “increased democracy” would mean (more local accountability, greater policy responsiveness), evaluate the Senedd’s powers and scrutiny mechanisms against that standard, consider counter-arguments (for example the limits of fiscal autonomy and the Westminster Parliament’s supremacy), and conclude with a balanced judgement. Time management is essential in the 1 hour 30 minute papers: allocate time in proportion to the marks available, leave time to plan longer responses, and reserve a few minutes to check that your final paragraph answers the question directly. Use political vocabulary precisely, signpost your argument so the examiner can follow your reasoning, and where possible, frame your conclusion in terms of trade-offs rather than absolute claims.
