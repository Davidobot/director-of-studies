# Political parties, pressure groups and social movements (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: why these actors matter
Political parties, pressure groups and social movements are central to how modern democracies function. They link citizens to government, aggregate interests, shape public debate and compete for power and influence. At A-level it helps to think of parties as organisations that seek to win office and run government, pressure groups as organisations that seek to influence government without necessarily standing for election, and social movements as looser networks or campaigns that aim to change culture, policy or public priorities. All three interact with institutions—Parliament, the Welsh Parliament (Senedd Cymru), ministers, the courts and the media—and with each other, and their roles are shaped by features of the political system such as the constitution, electoral rules and the structure of devolution.

## Political parties: roles, organisation and change
Political parties perform a cluster of functions: they aggregate interests into coherent programmes, select and promote candidates, provide a route into government, organise opposition, and help to socialise citizens into political life. In the UK context parties operate across different levels of government, from local councils to the Senedd and Westminster, and the devolution settlements have created distinctive party dynamics in Wales and the other nations of the UK. Parties differ in organisation and ideology. Traditional mass parties built around trade unions or religious communities gave way in many places to catch-all and professionalised parties that seek broader electoral appeal. Internal structures vary too: some parties have strong leadership control over candidate selection, others preserve a role for grassroots membership. Recent decades have seen declining membership for the major British parties, greater centralisation of campaign resources, and the rise of factionalism and personality politics. Funding and transparency are crucial, because money buys campaigning capacity and access. The regulation of party finance by the Electoral Commission and debates about donations, short money and “cash for influence” remain recurring topics in study and in contemporary politics.

## Party systems, elections and voter behaviour
Electoral systems shape party systems and vice versa. The UK’s First Past the Post system for Westminster elections tends to favour a two-party dominant outcome and encourages strategic voting, whereas the Additional Member System used for Senedd elections produces more proportional outcomes and facilitates multi-party competition, coalition or minority governments. Understanding the link between electoral rules and party performance is essential: electoral systems influence government stability, representation of smaller parties such as Plaid Cymru or the Greens, and the opportunities for new parties to establish themselves. Voting behaviour is explained by a mix of long-term structural factors—class, region, age and ethnicity—and short-term influences such as leadership, campaign performance and salient issues. Models of voting include sociological explanations, rational choice approaches and valence theories that stress competence and competence signals. Recent developments, including partisan realignment, the impact of Brexit and media fragmentation, are important for explaining patterns of turnout, dealignment and the volatility seen in elections since 2010.

## Pressure groups: types, tactics and influence
Pressure groups cover a wide range of organisations from well-resourced insider groups such as major trade associations and professional bodies to outsider groups and single-issue campaigners. Insider groups like some business groups, unions or professional bodies typically use lobbying, committee submissions and private access to ministers to exert influence. Outsider pressure groups, including many grassroots or confrontational campaigns, deploy public demonstrations, media campaigns, direct action and judicial challenges. Success depends on a mix of factors: organisational resources, public sympathy, access points in the political system, timing, the receptiveness of policymakers and the visibility of the issue. Pressure group influence is not only about direct policy wins; it can be about shaping the agenda, reframing public debate, or altering elite perceptions. Controversial examples such as the Snowdrop campaign after Dunblane, which led to tighter gun laws, show how public pressure can produce rapid legislative change, while long-term campaigns over environmental regulation or health services show the slow, cumulative work that many groups undertake. The regulatory and ethical dimension of pressure group activity—lobbying transparency, revolving doors and campaign finance—forms a key part of evaluation for essays and debates about democratic legitimacy.

## Social movements: characteristics and contemporary examples
Social movements are more diffuse and often less formally organised than traditional pressure groups. They are typically driven by broader cultural or moral claims and may operate through networks, local chapters and online mobilisation rather than membership hierarchies. Movements can be single-issue, such as environmental activism, or broader, such as the women’s movement or Black Lives Matter. They often combine protest, civil disobedience, symbolic action and the strategic use of media to shift public opinion. The digital era transforms movement dynamics: social media accelerates mobilisation, lowers the cost of coordination and allows leaderless or horizontally organised campaigns to scale quickly. Examples relevant to contemporary study include Extinction Rebellion, which used disruptive direct action to force climate debates into public and political agendas, and #MeToo, which reframed conversations about sexual harassment internationally. When evaluating movements, consider both their tactics and the political context: some achieve legal or policy change, others mainly change norms and discourse, and some face repression or co-option.

## Interaction and impact: pluralism, elitism and democratic quality
Examining the democratic impact of parties, pressure groups and movements requires balancing claims about representation with concerns about unequal influence. Pluralist accounts argue that a multiplicity of organised interests provides choice and channels for participation, preventing state monopoly over politics. Elitist or elitist-pluralist critiques point to inequalities of resources and access that privilege business interests, wealthy donors and professional lobbyists, thereby skewing policy outcomes. In practice the picture is mixed: organised labour historically shaped social policy and the Labour party; business groups and wealthy donors can have disproportionate access; grassroots movements can force agenda changes when public opinion and media attention align. The devolved context in Wales introduces additional points of access and influence; interest groups can target Senedd committees, ministers and public consultations as well as Westminster, and this multi-level governance changes strategies and opportunities. Evaluating impact therefore requires clear criteria—policy change, agenda-setting, public opinion shifts, institutionalisation of demands—and empirical support from case studies.

## Teaching and revision focus
For classroom teaching and revision, it is useful to build knowledge through a combination of concepts, case studies and comparative perspectives. Begin with clear definitions—what a party, pressure group and social movement are—then develop detailed case studies that show different routes to influence and varying levels of success. Use the Welsh context to illustrate how devolution reshapes access points and party competition, for example by comparing Senedd electoral outcomes under the Additional Member System with Westminster results. Encourage students to link theory to evidence: apply pluralist and elitist frameworks to concrete examples, use voting models to explain results in specific elections, and trace how social movements translate protest into policy. Practice constructing balanced answers that show knowledge, interpret evidence and evaluate arguments. Regular essay practice that demands both explanation and judgement will prepare students for the AO1/AO2/AO3 demands of the specification.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on parties, pressure groups and social movements successfully means combining clear definitions, targeted evidence and explicit evaluation. Start longer answers with a concise definition of key terms and an outline of the approach you will take. For explanation questions, organise material logically and link concepts to examples promptly—refer to UK parties, specific pressure groups or a named social movement to demonstrate AO1 knowledge and AO2 application. For evaluative questions, set out criteria for success early (for example, policy outcomes, agenda-setting, public support or institutional change), weigh contrasting arguments, and use case studies to test claims about influence or democratic value. Time management is important: plan a short structure for each essay, spend longer on the parts worth more marks, and reserve time for a judgement that synthesises your analysis. Use political vocabulary precisely (terms such as insider/outsider, pluralism, party system, valence voting) and show awareness of the Welsh and multi-level context where relevant. When preparing for timed assessments, practise writing conclusions that are not merely descriptive but that clearly state which side of the argument you find more convincing and why, supported by balanced evidence. Finally, incorporate recent and diverse examples to show contemporary awareness, but ensure each example is analysed rather than simply stated.
