# US institutions: Congress, Presidency and the Supreme Court (A-level Government and Politics WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: the constitutional design and its aims
The United States Constitution created a system of separated powers and checks and balances intended to prevent concentration of authority, protect liberty and enable effective government. Power is divided horizontally between three branches—Congress (legislative), the President (executive) and the Supreme Court (judicial)—and vertically between the federal government and the states under a federal system. The framers combined a written, relatively rigid constitution with mechanisms that allow adaptation through amendment and interpretation. Understanding how each institution is structured, how it exercises its formal powers and how it interacts with the other branches is central to explaining key themes in American politics: democracy, accountability, stability, and the tensions that produce gridlock, reform or constitutional change.

## Congress: representation, lawmaking and the limits of majorities
Congress is the national legislature and is bicameral, consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House, with 435 members elected every two years from districts based on population, is designed to be responsive to public opinion and to initiate revenue legislation. The Senate, with 100 members elected for six-year staggered terms and equal representation for each state, was created to protect state interests and to act as a more deliberative chamber. The legislative process begins with bills introduced in either chamber (subject to the House’s special role on money bills), followed by committee consideration, floor debates and votes in both chambers; if versions differ, a conference committee reconciles them. Committees are the engine of Congress: standing committees, such as Appropriations and Judiciary, hold hearings, draft legislation and exert significant gatekeeping power. Leadership in each chamber—most notably the Speaker of the House—controls agenda-setting, while party whips mobilise votes.

Important features that shape congressional behaviour include the committee system, the incentives of frequent reelection (especially in the House), and the tools used to manage or obstruct legislation. The Senate’s filibuster, a parliamentary device that in practice allows a minority to require a supermajority (usually 60 votes) to end debate and proceed to a vote, is a powerful obstacle to majoritarian lawmaking and fuels the phenomenon of gridlock. Reconciliation is a budgetary process that can bypass the filibuster for certain fiscal measures, and has been used in recent decades to pass major policy items. Congress also holds the power of the purse, exercises oversight through investigations and subpoenas, and has the constitutional authority to impeach and remove federal officials, including the President; impeachment is initiated in the House and tried in the Senate, requiring a two-thirds vote for conviction. The effectiveness of Congress as a check on the executive is debated: partisanship and polarization have sometimes weakened oversight, but the institution retains formal powers—confirmation, investigations and legislation—that remain central to American governance.

## The Presidency: formal powers, persuasion and the idea of the imperial presidency
The President occupies a uniquely visible position as head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief. The Constitution grants enumerated powers: to execute the laws, command the armed forces, negotiate treaties (with Senate ratification), appoint federal officers and judges (with Senate advice and consent), veto legislation and grant pardons. Over time, presidential authority has expanded through historical practice, legislation and the demands of modern governance. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) and the Cabinet, along with numerous executive agencies, provide administrative capacity. Two competing traditions help explain presidential power: the legal-constitutional view, which emphasises the text of the Constitution and enumerated powers, and the stewardship or prerogative view, which sees the President as authorised to act in the national interest unless explicitly prohibited.

Scholars and commentators use terms such as the “imperial presidency” to describe moments when presidents exercise extensive unilateral authority, especially in foreign policy and national security. Modern presidents often use executive orders, signing statements and administrative rulemaking to shape policy without new legislation. Yet presidential power is largely persuasive: the ability to persuade Congress, courts, foreign leaders and public opinion is crucial. The President faces constitutional constraints—Congress controls budgets and legislation, the Senate confirms appointments, and the courts can review executive actions. Recent examples demonstrate these dynamics: presidents have sought to advance policy through executive action when faced with congressional opposition, and the Supreme Court has curtailed or validated executive initiatives in key cases. The balance between presidential initiative and institutional constraint is a central theme for evaluating the office’s effectiveness and democratic legitimacy.

## The Supreme Court: judicial review, precedent and constitutional interpretation
The Supreme Court is the apex of the federal judiciary and plays a defining role in interpreting the Constitution and federal law. The Court’s authority to review and, where necessary, invalidate acts of Congress or executive action that clash with the Constitution was asserted in Marbury v. Madison (1803), establishing the principle of judicial review. The Court’s decisions are binding across the land and can have profound social and political consequences, from desegregation in Brown v. Board of Education to modern rulings on campaign finance and reproductive rights.

Justices are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and they hold lifetime tenure (subject to good behaviour), which insulates them from short-term political pressures and makes the composition of the Court a matter of enduring consequence. The Court controls its docket largely through the certiorari process, selecting which cases to hear, and applies doctrines such as stare decisis (respect for precedent), although the Court sometimes overturns earlier decisions. Approaches to interpretation range from strict constructionism and originalism, which emphasise the Constitution’s original meaning, to the living constitution approach, which allows for evolving interpretation in light of contemporary conditions. Debates about judicial activism versus restraint focus on the appropriateness and limits of judicial policy-making, and the increasing ideological polarisation surrounding confirmations has made the Court an overtly political battleground. Landmark cases such as McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) clarified federal supremacy and implied powers, creating legal foundations for a strong national government, while more recent decisions on campaign finance, executive power and civil liberties continue to shape the balance between branches and the protection of rights.

## Interaction and checks: how the branches constrain and enable one another
The U.S. system is defined by mutual checks and interactions. Congress can check the President by overriding vetoes, refusing to fund initiatives, using oversight hearings and, in extreme cases, impeaching and removing officials. The Senate’s advice-and-consent role significantly shapes the federal judiciary and the executive branch’s personnel. The President can veto legislation, issue executive orders and, as commander-in-chief, shape foreign and military policy. The judiciary can strike down laws or executive actions as unconstitutional, but it relies on the other branches and public institutions to enforce its decisions. Political parties and public opinion often blur formal separations: a unified government (when one party controls both Congress and the Presidency) can make the separation of powers less constraining in practice, while divided government tends to increase bargaining, use of unilateral tools and, at times, gridlock.

These interactions produce both strengths and weaknesses. The system resists sudden abuses of power and can protect minorities of opinion, but it can also produce stalemate, especially in times of intense partisan polarisation. Real-world examples illustrate these dynamics: legislative deadlock has led presidents to act through executive orders, while congressional investigations have checked executive excesses. Judicial review can protect civil liberties, yet the politicisation of confirmation battles raises questions about the Court’s perceived legitimacy.

## Contemporary pressures and examples
In recent decades several trends have highlighted pressures on the constitutional system. Polarisation has increased the frequency and intensity of Senate confirmation fights and has made the filibuster a central issue in legislative strategy. Campaign finance developments, most notably the decision permitting political spending by corporations and unions, have altered the electoral landscape and heightened debates about money in politics. The expansion of the administrative state and the complexity of modern governance have increased the role of executive agencies, prompting disputes over agency rulemaking, the “unitary executive” theory and congressional oversight. High-profile litigation has tested the boundaries of executive authority on issues such as immigration, national security and the scope of administrative power. The Court itself has issued decisions that reshape policy outcomes, prompting public debate about judicial activism and the permanence of precedent. For students, connecting institutional powers to concrete episodes—such as how a landmark ruling reshaped policy or how an impeachment trial played out—helps to illustrate how constitutional theory becomes practical politics.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Congress, the Presidency and the Supreme Court, begin by carefully unpacking the question’s stem and command words. Use the first paragraph to define terms concisely and to outline your line of argument so the examiner sees your focus. Balance AO1 knowledge (institutional structure and powers) with AO2 application (use precise examples and recent cases) and AO3 evaluation (analytical judgement). In the main body, structure paragraphs so that each begins with a clear point, follows with evidence or an example—such as a specific Supreme Court case, a presidential action or a congressional procedure—and explains its significance for the question. Where appropriate, compare institutions or time periods to show understanding of change and continuity. For evaluation, weigh strengths and weaknesses, consider counterarguments, and assess relevance: for example, explain when the filibuster protects minority rights and when it produces harmful gridlock. Conclude with a succinct judgment that directly answers the question and summarises the key reasons for your view. Time management is crucial: allocate time to plan, write and proofread, and aim to include at least two substantive examples per extended-response question to secure the higher AO3 marks.
