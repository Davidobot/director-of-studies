# Legal professions and the judiciary (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: why the professions and judiciary matter
The legal professions and the judiciary are the people who make the law work in practice. Lawyers create legal arguments, advise clients, prepare cases and present them in court; judges and magistrates decide disputes, interpret statutes and develop the law through their judgments. For A-level students, understanding who does what, how they are trained and regulated, and the constitutional safeguards around the judiciary is essential because these features determine how justice is delivered, how precedent is formed and how access to the legal system is organised. This topic connects directly to the rule of law, separation of powers and themes such as fairness, independence and access to justice.

## The roles of solicitors and barristers
Historically the legal profession in England and Wales has been split between solicitors and barristers. Solicitors deal directly with clients, conduct most of the day-to-day legal work, prepare documents, provide advice and, where necessary, instruct barristers to appear in higher courts. Barristers specialise in advocacy and court work, advising on points of law and representing clients in contested hearings. Over recent years the practical distinction has softened. Solicitors can now acquire higher rights of audience and act as advocates in higher courts once they have undergone specialist training, while many companies and public bodies employ in-house lawyers who perform the roles traditionally associated with solicitors. The difference remains important for A-level study because the professional roles shape access to courts, the development of specialist advocacy skills and the routes through which legal advice reaches citizens.

## Legal executives, paralegals and other support roles
Alongside solicitors and barristers there are other qualified lawyers such as chartered legal executives and a wide range of paralegals who perform essential legal work. Chartered legal executives are members of CILEX and follow a vocational training route which can lead to specialist practice and, in some cases, judicial appointment. Paralegals work in private practice, in-house teams and the public sector carrying out research, document preparation and client work under supervision. These roles are increasingly significant in a market that needs cost-effective legal services and where large firms and organisations delegate routine and specialist tasks. Understanding these roles helps explain the practical delivery of legal services and why some disputes never reach court.

## Training, qualification and regulation
The routes into the professions and the bodies that regulate them are central to the study of the legal system. Solicitors now qualify by passing the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE), a centralised assessment introduced to standardise entry to the profession; historically the Legal Practice Course (LPC) and a period of supervised practice were the route. Aspiring barristers complete academic study, vocational bar training and a period of pupillage before full practise; the names and formats of vocational courses have evolved, but the core requirement of pupillage remains. Chartered legal executives train through CILEX and can achieve equivalent status through a combination of exams and work-based experience. Regulation is carried out by independent regulatory bodies: the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) regulates solicitors, the Bar Standards Board (BSB) regulates barristers, and CILEX Regulation covers legal executives. These regulators set entry standards, issue practising rules, and handle professional discipline, balancing consumer protection with professional independence.

## The hierarchy of courts and judicial roles
The judiciary is organised in a clear hierarchy that affects the binding force of decisions and the routes of appeal. At the bottom are magistrates’ courts and county courts which handle the bulk of criminal summary cases and lower-value civil disputes. The Crown Court deals with serious criminal trials and sentencing; the High Court hears important civil claims and is organised into divisions such as Queen’s Bench and Chancery (names may change in line with constitutional adjustments but their functions persist). Above the High Court sits the Court of Appeal, divided into Criminal and Civil Divisions, which binds lower courts and shapes the law through authoritative rulings. The Supreme Court is the final appellate court in the United Kingdom and replaced the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords in 2009; its decisions are binding on all lower courts. Judges at each level perform different judicial functions: trial judges manage proceedings and decide facts in jury or bench trials, while appellate judges focus on points of law and the correct application of legal principles.

## How judges are appointed and why independence matters
Judicial appointment in England and Wales is designed to combine merit selection with safeguards for independence and public confidence. The Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC), established in the mid-2000s, advertises vacancies, assesses candidates and recommends appointments on merit. Candidates must meet eligibility criteria, which include a period of legal experience or prior judicial service. Once appointed, judges enjoy security of tenure, fixed remuneration and immunity from suit for acts done in judgment, all of which protect judicial independence. Independence is fundamental because judges must be able to apply the law impartially, free from political pressure or improper influence. At the same time, mechanisms exist to ensure accountability: the judicial conduct investigation office handles complaints about judicial behaviour, and the rare process for removal of a senior judge requires an address from both Houses of Parliament to the monarch. These features reflect the constitutional balance between independence, accountability and the rule of law.

## Magistrates, district judges and the lay contribution to justice
Magistrates, often called justices of the peace, are lay volunteers who handle a very large volume of criminal cases and some family and civil matters. They are unpaid, receive training and sit in benches of two or three with a legally qualified advisor, and they exercise sentencing powers within statutory limits. The magistracy reflects the principle that participation by ordinary citizens is an important aspect of the justice system, but it also raises questions about consistency, training and representativeness. District judges (formerly known as stipendiary magistrates in the magistrates’ courts) are legally qualified full-time judges who deal with more complex cases and sit alone. In the civil courts, district judges (also called district judges of the county court) manage small claims and county court business. The interaction between lay and professional judges is an important study point because it showcases different sources of judicial legitimacy and practical approaches to case management.

## The professions, the judiciary and access to justice
The structure and costs of legal services and court funding have a direct effect on access to justice. Legal aid, which historically funded many criminal and civil cases, has been constrained by policy changes and budgetary pressures, meaning more people rely on pro bono advice, limited-scope services from solicitors, conditional fee agreements and alternative dispute resolution to resolve disputes. Conditional fee agreements and damages-based agreements are mechanisms that have adjusted how civil cases are funded since reforms in the last decade. The professions respond to these changes by offering unbundled services, using paralegals for cost control and developing in-house legal departments. The judiciary also plays a role in access to justice: case management powers, promotion of less adversarial processes and encouragement of mediation are judicial responses designed to reduce delay and cost. Studying these interactions explains how practical constraints and policy affect the delivery of legal remedies and why the composition and regulation of the professions matter beyond questions of prestige or tradition.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on legal professions and the judiciary, begin by defining key terms such as “judicial independence”, “right of audience”, or “magistrate” and briefly set out the legal framework relevant to the question. Apply the law to the scenario using the IRAC approach: identify the issue, state the relevant legal rule or principle, apply it to the facts and reach a reasoned conclusion. For AO1 marks demonstrate clear, accurate knowledge of roles, training routes and court structure. For AO2 focus on applying that knowledge to the factual situation: explain how, for example, a solicitor would act differently to a barrister in preparing a case, or how a court hierarchy affects the likelihood of an appeal succeeding. For AO3 show evaluation by considering the strengths and weaknesses of the current arrangements: discuss issues such as delays, funding pressures, diversity in appointments or tensions between independence and accountability and suggest possible reforms or alternatives. Use legal terminology appropriately, refer to recent changes where relevant (for example to training routes or the replacement of the House of Lords with the Supreme Court), and structure your answer in clear paragraphs so examiners can follow your reasoning. Conclude with a succinct final judgment that links back to the question and balances the arguments you have presented.
