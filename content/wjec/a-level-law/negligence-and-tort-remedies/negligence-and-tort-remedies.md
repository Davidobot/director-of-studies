# Negligence and tort remedies (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction and purpose of the tort of negligence
Negligence is the central tort for dealing with civil wrongs caused by carelessness. At its heart, negligence asks whether a defendant owed a claimant a legally recognisable duty to take care, whether that duty was breached, and whether the breach caused the kind of loss the law will compensate. The law of negligence protects people and property from unreasonable risk and provides a framework for allocating responsibility and compensation when accidents occur. In studying negligence you will meet key policy debates about fault versus strict liability, corrective and distributive justice, and criticisms of the tort system such as complexity and expense. These debates help when you evaluate whether the law achieves fair outcomes and when you discuss reform.

## Theories and structure of the law of tort
The law of tort is not a single unified code but a collection of duties developed by judges and legislators to address different kinds of wrongs. Negligence sits alongside other torts and is founded on the notion of fault: the defendant’s conduct fell below the standard the law expects. Theories that justify negligence include corrective justice — restoring the claimant as far as possible to the position they would have been in but for the defendant’s wrong — and economic arguments that place costs on those who create risks. Retributive ideas have less prominence in negligence than in criminal law, but the system also faces criticisms: it can be slow, costly and sometimes produces inconsistent results. Knowing these theoretical ideas helps you evaluate the law in essays and in longer questions.

## Duty of care: neighbour principle and the Caparo test
The neighbour principle, established in the landmark case Donoghue v Stevenson, is the foundation of modern negligence: you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions likely to injure those so closely and directly affected by your conduct that you ought to have them in mind as “neighbours.” That open-ended principle is refined by the three-stage test from Caparo v Dickman, which is the practical formula you will apply to novel situations. Caparo asks whether harm was reasonably foreseeable, whether there was sufficient proximity between claimant and defendant, and whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty. Applying Caparo requires sensitivity to context: courts are cautious about creating novel duties where imposing liability would have wide social or economic consequences. Typical examples where duty is straightforward include road users, employers to employees and manufacturers to consumers, but more complex commercial or policy-laden situations require careful Caparo analysis.

## Breach of duty and the standard of care
Once a duty exists, the question becomes whether the defendant breached it. The general standard is objective: how would a reasonable person in the defendant’s position have acted? Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks illustrates this objective test by contrasting reasonable precaution with negligence. The courts consider a range of factors when judging breach: the likelihood of harm, the seriousness of potential damage, the practicality and cost of precautions, and social utility. The leading authorities show how these factors operate. In Bolton v Stone the court found no breach where the risk was very small and precautions were disproportionate, while in Paris v Stepney Borough Council the seriousness of harm to an individual (a one-eyed employee) justified greater precautions.

Different defendants attract tailored standards. Professionals are judged against the standard of a reasonably competent member of that profession. The Bolam principle (and its modern developments in medical law) means that if a responsible body of professional opinion would have acted as the defendant did, there is usually no breach. Learners and children are judged against the standard of a reasonable person with the same characteristics; for example, a child’s conduct is compared to a reasonable child of similar age. Cases such as Nettleship v Weston, where a learner driver was held to the standard of a competent driver, show the law’s tendency to maintain consistent standards even when the defendant lacks experience.

## Causation and remoteness of damage
Causation requires both factual and legal links between breach and loss. The factual link uses the “but for” test: but for the defendant’s breach, would the harm have occurred? Barnett v Chelsea & Kensington Hospital illustrates the “but for” test: where a hospital’s breach did not in fact cause the death, there was no liability. Legal causation asks whether the defendant’s breach is a proximate cause and whether any intervening act (novus actus interveniens) breaks the chain of causation. Cases such as Knightley v Johns and McKew v Holland show scenarios where intervening acts by third parties or by the claimant can sever liability.

Remoteness limits liability to losses of a type that were reasonably foreseeable at the time of breach. The Wagon Mound decision famously held that a defendant is only liable for the sort of damage that was a foreseeable consequence of their conduct. The “thin skull” or “eggshell skull” rule, however, means the defendant takes the claimant as found: if foreseeable physical injury is caused, the defendant is liable for the full extent of harm even if the claimant’s pre-existing vulnerability makes the injury worse, as in Smith v Leech Brain. These principles require careful application: you must distinguish between the type of loss and the extent of it, and consider foreseeability at the time of the breach.

## Psychiatric injury and special causation rules
Claims for psychiatric injury (nervous shock) are treated with particular caution. The law distinguishes primary victims — those directly involved in an incident and at risk of physical harm — from secondary victims — witnesses or bystanders who suffer psychiatric harm as a result of witnessing injury to others. Primary victims may recover where psychiatric harm is foreseeable, as in Page v Smith, while secondary victims face stricter criteria developed in Alcock: proximity of relationship to the victim, proximity in time and space to the event, and direct perception of the event rather than hearing about it second-hand. These requirements aim to control the scope of liability, but they also spark debate about fairness, particularly where family members suffer predictable psychiatric damage.

## Occupiers’ liability
Occupiers’ liability deals with the duty owed by those who occupy or control premises to visitors and trespassers. The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 imposes a duty of care to lawful visitors to ensure reasonably safe premises for the purposes for which they are invited. The courts assess who is an occupier (Wheat v E Lacon) and consider special rules for children — occupiers must anticipate that children may not appreciate risks, so the duty is higher in some contexts (Glasgow Corporation v Taylor). The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 addresses the position of trespassers, creating a more limited duty where the occupier is aware of the danger and of the presence (or likely presence) of trespassers and the risk is one against which the occupier can be expected to offer protection. A key historical turning point was Herrington v British Railways Board, which led to recognition of greater duty towards trespassers and influenced the 1984 Act. Practical examples — a slipped customer in a shop, or an injured trespasser on derelict premises — require you to identify the status of the visitor and apply the relevant statutory tests.

## Remedies: damages, mitigation and injunctions
The primary remedy in negligence is compensatory damages, intended to put the claimant in the position they would have been in but for the defendant’s wrong. Damages are divided into general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity, and special damages to cover past financial losses and expenses. The claimant has a duty to mitigate loss by taking reasonable steps to reduce their damage; the principle is illustrated in cases such as British Westinghouse, where a failure to mitigate may reduce recoverable damages. The law also recognises nominal damages where a legal right is infringed without substantial loss, and exemplary damages in rare cases to punish particularly egregious conduct.

Equitable remedies, especially injunctions, offer more than money. A prohibitory injunction restrains someone from doing something (for example, preventing ongoing nuisance), while a mandatory injunction requires a defendant to take positive action (for example, to remove a dangerous structure). Courts are cautious about granting mandatory relief and will weigh proportionality and the adequacy of damages. When assessing remedies, you must argue why damages would be sufficient or why an injunction is justified, considering the claimant’s needs and the practical effect on both parties.

## Practical approach to applying the law
In problem questions begin by identifying the relevant tort and the parties’ legal relationship. For negligence proceed methodically: establish a duty of care (use Donoghue/Caparo), explain whether breach occurred by reference to the reasonable person and risk factors, then tackle causation and remoteness, and finally consider any defences such as contributory negligence or consent. When occupiers’ liability is at issue, identify the visitor’s status and apply the 1957 or 1984 Act accordingly. Where remedies are required, explain the types of available relief and justify the appropriate remedy. Always include relevant case law to support each point and apply the legal tests to the facts with clarity. Balanced evaluation — discussing policy implications or shortcomings of the law — will score marks in essay-style and synoptic questions.

## Exam technique
Answering negligence questions effectively requires structure, precision and targeted use of authority. For problem questions allocate time to plan: identify the issues, outline the relevant legal tests, and apply the tests paragraph by paragraph to the facts. Use case names succinctly — Donoghue v Stevenson to establish principle, Caparo for new duties, Barnett for factual causation, Wagon Mound for remoteness — and explain their legal points rather than retelling long facts. In evaluation and essay questions show awareness of competing policies: access to justice, deterrence, and proportionality of imposing duties. Always link your evaluation back to the law’s aims and to realistic consequences for claimants, defendants and wider society. Keep answers tailored to the question, avoid unnecessary generalisation, and conclude with a clear, justified judgment on liability and remedy.
