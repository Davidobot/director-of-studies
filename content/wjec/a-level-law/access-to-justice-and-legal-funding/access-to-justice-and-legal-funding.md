# Access to justice and legal funding (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: why access to justice matters
Access to justice is the idea that everyone should be able to seek and obtain a fair outcome through the legal system when their rights are affected or obligations arise. It is central to the rule of law: without meaningful access to legal advice, representation and courts or tribunals, rights may exist on paper but be illusory in practice. Legal funding – the ways cases are paid for – sits at the heart of access to justice. Whether a person can afford a solicitor, qualify for legal aid, rely on insurance or use alternative dispute resolution will often determine whether a dispute is resolved, how it is resolved and whether the outcome is fair. For A‑level study this topic requires you to understand not only the technical rules about eligibility and funding mechanisms, but also the policy tensions: fairness versus cost, individual rights versus public expenditure, and national policy choices which affect how people in Wales and England can enforce their rights.

## Legal aid: principles, structure and tests
Legal aid is state-funded assistance for those who cannot afford legal help. In England and Wales this assistance is administered through the Legal Aid Agency and is governed by statutory rules and regulations. Two fundamental gates control access to legal aid: means testing and merit testing. Means testing looks at a person’s income and capital to determine whether they can reasonably pay for advice and representation themselves; merit testing examines whether the case has reasonable prospects of success or whether it is in the public interest to fund it. In criminal cases a related but different test operates: the “interests of justice” threshold that considers factors such as the seriousness of the offence, the complexity of issues, and whether the defendant would face imprisonment if convicted. Historically the legal aid system expanded after the Second World War as part of building an inclusive welfare state, but later reforms sought to control public costs and to focus funding on the most serious or vulnerable cases.

## Civil legal aid: scope and the impact of reform
Civil legal aid used to cover a broad range of problems, including welfare benefits, debt, housing, family disputes and employment. Major reforms introduced in recent decades, most notably the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, reduced the scope of civil legal aid. Many areas that affect everyday life—such as most debt problems, employment and some welfare benefit appeals—now fall outside funded civil legal aid, although exemptions remain for certain categories like some family cases involving domestic violence and matters that engage human rights. In civil matters the means and merits tests are strictly applied. A claimant with low income may still be turned down if the case has little prospect of success or is not considered a suitable use of public funds. The result has been an increase in litigants in person—individuals representing themselves in court—placing pressure on courts and often causing poorer outcomes for those without legal assistance. To mitigate this gap, non‑statutory services such as law centres, pro bono schemes and advice agencies play an important role by offering limited or free help, while alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and mediation offer routes that can be cheaper and faster than litigation where both sides are willing to use them.

## Criminal legal aid and public defender services
Criminal legal aid remains an essential safeguard for the accused. At police stations and in court, duty solicitors and privately contracted firms provide compulsory and representation for defendants who pass the interests of justice test and, in many cases, the means test. The concept of a public defender—state employed lawyers providing criminal defence services—has been discussed and piloted in some areas as an alternative to a market of private defence firms. A public defender model aims to ensure continuity, reduce conflicts of interest and provide a direct publicly funded service, but it raises questions about independence, quality control and cost. In practice the Legal Aid Agency ensures that those who are eligible for criminal legal aid receive representation, including at appeal stages where legal complexity or the prospect of custody requires professional help. The availability of experienced advocates for serious trials is crucial to the fairness of the criminal justice system.

## Other funding methods: conditional fees, insurance and pro bono work
Outside legal aid, several funding methods exist. Conditional fee agreements (CFAs), commonly known as “no win, no fee” arrangements, allow a client to instruct a lawyer on the basis that the lawyer will receive a success fee if the case succeeds. Historically claimants could recover success fees and after‑the‑event (ATE) insurance premiums from the losing party, but reforms changed the recoverability rules so that success fees and most ATE premiums are no longer recoverable in many civil claims. Legal expenses insurance, which can be purchased as a standalone policy or as part of household insurance, covers legal costs in certain disputes and is an active way of spreading risk. Trade unions and professional associations also provide legal assistance to their members in some matters. Pro bono work by law firms and barristers, along with university legal clinics and advice charities, helps fill gaps left by statutory cuts but cannot match the scale of public funding. Conditional arrangements and insurance have helped some claimants pursue civil claims, especially personal injury cases, but they come with limitations, such as restricted availability and potential costs to successful claimants.

## Barriers to access and consequences for justice
Funding is not the only barrier to access; geography, complexity and the behaviour of institutions also matter. Rural communities in Wales and remote parts of England face shortages of solicitors and longer travel times to courts. Court closures and the centralisation of some services have reduced face‑to‑face access in some areas. Complex procedures and legal language can deter people, especially where free advice is not readily available. The cumulative effect of funding restrictions and practical barriers is to undermine equality before the law: people with means obtain representation and better outcomes, while those on low incomes face procedural disadvantages. There are broader consequences too: increased numbers of unrepresented parties slow down hearings and demand more judicial time, while the erosion of publicly funded legal advice contributes to social problems by leaving issues such as housing disrepair or welfare entitlement unresolved until they escalate.

## The Welsh perspective and policy developments
Wales has a distinctive context within the UK. Legal aid is a reserved matter, so the main rules about eligibility and scope are set for England and Wales together. However, devolved public services, rural settlement patterns and local commissioning of advice services mean the practical effects of funding decisions can differ across Wales. The Welsh Government can influence access by funding independent advice services, supporting law clinics and promoting legal awareness campaigns, but it cannot unilaterally restore civil legal aid for areas removed by national legislation. Recent policy debates have focused on whether the state should reinvest in early legal advice, reform recoverability rules, or create new public defender structures for criminal work. Any reform proposals must balance the cost to the public purse with the constitutional and moral case for ensuring effective access to justice across both urban and rural communities in Wales.

## Illustrative scenarios: how funding rules work in practice
Consider a low‑income tenant in Wales facing eviction for rent arrears. Prior to recent reforms, this tenant might have been eligible for civil legal aid to defend possession proceedings. Today, whether legal aid is available depends on the specific legal issues involved and whether the case falls within the narrow categories that remain funded, such as where human rights or homelessness duties are engaged. Even if the tenant passes the means test, merit considerations about the prospect of success and public funding priorities can affect the outcome. In a criminal context, imagine a defendant arrested on a serious charge who is denied representation because they do not meet the means test. The interests of justice criteria are designed to prevent that happening: if the case is complex, likely to result in imprisonment, or the defendant cannot understand the proceedings, legal aid should be granted irrespective of means. In civil claims for personal injury, a claimant may use a conditional fee agreement to instruct a solicitor; under current rules, the claimant may be liable to pay the solicitors’ success fee out of their damages if the case succeeds, which can reduce the net recovery and should be considered when deciding whether to pursue a claim.

## Balancing principles: efficiency, fairness and the limits of funding
Policy choices about legal funding reflect competing values. Funding everything would promote equality but would be costly for the taxpayer. Restricting funding saves money but raises issues of fairness and potentially leaves vulnerable people unable to enforce basic rights. Economists and legal scholars debate whether funding early advice is more cost‑effective than later litigation, and whether investment in community legal services reduces long‑term public expenditure by preventing disputes from escalating. For students, it is useful to weigh arguments on both sides: consider the public interest in preventing injustice and social harm, alongside legitimate pressures to prioritise limited resources. Understanding these tensions helps when you evaluate how well the law achieves justice and when you construct balanced answers in exams.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on access to justice and legal funding, start by identifying which area the question targets: civil funding, criminal funding, or comparative funding methods. For AO1, give clear definitions and explain the legal tests (means test, merits test, interests of justice) and the role of the Legal Aid Agency. For AO2, apply the law to the given facts: show how a hypothetical claimant’s income, case merits and the type of dispute determine eligibility. Use realistic examples to illustrate outcomes, such as how a personal injury claimant might use a conditional fee agreement, or how a defendant’s right to representation is protected by the interests of justice test. For AO3, evaluate the effectiveness of the funding regime: assess arguments about fairness, cost, deterrence, and the social consequences of cuts to legal aid. Balance criticism with acknowledgement of resource limits and suggest reforms or alternatives, such as expanded pro bono provision, stronger early‑advice schemes, or targeted public defender models. Structure your answer with a brief introduction, clear analytical paragraphs each addressing a specific point, and a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Use appropriate legal terminology, demonstrate awareness of the Welsh context where relevant, and manage your time so you can include both application and evaluation within the mark scheme requirements.
