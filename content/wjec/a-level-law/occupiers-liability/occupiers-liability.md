# Occupiers' liability (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## Legal framework and key concepts

Occupiers’ liability concerns the responsibility of the person or people who have control of premises for the safety of those who come onto those premises. The modern framework in England and Wales is statutory. The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 (OLA 1957) governs the duty owed to lawful visitors, while the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 (OLA 1984) creates a limited duty to certain people who are not lawful visitors (commonly described as trespassers). Understanding occupiers’ liability starts with defining who counts as an occupier and what counts as premises. The leading authority on the meaning of “occupier” is Wheat v Lacon: being an occupier depends on control of the premises rather than formal ownership; more than one person can be an occupier if they share control. “Premises” is construed broadly to include buildings, land and fixed or movable structures. These definitions set the stage for asking three core questions in any occupiers’ liability problem: who is the occupier, what category of entrant is the claimant, and what duty (if any) is owed?

## Duty to lawful visitors under the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957

Under the OLA 1957 an occupier owes a duty to lawful visitors to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe while using the premises for the purposes for which they are invited or permitted to be there. Lawful visitors include invitees, licensees and anyone with express or implied permission to be on the premises, such as customers in a shop or a social guest in a house. The statutory duty is not absolute: it is qualified by what is reasonable in the circumstances, and this invites a familiar negligence-style analysis of breach and causation.

When applying the statutory duty, the courts look at the standard of care expected of the occupier, judged objectively. Cases such as Laverton v Kiapasha Tandoori Restaurant and others show that occupiers are not required to eliminate all risk, only to take reasonable steps to ensure safety. The measure of reasonable steps will depend on factors such as the nature of the premises, the practicality of precautions, the likelihood and seriousness of harm and the cost and practicability of prevention.

## Special rules for children, warnings and the effectiveness of precautions

The OLA 1957 recognises special considerations for child visitors. Occupiers must be prepared for children “to be less careful than adults” and the courts apply a higher level of care where children are concerned. If a danger is likely to attract children because of its nature—an “allurement”—an occupier may need to take extra precautions. In Glasgow Corporation v Taylor a children’s death after eating poisonous berries led the court to emphasise that certain hazards are particularly attractive to children, and occupiers must guard against them. By contrast, Phipps v Rochester Corporation illustrates that the courts will not make occupiers insurers of very young children where parents or guardians could reasonably provide supervision.

Warnings can sometimes discharge or reduce the occupier’s duty, but a warning must be adequate in content and delivery to be effective. A clear, specific warning that draws attention to the nature and degree of the danger may protect an occupier where the visitor is otherwise able to appreciate and avoid the risk. However, warnings will not suffice where the danger is one that a warning cannot reasonably overcome (for example, a hidden trap that a child cannot appreciate). Roles v Nathan is helpful where the court allowed reliance on the skill and knowledge of specialists who were warned of a risk; for ordinary visitors the test remains whether the warning made the visitor reasonably safe.

## Independent contractors and the reasonable steps test

It is important to recognise that occupiers are not automatically liable for everything that goes wrong on their premises. Where an occupier entrusts work to an independent contractor, the occupier may escape liability if it was reasonable to entrust the task to a competent contractor and if the occupier took reasonable steps to ensure the work was properly done. The courts distinguish between work that requires specialist technical skill and simpler tasks. In Haseldine v Daw the occupier was not liable for a lift failure because maintenance work required technical expertise and had been entrusted to a competent firm. Where, however, the work is of a kind the occupier could reasonably be expected to supervise, or where the occupier fails to take obvious steps to check that work has been done correctly, liability may remain. The practical point for students is to identify whether an occupier has taken reasonable precautions in hiring and checking contractors and to apply relevant authority.

## Liability to trespassers under the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984

The OLA 1984 fills a gap left by the 1957 Act: it creates a limited duty of care to persons who are not lawful visitors, such as trespassers, but only in narrowly defined circumstances. The statute requires that the occupier be aware of a danger, have reasonable grounds to believe that a non-visitor is, or may be, in the vicinity of that danger, and have reasonable grounds to think that the risk is one against which he ought to offer protection. Only where these conditions are met does the occupier owe a duty “to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances” to see that the non-visitor does not suffer injury.

The House of Lords in Tomlinson v Congleton Borough Council illustrated the restrictive approach courts will adopt when applying the 1984 Act. In that case a man injured after diving into a lake on council land was denied compensation because the council had not created the danger and had adequately warned against the obvious risk. Similarly, Ratcliff v McConnell, where a trespasser dived into a closed and clearly signed university swimming pool, shows that courts will be reluctant to impose liability where an adult voluntarily accepts an obvious risk. The 1984 Act therefore provides protection only in limited scenarios, for example where an occupier knows children are likely to trespass into a dangerous area created or left in a hazardous condition and has not taken reasonable steps to prevent access or warn effectively.

## Breach, causation, defences and remedies

Once duty is established, breach is assessed by asking whether the occupier’s conduct fell below the standard of a reasonably careful occupier in the circumstances. This analysis draws heavily on negligence principles: foreseeability of harm, likelihood of injury, seriousness of potential harm and the burden of precautions. Causation and remoteness follow the familiar “but for” test and notions of reasonable foreseeability. Defences that often arise include contributory negligence—when the claimant’s own carelessness contributes to the harm—and volenti non fit injuria (consent), especially relevant where an adult knowingly accepts an obvious risk. Warnings and obvious risks form important aspects of the volenti defence; effective warnings may reduce or defeat a claim.

Remedies are primarily compensatory damages intended to return the claimant to the position they would have been in but for the accident. Injunctions are rarely relevant in occupiers’ liability claims, but equitable relief may arise in cases where continuing danger must be eliminated. Students should remember to discuss the effect of contributory negligence in reducing damages and to consider whether any statutory or common law limit applies to loss claimed.

## Policy, criticism and interaction with other areas of law

Occupiers’ liability sits at the intersection of private law’s duty to protect visitors and wider policy questions about personal responsibility, public access and landowner autonomy. The 1957 Act reflects a balance between protecting visitors and not unduly burdening occupiers with liability. The 1984 Act was intended to provide some protection for non-visitors but has been criticised for its limited scope and the courts’ cautious approach in extending duties to trespassers. There is also an interaction with criminal law (for example, where trespass becomes an offence) and with public law when public authorities manage open spaces. In exam answers it is useful to show critical awareness: for instance, consider whether the law strikes the right balance between encouraging landowners to make places safe and preserving individual autonomy by not compensating those who willingly accept hazards.

## Applying the law to scenarios — practical examples

Consider a supermarket customer who slips on a puddle. Under the OLA 1957 the supermarket is an occupier and the customer is a lawful visitor. The court will ask whether the store took reasonable steps to inspect and keep the floor safe, whether the spill should have been noticed in the circumstances, and whether warning signs were placed promptly. Contrast that with a teenager who climbs a fence to swim in a locked leisure-centre pool and is injured. Here the OLA 1984 and cases like Ratcliff and Tomlinson suggest the occupier’s duty will be limited and an effective warning and locked gate will often be sufficient to negate liability. For children drawn to playground equipment or objects left on site, the “allurement” concept can be decisive; an occupier must anticipate that children may be less careful and take extra precautions or provide adequate supervision.

## Exam technique

When answering problem questions on occupiers’ liability, follow a clear structure: start by identifying the parties and the facts relevant to control of the premises. Define who the occupier is and whether the claimant is a lawful visitor or a non-visitor. State the statutory duty that applies (OLA 1957 for lawful visitors; OLA 1984 for certain non-visitors) and outline the legal tests in statutory language before applying them to the facts. For duty under the 1957 Act, quote the principle that the occupier must take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure visitor safety; for the 1984 Act, set out the threshold conditions (awareness of danger, knowledge or reasonable belief of possible presence, and that the risk is one against which protection should be afforded). Apply leading cases to each issue, using them to support your analysis: Wheat v Lacon for occupier status, Haseldine for independent contractors, Roles v Nathan for warnings to specialists and Jolly or Glasgow Corporation cases for child allurement; use Tomlinson and Ratcliff when discussing trespassers. Move from law to application and conclude with a balanced evaluation where appropriate — for example, whether the occupier acted reasonably or whether policy considerations suggest a different outcome. Remember to address breach, causation and any available defences, and to state the likely remedy. Organise your answer with clear paragraphs, use legal terminology accurately, and aim to demonstrate knowledge (AO1), apply it to the facts (AO2) and evaluate the law or its application where relevant (AO3).
