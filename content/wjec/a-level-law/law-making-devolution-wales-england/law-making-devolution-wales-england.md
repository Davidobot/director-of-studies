# Law making and devolution (Wales & England) (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of law making in Wales and England
Law in Wales and England is produced through a mixture of primary legislation, delegated legislation and judge-made law. At the core of the UK constitution sits Parliamentary sovereignty: the UK Parliament can make or unmake any law and no Parliament can bind a later Parliament. This constitutional background operates alongside the separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, and alongside principles such as the rule of law which require that government acts within the law and that individuals have access to legal remedies when rights are infringed. For students, it is helpful to see law making as a practical conversation between different institutions: Parliament and, for devolved matters, the Welsh legislature; government ministers who draft much law and use delegated powers; judges who develop and interpret the law; and independent bodies that recommend reform. Understanding how these pieces fit together prepares you to explain not only how a particular rule exists but why it is framed the way it is.

## Parliamentary law‑making in the UK
The passage of Acts of Parliament remains the most significant source of primary legislation. The legislative process starts with a draft Bill, usually prepared by government lawyers and ministers, and passes through several stages in both Houses: First Reading, Second Reading, Committee Stage, Report Stage and Third Reading, followed by the other House and finally Royal Assent. Students should be able to describe these stages and explain their practical purpose: policy scrutiny, amendment and public and parliamentary debate. Parliament’s supremacy means that statutes override previous judge-made law, but Parliament may also set out frameworks that delegate detail-making powers to the executive. The Royal Prerogative still gives the government certain residual powers, such as conduct of foreign affairs and the making of Orders in Council, but the exercise of many prerogative powers is now subject to parliamentary and judicial control. It is also useful to contrast the theoretical idea of Parliamentary sovereignty with practical realities: political convention, the influence of the executive when it controls the legislative timetable, and judicial review which checks whether ministers act within powers conferred by Parliament.

## The Devolution Settlement in Wales and the role of the Supreme Court
Devolution has changed the pattern of law making within the UK by transferring powers in specified areas to the Welsh legislature. The original step was the Government of Wales Act 1998, which established a National Assembly for Wales with limited powers. Subsequent legislation, including the Government of Wales Act 2006 and later Wales Acts, developed the Senedd’s powers and procedures, and since a 2011 referendum the Welsh legislature has been able to pass Acts (formerly Measures) in devolved areas without needing UK Parliament approval. The Senedd (Welsh Parliament) now legislates in areas such as education, health and certain aspects of local government, while the UK Parliament retains powers over reserved matters such as defence and foreign affairs. The Supreme Court plays a crucial role in the devolution settlement by resolving disputes about whether a provision is within the competence of the Welsh legislature and by interpreting the scope of devolved powers. For exam answers, students should be able to explain the distinction between devolved and reserved matters and to give examples of how a competence challenge might arise, for instance where the Senedd passes legislation said to have effects beyond its devolved area.

## Delegated legislation: types, reasons and controls
Delegated legislation (also called secondary legislation) covers rules made by ministers, the Welsh Government or other bodies under powers given by an Act of Parliament. Common types include statutory instruments, by‑laws made by local authorities, and Orders in Council used for particular executive actions. Delegated legislation is used because Parliament does not have the time or technical expertise to legislate every detail; it allows flexible and specialist rules to be introduced and amended more quickly than primary legislation. However, this convenience raises questions about democratic accountability and legal certainty. Controls exist to address those concerns. Parliamentary scrutiny comes through affirmative and negative resolution procedures and through committee review, and judicial review provides a legal check if delegated rules exceed the enabling Act or are made unlawfully. In the devolved context, equivalent controls apply to the Welsh legislature’s use of delegated powers, and the courts can strike down secondary measures that exceed competence. When writing about delegated legislation, illustrate both practical advantages and democratic anxieties, and give examples of how simple statutory limits in the parent Act can prevent misuse.

## Statutory interpretation and the role of aids
Statutory interpretation is the judicial process of working out what a statute means in practice. Judges apply established approaches such as the literal rule, which gives words their ordinary meaning; the golden rule, which allows a narrow departure from literal meaning to avoid absurdity; and the mischief rule and purposive approach, which look to the gap the statute was intended to remedy or to the broader legislative purpose. Over recent decades courts have become more willing to use the purposive approach, especially where human rights or devolved competence issues are engaged. To interpret a statute, judges rely on intrinsic aids found within the Act itself—such as long and short titles, preambles, schedules and punctuation—and extrinsic aids like earlier drafts, Law Commission reports, parliamentary materials and specialist dictionaries. For exam practice, students should be able to explain when different rules are used and to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each. It is also valuable to show how interpretive choices can affect outcomes: a purposive reading may uphold a public interest objective, whereas a literal reading may produce an unexpected or harsh result.

## Judicial precedent and the court hierarchy
Judicial precedent is the system by which decisions of higher courts bind lower courts, creating legal certainty and predictability. The doctrine of precedent requires courts to identify the ratio decidendi—the legal principle necessary for the decision—and distinguishes it from obiter dicta, comments made in passing that are persuasive but not binding. The English and Welsh courts operate in a clear hierarchy: the Supreme Court sits at the top, followed by the Court of Appeal, the High Court and specialist tribunals and lower courts. The Supreme Court’s decisions bind all lower courts, and since the Practice Statement of 1966 the highest court has a limited power to depart from its own earlier decisions in exceptional circumstances. The Court of Appeal is usually bound by its earlier decisions but can use established exceptions, and High Court judges may distinguish earlier authority on the facts. For revision, students should practice identifying ratio and obiter in cases, and use concrete case examples to show how precedent develops or is modified. You should also be ready to evaluate advantages—such as stability and fairness—and disadvantages—such as rigidity or slow adaptation to social change.

## Influences on law making and law reform bodies
Law making rarely occurs in isolation from social forces. Pressure groups, public opinion, expert committees and the media all influence the shape and timing of legislation. Pressure groups can bring technical expertise to ministers or mount public campaigns that make reform politically attractive. Judicial influence can also be significant: a landmark court decision can prompt Parliament to legislate to change the law. Formal law reform agencies such as the Law Commission play an institutional role by researching problems, consulting widely and proposing systematic reforms and consolidation of statutes. The Law Commission’s reports have led to major reforms, and its recommendations are often used by government departments when drafting Bills. For students, it helps to explain how influence works in practice: a scandal may create political momentum, a Law Commission report provides a blueprint for safe reform, and pressure group lobbying focuses parliamentary attention. When evaluating influences, consider both democratic accountability and the risk of undue or unrepresentative pressure.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on law making and devolution, begin by carefully identifying the legal issue and stating which source of law or constitutional principle is at stake. Use clear legal terminology throughout: refer to Parliamentary sovereignty, delegated legislation, legislative competence, and precedent where relevant. For knowledge questions, explain processes step by step—describe the stages of a Bill, the forms of delegated legislation, or the hierarchy of the courts. For application and problem questions, apply the relevant rules to the facts and reach a supported conclusion; show how a competence issue might be argued from both sides and indicate what remedy a court could grant. In essays that require evaluation, balance description with critical analysis: consider advantages and disadvantages, constitutional implications and practical effects on access to justice. Always support arguments with examples of statutes, cases or reforms—these anchor abstract points and demonstrate wider understanding. Finally, manage your time so that you allocate marks proportionately: spend longer on higher‑mark questions and leave a few minutes at the end of each answer to proofread and ensure your legal reasoning is clearly signposted and your conclusion explicit.
