# Contract formation, terms and privity (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## What contract law is for and how it fits into the wider legal system
Contract law exists to give legal effect to agreements that parties make with each other, providing predictability and a remedy when promises are broken. At its heart are rules that determine when an agreement becomes legally binding, what each party must do, and what happens when obligations are not fulfilled. Understanding contract law requires seeing it both as a set of doctrinal rules—offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations—and as a policy-influenced area that balances freedom of contract with consumer protection, fairness and economic efficiency. For students this means learning the black-letter rules, the leading authorities that illustrate those rules, and the underlying policy arguments that judges and legislators use when resolving disputes.

## Formation: offer and acceptance
A contract is formed when there is a clear offer by one party and an acceptance by another, with both parties manifesting agreement on the same terms. An offer is an expression of willingness to contract on specified terms, capable of being accepted and thereby creating legal relations; invitations to treat are not offers and include shop displays, advertisements in many cases, and price lists. Unilateral offers exist where a promise is made to anyone who performs a stipulated act, and acceptance in such cases can be by performance rather than communication, as illustrated in classic examples where a public promise with clear terms was acted upon.

Acceptance must mirror the offer: it must be clear, unconditional and communicated to the offeror unless the offeror dispenses with communication (as in unilateral offers). A counter-offer destroys the original offer, replacing it with a new proposal; silence generally does not amount to acceptance. The rules about when acceptance takes effect differ according to the method used. Postal acceptance is traditionally effective when posted (the postal rule), which can lead to odd results and must be handled carefully in exam answers. With instantaneous communications—telephone, email, instant messaging—acceptance is usually effective when received, but circumstances and the parties’ intentions may affect this. Students should be ready to apply these principles to fact patterns where timing and form of communication are critical.

## Formation: consideration and intention to create legal relations
Consideration is the price paid for a promise and is required to make a simple contract legally enforceable. It must be sufficient but need not be adequate; the courts will not generally assess the commercial wisdom of the bargain. The orthodox rules exclude past consideration—performing an act before a promise is made will not furnish consideration for that promise—and they also treat performance of an existing contractual duty as ordinarily not being good consideration for a new promise. However, commercial developments have softened some of these strict rules: practical benefits conferred on one party can, in certain circumstances, amount to valid consideration for a promise, and the doctrine of promissory estoppel can prevent a promisor from insisting on strict legal rights where they have made a clear promise to forbear and the promisee has relied upon it to their detriment. Intention to create legal relations distinguishes commercial agreements, which are presumed to be legally binding, from domestic and social arrangements, which are generally not presumed to have legal effect unless the facts show clear intention otherwise. Classic domestic examples show how courts look for objective indicators—such as written agreements or post-separation arrangements—to infer intention.

## Terms of the contract: express, implied and classification
Terms are the promises that make up the parties’ bargain and determine the obligations and remedies available. Express terms are those the parties have explicitly agreed, whether orally or in writing. The distinction between a representation and a contractual term can be finely balanced: the courts ask whether the term was intended to be binding, judged by the importance attached by the parties, the timing of the statement and the relative expertise of the parties. Terms may also be implied by law, by custom in a trade, or by the courts to give business efficacy to the contract or to reflect what sensible parties would have intended. The famous tests used by judges to imply terms—such as the “business efficacy” principle and the “officious bystander” test—help to show when an unstated promise forms part of the contract.

Classifying terms as conditions, warranties or innominate (intermediate) terms is essential because the classification determines remedies. Conditions are central terms whose breach entitles the innocent party to terminate and to claim damages; warranties are lesser promises, the breach of which gives only damages. Innominate terms require an inquiry into the seriousness of the breach and its consequences: a breach that deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract may justify termination, while a less serious breach will not. Recognising the nature of the term and the effect of the breach is a frequent focus of problem questions.

## How terms become part of the contract and the control of unfair terms
Not every term that one party wishes to include will be binding. Incorporation deals with how terms are brought into the contract: by signature, by reasonable notice, or by a course of dealing between the parties. A signed written contract will generally bind the signer to its terms even if they did not read them, but if there is no signature notice must be given before or at the time of contracting. Previous consistent dealings can incorporate terms if it is reasonable to assume the parties intended to be governed by the same terms each time. The content and wording of exclusion and limitation clauses also matter: such clauses seek to restrict liability and will be construed strictly, because courts are reluctant to enforce attempts to exclude fundamental obligations. Statutory controls limit the extent to which businesses can rely on exclusion clauses. Consumer protection legislation and the Unfair Contract Terms Act operate to render many attempts to exclude liability ineffective or subject to a reasonableness test, particularly in consumer and business-to-business contexts, and more recent consumer rights statutes further regulate what can be imposed on consumers. For students, the practical task in exam answers is to identify whether a term was incorporated and whether any statutory or common law principle limits its effect.

## Privity of contract and third party rights
The privity rule states that only the parties to a contract can sue or be sued on it: a stranger to the bargain ordinarily has no enforceable rights even if the contract was intended to benefit them. This rule can lead to harsh outcomes where one party promises to confer a benefit on a third person but that person cannot enforce the promise. Over time, a series of common law exceptions and devices emerged to mitigate the rigidity of privity. Agency allows an agent to bind a principal; assignment permits transfer of contractual rights in many situations; collateral contracts can be used to find a separate binding promise where the main contract does not itself give rise to a right for the third party; and trusts can be used to create enforceable rights in favour of a beneficiary.

A major statutory reform in modern law is the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, which allows a third party to enforce a contractual term if the contract expressly provides for it, or if the term purports to confer a benefit on the third party unless it appears that the contracting parties did not intend the third party to have a right. The Act therefore preserves party autonomy while giving courts a mechanism to enforce intended benefits against the promisor, subject to any exclusions the parties have made. Students should be ready to explain when the Act applies and when it does not—for example, it does not generally alter the rules on consideration or the basic duty of performance, and parties can exclude the Act at the time the contract is made. Practical examples include construction contracts where payment is to be made to a subcontractor, or life insurance arrangements where a third party beneficiary is intended to receive a payout. When the Act does not apply, students should look for the older pathways—collateral contracts or agency, for instance—that might confer enforceable rights.

## Exam technique
When answering contract questions, read the problem carefully and identify the precise legal issues: is the question about formation, the correctness of terms, the effect of a clause, or the rights of a third party? Start with a concise statement of the relevant legal rule, then apply the law to the facts in a focused way. Use the IRAC approach—Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion—but present it in fluent prose that explains why each rule matters and how the facts satisfy or fail the elements of that rule. Where case law or statutory provisions are part of the syllabus, mention leading authorities and explain their principles rather than simply naming cases. For essay-style questions, balance descriptive law with evaluation: where rules produce harsh or commercially impractical results, briefly discuss criticisms or reforms and the policy justifications for alternative approaches. For problem questions about privity, always consider whether the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 applies before resorting to older exceptions. When dealing with incorporation and exclusion clauses, pay attention to timing, notice and the conduct of the parties, and remember to assess any statutory controls such as reasonableness tests. Time management is essential: allocate time to identify issues, apply the law, reach clear conclusions for each issue, and write a brief overall conclusion that answers the question directly. Clear structure, accurate legal principles, and precise application to the facts will secure marks.
