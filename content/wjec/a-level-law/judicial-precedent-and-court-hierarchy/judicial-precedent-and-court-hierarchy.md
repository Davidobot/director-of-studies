# Judicial precedent and court hierarchy (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## What judicial precedent is and why it matters
Judicial precedent is the process by which past judicial decisions are used as a source of law in later cases. In a common law system such as that of England and Wales, judges do not merely apply rules created by Parliament: they also develop legal principles by deciding disputes. When a court sets out a legal rule to decide a case, that rule can influence and bind the courts below it in later disputes with similar facts. This system—known by the Latin tag stare decisis, to stand by what has been decided—promotes consistency, predictability and fairness by ensuring like cases are treated alike. For students, understanding precedent is crucial because many substantive rules you study in tort, contract and criminal law have their shape and scope through judicial decisions, not only through statutes.

## The doctrine of precedent: ratio decidendi and obiter dicta
At the heart of precedent are two key concepts: ratio decidendi and obiter dicta. Ratio decidendi is the legal principle or reasoning that is essential to the decision; it is the part of the judgment that creates a binding precedent. Obiter dicta are remarks or observations made by a judge that are not essential to deciding the case; they are not binding but may be persuasive. Distinguishing ratio from obiter is often the most technically demanding part of precedent work. To identify the ratio, focus on the material facts that gave rise to the legal question and the principle the court relied on to reach its conclusion. When a case is decided by a panel of judges, the ratio is usually the reasoning of the majority. Students should beware of relying on stray comments or policy observations as if they were binding law; such comments can nevertheless influence later courts and are often picked up as persuasive authority.

## The court hierarchy and how precedent flows
The operation of precedent depends on the court hierarchy. The Supreme Court sits at the apex of the judicial structure and its decisions bind all lower courts. Below it, the Court of Appeal is divided into Civil and Criminal divisions; its decisions bind courts below it, and usually bind the lower courts in their own division and the High Court, subject to particular exceptions. The High Court and its divisional courts create important precedents in civil law and questions of public law. The Crown Court and County Courts decide many trial matters and their decisions do not bind higher courts, although record of their reasoning can be persuasive. Magistrates' courts handle the great majority of criminal cases at first instance and do not create binding precedent. Specialist tribunals operate alongside courts and their decisions may be persuasive, especially when they show expertise in a technical area. The practical effect for legal argument is that when you are solving a problem you must first look for decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal that are on point; these will usually be binding. If there is no binding authority, then persuasive sources may be relied upon.

## Binding and persuasive precedent: sources and examples
Binding precedent is produced by higher courts and must be followed by lower courts in cases with materially similar facts. Persuasive precedent can come from a number of places: obiter dicta from higher courts, decisions of courts of coordinate or lower jurisdiction, rulings of the Privy Council, decisions from other common law jurisdictions, and respected academic commentary. The Privy Council, which hears appeals from certain Commonwealth jurisdictions and some specialised bodies, is not binding on domestic courts in England and Wales but its reasoning is often persuasive. Historical examples show how persuasive authority can shape the law: a well-reasoned judgment from a lower court or a respected foreign court can encourage a higher court to adopt a similar approach when there is no domestic precedent. In exam answers you should distinguish clearly between what is binding and what is merely persuasive and explain the weight you would give to persuasive authorities.

## How courts develop and avoid precedent
Precedent is not entirely rigid; the legal system contains mechanisms for development and change. Distinguishing is the technique by which a court avoids applying a previous decision because the material facts are different; it allows the law to be adapted incrementally. Reversing occurs when a higher court, on appeal, overturns the legal conclusion of a lower court in the same case. Overruling is when a higher court, or a later panel of the same court with power to depart, declares that a previous decision was wrong and replaces the legal rule it stated. A famous procedural development was the adoption of a practice that allowed the highest court to depart from its previous decisions in certain circumstances, recognising that absolute rigidity could produce injustice or prevent legal development. In practice, higher courts exercise this power cautiously and will overrule earlier decisions only when necessary to correct error, remove inconsistency, or respond to social and legal developments. These mechanisms balance the values of legal certainty and legal progress.

## Advantages and disadvantages of precedent
The precedent system offers clear advantages. It promotes certainty and predictability, which are especially important for commercial activity and individual behaviour; parties can look to existing case law to estimate how a court might resolve their dispute. It also allows the law to develop organically through the application of legal principles to new fact patterns, enabling judges to refine rules over time. Furthermore, judicial reasoning produces detailed guidance that can be adapted to future cases without the need for constant statutory amendment.

On the other hand, precedent has drawbacks. The volume of case law and the difficulty of identifying the binding ratio can make the law complex and opaque. Precedent may preserve mistakes or outdated rules until a higher court or Parliament intervenes. The system can also be seen as undemocratic because unelected judges can shape law through interpretation and incremental decision-making. Finally, conflicts between earlier decisions or between legal principles created in different contexts can create uncertainty and require difficult choices by appellate courts.

When evaluating precedent in essays, balance these strengths and weaknesses and consider the context: for some areas of law, such as rapidly changing technology or moral standards, the ability of judges to adapt the law may be an advantage; in other contexts, the certainty of statute may be preferable.

## Practical application: using precedent in problem questions
When you approach a problem question about precedent, adopt a clear method. Begin by identifying the legal issues raised by the facts. Next, search for binding authorities: locate Supreme Court and Court of Appeal decisions on the point, summarise the material facts and the ratio they established, and explain whether those facts are materially similar to your problem. If a binding authority exists, apply its ratio directly and consider whether any distinguishing features of your facts make the precedent inapplicable. Where no binding precedent exists, turn to persuasive sources such as obiter dicta, decisions from other jurisdictions, or academic views, and explain how they might influence a court. If there are conflicting precedents, analyse which authority carries greater weight and why; consider whether a higher court might overrule or whether distinguishing is feasible. Use clear legal reasoning: show how the precedent’s principle follows from the material facts, apply it to the problem facts step by step, and explain the likely outcome. Always be explicit about whether you are dealing with binding or persuasive precedent, and where appropriate, discuss policy considerations that a judge might weigh.

Concrete examples help. When the law on contractual intention between domestic parties is considered, courts have treated the decisions in domestic agreement cases as less likely to impose enforceable obligations than commercial cases; a student solving a contract problem would consider Balfour-type domestic cases and whether the facts align or can be distinguished. In tort, the general duty of care principle famously arose from a landmark case and was then applied and refined across many different fact patterns; when applying duty of care in a new scenario, follow how courts have extended or restricted the principle over time.

## Exam technique
In exams, precision and structure are essential when dealing with precedent and hierarchy. Start by stating the applicable legal rule and identifying whether you are addressing binding or persuasive authority. Where you refer to cases, state the material facts succinctly and explain the ratio in the judge’s own terms; avoid long narrative digressions. Always connect authority to the problem facts: say why a precedent applies, can be distinguished, or should be overruled. When asked to evaluate, balance advantages and disadvantages and consider practical consequences and policy. Use the court hierarchy to justify the weight you give to a decision: Supreme Court and Court of Appeal decisions carry more weight than decisions of the High Court or tribunals. If there are conflicting authorities, explain which is more authoritative and why, and consider possible outcomes if the issue reached the highest court. Finally, manage your time: allocate more time to the main issues and to applying authority to facts, and remember that clear, logically ordered argument wins marks over extensive but unfocused description.
