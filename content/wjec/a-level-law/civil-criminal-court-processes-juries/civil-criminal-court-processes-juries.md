# Civil and criminal court processes and juries (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of the Welsh and English court structure and jurisdiction
The Welsh and English legal systems operate within a single court framework that deals with both civil and criminal matters but with important differences in procedure and purpose. Civil disputes are primarily heard in the County Courts and the High Court, while criminal cases start in the magistrates’ courts and, for the more serious offences, proceed to the Crown Court. Above these are the appellate courts: the Court of Appeal for civil and criminal appeals and, at the apex, the Supreme Court which settles points of law of the greatest public importance. Tribunals exist alongside the courts as specialist bodies dealing with administrative and regulatory disputes, and they form a separate tier with a First-tier and Upper Tribunal structure. Understanding which court has jurisdiction over a dispute is essential because jurisdiction determines the applicable procedure, available remedies and the route of appeal.

## Civil court processes: from claim to remedy
A civil claim usually begins when a claimant issues proceedings in the appropriate court, most often a County Court for smaller claims or the High Court for high-value or complex matters. Pre-action protocols encourage parties to exchange information and attempt settlement before litigation begins, reflecting policy aims to reduce cost and delay. Once proceedings are issued, case management directions help tailor the process: timetables for disclosure, witness statements and trial bundles are set to ensure fairness and proportionate use of resources. Trials in civil courts focus on questions of liability and remedy, with the standard of proof being the balance of probabilities. Remedies available include damages to compensate loss, injunctions to compel or restrain conduct, specific performance in limited circumstances and declaratory relief. If a party is dissatisfied with a County Court decision, they can usually appeal to the High Court by permission on a point of law or in some cases on fact and procedure. The appellate route continues to the Court of Appeal and, ultimately, to the Supreme Court, although leave to appeal is required at the highest levels.

## Criminal court processes: magistrates, Crown Court and sentencing
Criminal matters usually enter the system at the magistrates’ courts where the vast majority of summary offences are tried, and preliminary hearings are held for indictable offences. Magistrates—or legally trained district judges in some courts—decide guilt in summary cases and conduct the early stages of more serious cases, including custody and bail decisions. Indictable and either-way offences that proceed to jury trial are tried in the Crown Court before a judge and jury; the Crown Court also hears appeals from the magistrates’ courts and sentencing appeals. The criminal trial process is adversarial: the prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt, evidence is tested via cross-examination, and the judge directs the jury on points of law. Sentencing follows conviction, and the courts apply objectives such as punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public and reparation. Sentencers are guided by statutory provisions and sentencing guidelines which promote consistency; where a sentence is alleged to be unduly lenient it can be challenged by appeal or by referral to higher authorities in specified circumstances.

## The role, selection and limits of juries
Juries are a distinctive feature of serious criminal trials and retain a symbolic and practical role in allowing ordinary people to decide questions of fact. Jury service is normally open to citizens meeting eligibility criteria, and selection is by random ballot from the electoral register followed by a process of empanelling where jurors are sworn in. Certain checks—known as vetting—can take place in narrow circumstances to ensure suitability, and legal principles govern challenges to jurors for cause. Jurors must decide fact and reach a verdict based on the evidence and the judge’s directions; the standard of proof in criminal trials is beyond reasonable doubt. The law permits majority verdicts in specified circumstances to avoid mistrials where unanimity is not achieved, and the precise arrangements vary with jury size and statute. The secrecy of jury deliberations is a strong legal rule: jurors cannot normally give evidence about their discussions in court. This secrecy protects the independence of deliberation but also attracts criticism when alleged irregularities arise. Juries in civil cases are now rare and confined to particular actions, such as defamation or certain torts, and their role is more limited because civil disputes often involve complex issues of law and accountancy that judges may be better placed to resolve.

## Criticisms of the jury system and possible alternatives
Despite their historical status, juries face sustained criticism. Some argue that jurors lack the technical expertise for complex modern cases and may be swayed by emotion or prejudice. Others point to practical problems: time and cost, the difficulty of understanding forensic or specialist evidence, and the impossibility of probing jury reasoning because of deliberation secrecy. High-profile controversies about jury tampering and media influence have also prompted debate. Alternatives suggested include judge-only trials, professional jurors, mixed tribunals combining lay and legally qualified members, or expanded use of triangulated decision-makers for particularly technical cases. Each alternative raises its own concerns about legitimacy, impartiality and public confidence. When considering reform, it is important to balance the democratic value and community participation of the jury with the need for accurate and efficient fact-finding.

## Legal personnel and judicial independence
Court processes rely on a range of legal professionals, each with defined roles. Solicitors generally advise clients, handle paperwork and may represent clients in lower courts; barristers specialise in advocacy and are often instructed for court hearings in higher courts. Legal executives and paralegals support case preparation and practice. The judiciary ranges from lay magistrates and district judges in the magistrates’ courts, through Circuit and High Court judges, to Lords or Justices of the Supreme Court. Judicial selection and training are structured to promote competence and independence. Judicial independence is a constitutional principle that underpins fair trials: judges must be free from improper influence and able to apply the law impartially. Removal and disciplinary mechanisms exist but are deliberately stringent to protect independence; at the same time, accountability is maintained through reasoned judgments and the appellate system.

## Tribunals, alternative dispute resolution and access to justice
Many disputes are resolved outside traditional courts. Tribunals hear matters such as social security, immigration and employment disputes in a system designed to be more specialist and informal than the courts, with its own appellate structure. Arbitration offers a private, binding forum often used in commercial disputes, with the advantage of specialist arbitrators and confidentiality. Mediation and conciliation provide non-binding routes focused on negotiated settlement, which can preserve relationships and reduce cost. Access to justice remains a central concern: public funding for civil and criminal legal assistance is governed by eligibility criteria including means and merits testing. Legal aid supports many criminal defendants and some civil litigants, but funding pressures have reduced coverage in many areas, increasing reliance on pro bono work, conditional fee arrangements and other private funding models. Conditional fee agreements and similar mechanisms can help litigants bring cases but often involve trade-offs about recoverability of costs and potential risk.

## Evidence, appeals, statutory interpretation and judicial review in practice
Court processes are shaped by rules of evidence, burdens and standards. In criminal cases the prosecution must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt; in civil cases the balance of probabilities applies. Judges direct juries on the law and admissibility of evidence, and appellate courts supervise both errors of law and, where appropriate, errors of fact. The doctrine of precedent means that decisions of higher courts bind lower courts, creating predictability, while judges may distinguish facts to avoid an unfair application of precedent. Statutory interpretation—using literal, golden, mischief or purposive approaches—plays a continual role when legislation needs to be applied to particular facts. When public bodies exceed lawful power, individuals can seek judicial review, a process by which courts supervise legality, rationality and procedural propriety of administrative action. Remedies in judicial review can include quashing declarations and mandatory orders, which have the practical effect of controlling public decision-making. Together, these processes ensure that both substantive law and procedural rules operate coherently within the justice system.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on court processes and juries, begin by identifying whether the question concerns civil or criminal procedure, as this determines issues such as burden and standard of proof, available remedies and typical court routes. Use clear signposting in your answer: set out the relevant court hierarchy, explain the steps in the process in chronological order, and apply legal principles to the facts or the scenario provided. When discussing juries, distinguish between their role in criminal trials and the limited, mostly historical, use in civil trials, and consider both practical operation (selection, deliberation, verdict forms) and criticisms or reforms. Incorporate legal skills by explaining relevant doctrines—such as precedent and statutory interpretation—where they influence process, and evaluate competing perspectives by weighing advantages and disadvantages, for example when considering jury secrecy versus the need for transparency. Use statutory language and specialist terminology accurately, but explain technical terms briefly to show understanding. Where appropriate, refer to concrete examples or practice-based consequences—for instance, the impact of legal aid changes on access to justice, or how sentencing guidelines shape judicial decision-making—to demonstrate wider awareness. Finally, manage time so you have space to apply the law to facts and to provide a short, focused conclusion that answers the question directly and indicates the strength of your argument.
