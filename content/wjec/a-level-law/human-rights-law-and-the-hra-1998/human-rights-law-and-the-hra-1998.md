# Human rights law and the Human Rights Act 1998 (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: what is human rights law and why it matters for the A-level
Human rights law is the body of rules that protects fundamental freedoms and entitlements against abuse by the state and sometimes by other powerful actors. At A-level this topic combines legal doctrine with constitutional themes: the relationship between courts and Parliament, the limits of state power, and the tension between the protection of individuals and wider public interests. The Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) brought most of the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into the United Kingdom’s domestic law, so students studying WJEC / Eduqas law must understand both the Convention rights themselves and how the HRA changes the practical operation of those rights within the UK legal system. Knowledge of the HRA is assessed both in problem questions, where you must apply rights to facts, and in essays that ask you to analyse and evaluate the law’s theory and operation.

## The European Convention on Human Rights and core concepts
The European Convention on Human Rights is an international treaty that sets out civil and political rights such as the right to life, the right to a fair trial, and freedoms of expression, assembly and association. For A-level study the Convention is important not simply as a list of rights but because each right contains internal limits and conditions. For example, Articles 8, 10 and 11—right to respect for private and family life, freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly and association—each allow restrictions when they are “in accordance with the law”, pursue a legitimate aim (such as national security, public safety, prevention of crime or protection of the rights of others) and are “necessary in a democratic society”. The concept of proportionality underlies the test for necessity: a restriction must pursue the legitimate aim and be proportionate to it, striking a fair balance between the individual interest and the public interest. The Convention also recognises that states have a margin of appreciation, so Strasbourg decisions may allow national authorities some leeway, especially when balancing sensitive matters.

## The Human Rights Act 1998: how it works in domestic law
The HRA makes the Convention rights enforceable in UK courts. It does not give the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) direct power over domestic courts, but it requires courts to take Strasbourg case law into account. There are several key features of the Act that you should memorise and be able to apply in exam answers. Section 6 makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with a Convention right; this brings within domestic reach actions by ministers, local authorities, and other bodies exercising public functions. Section 2 requires UK courts to “take into account” ECtHR decisions; they are persuasive rather than strictly binding. Section 3 imposes an interpretive obligation: domestic legislation must be read and given effect, as far as possible, in a way which is compatible with Convention rights. Where compatibility cannot be achieved by interpretation, section 4 allows higher courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility, signalling that primary legislation conflicts with the Convention but leaving it to Parliament to decide how to respond. Section 7 gives individuals the right to bring proceedings for breach of their Convention rights. Section 10 allows ministers, in limited circumstances, to make remedial orders to amend defective legislation after a declaration of incompatibility. Knowing these sections and what they allow courts and government to do will help you structure legal arguments and evaluation.

## How rights operate in practice: positive and negative obligations, and example rights
Convention rights can impose both negative obligations (to refrain from interfering) and positive obligations (to take steps to protect rights). For instance, Article 10’s freedom of expression typically requires the state not to censor speech unlawfully, whereas Article 8 can require public bodies to take protective action when they know of a real risk to an individual’s private or family life. The domestic courts have used the HRA to develop these concepts: in some cases the courts have required public authorities to act positively to protect vulnerable people. Students should be comfortable identifying whether the alleged interference is by a public authority (so s.6 HRA is engaged), whether there is an interference with a Convention right, and whether any interference can be justified under the Convention test. Article 8 commonly appears in problem questions where privacy, family relationships or home rights are at stake; Article 10 often clashes with Article 8 where media publication and privacy collide; Article 11 appears where protests and police control of demonstrations are challenged. Practical examples help: the courts have used section 3 to interpret statutes in a rights-compatible way in cases such as Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza where a domestic provision was read in a manner consistent with Convention principles, and the House of Lords’ decision in R v A (No 2) illustrates the use of s.3 to allow evidence in rape trials in a way that balanced fair trial rights with the need to protect complainants.

## Enforcement, remedies and the role of Strasbourg
When domestic remedies have been exhausted or are ineffective, individuals can take their case to the ECtHR in Strasbourg. The Act encourages domestic resolution: UK courts must consider Convention rights and can give remedies such as declarations of incompatibility, damages, injunctions and declarations of unlawful action by public authorities. A declaration of incompatibility does not invalidate the statute that caused the breach; it is a political and legal signal to Parliament that action is needed. If an incompatibility is found, Parliament or the government can respond through legislation or, where permitted, by using remedial orders. The relationship between UK courts and Strasbourg is dynamic: UK judges look to Strasbourg for guidance but are not mechanically bound, leading to debate about the balance between national sovereignty and international oversight. For students, it is important to explain the practical pathway for a claimant: raise the Convention issue in domestic proceedings, seek remedies including judicial review if appropriate, and only afterwards consider Strasbourg if the domestic system cannot remedy the breach.

## Contemporary debates, devolution and the Human Rights Act
The HRA sits at the intersection of constitutional law and political debate. Supporters argue that it protects minorities and holds public authorities to account, bringing human rights home so citizens can enforce them in domestic courts without travelling to Strasbourg. Critics argue that it gives too much power to judges, undermining parliamentary sovereignty, and that some Strasbourg jurisprudence imposes unfamiliar standards on UK law. These tensions have prompted discussion of a UK Bill of Rights to replace or reform the HRA; proposals have ranged from minor adjustments to wholesale replacement. Devolution adds complexity: the HRA applies across the UK and must be respected by devolved institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the Supreme Court has a central role in resolving conflicts between devolved competence and Convention standards. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has a statutory remit to promote and enforce human rights and equality, and its work provides an institutional context for how rights are advanced in practice. In evaluating the HRA, you should consider empirical questions—how often do courts actually strike down government action; are declarations of incompatibility effective—and normative questions about democracy, accountability and the protection of vulnerable individuals.

## Applying the law in problem questions: a clear route through
When you receive a scenario, begin by identifying whether a Convention right is engaged and whether the action complained of is by a “public authority” under section 6. If the actor is private but performing a public function, explain why s.6 might still apply. Next, set out the elements of the right and explain whether the facts show an “interference”. If there is interference, move to justification: identify the statutory basis (or other legal basis) for the interference, state the legitimate aim it pursues, and apply the three-part Convention test—lawful, pursuing a legitimate aim, and necessary in a democratic society. In practice your necessity analysis should use proportionality: show that the interference was suitable to achieve the aim, that less intrusive means were considered, and that the balance between public and private interests was struck fairly. Don’t forget positive obligations where the state’s failure to act may itself breach rights. Conclude by considering remedies and by evaluating strengths and weaknesses of either side’s arguments, for example by considering margin of appreciation or conflicting rights such as privacy and free expression.

## Exam technique
Good exam technique combines solid knowledge with clear structure and precise use of legal authority. Start essays or problem answers with a short plan so the examiner can follow your argument. In problem questions, answer the specific legal issue rather than rehearsing everything you know about human rights law; focus on the rights engaged, whether a public authority is involved, whether interference can be justified, and what remedies are available. Use statutory section numbers from the HRA (for example s.2, s.3, s.4, s.6 and s.7) and name leading cases to support points; where you cannot remember a case name, explain the legal principle with a brief factual example. Demonstrate evaluation by weighing competing interests: when do judges protect minorities at the cost of parliamentary will, and when is parliamentary action justified in the name of democracy and public safety? For essays, balance description with analysis; a paragraph that merely states the text of an Article scores less well than one that applies the Article to factual patterns and critiques how the law operates. Manage time so you leave space for a concise conclusion that answers the question directly, and always aim to link specific legal rules back to the bigger themes of the specification: law and society, law and morality, and law and justice.
