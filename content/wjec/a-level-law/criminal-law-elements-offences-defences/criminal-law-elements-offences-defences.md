# Criminal law: elements, offences and defences (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

Criminal law sets out the rules that define offences and the principles by which people are held to account. At A-level you must do more than memorise lists of offences: you need to understand why the law draws distinctions between different kinds of conduct, how liability is constructed from its basic elements, and how defences interact with those elements. This guide brings the main ideas together in clear, examinable form and illustrates them with leading authorities and practical pointers for applying the law to scenarios.

## The purpose of criminal law and the structure of liability

Criminal law serves multiple social functions: it protects people and property, expresses community moral censure, deters harmful conduct, and provides a framework for punishment and rehabilitation. These aims influence how offences are defined and how courts treat intent, negligence and causation. In practical terms, criminal liability is built from distinct parts. For most offences a prosecution must prove two core elements: the actus reus, the external wrongful act or omission, and the mens rea, the defendant’s mental state at the time. Where the legislature creates a strict liability offence it may remove or limit the mens rea requirement; where a statute creates an offence based on results (for example death or grievous bodily harm) causation links the defendant’s conduct to that result. Throughout, the prosecution bears the burden of proof and must satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt.

## Actus reus: voluntary acts, omissions and consequences

The actus reus is the criminal conduct that the law prohibits. It may be a positive act, an omission to act where there is a legal duty, or a state of affairs specified by statute. Voluntariness is essential: involuntary movements are not criminal unless the defendant’s prior conduct has created liability. A classic illustration is the difference between a person who voluntarily strikes another and a person who has a seizure and unintentionally injures someone; the former engages the actus reus, the latter normally does not.

Omissions give rise to liability only where the law imposes a duty to act. Duties may arise from statute, contract, the creation of risk (for example starting a dangerous process), a relationship (parent and child), or an assumption of responsibility. Where conduct must cause a particular consequence, the prosecution must prove factual causation (the “but for” test) and legal causation. The courts resolve legal causation by asking whether the defendant’s act was more than a minimal cause and whether any intervening act (act of a third party, the victim’s own conduct, or medical treatment) breaks the chain. Cases such as R v White, R v Jordan and R v Smith illustrate how courts treat these issues: a defendant whose action is a significant contributing cause will normally be held liable unless a wholly unforeseeable and independent intervening act renders the original conduct too remote.

## Mens rea: intention, recklessness and negligence

Mens rea describes the mental element that the law requires. Intention is the clearest form: direct intention is where the defendant aims to bring about a result; oblique intention covers cases where a result is not the defendant’s primary aim but is a virtually certain consequence which the defendant appreciated, as explained in R v Woollin. Recklessness involves conscious awareness of a risk and an unjustified taking of that risk; the law in England and Wales follows a subjective approach to recklessness, asking whether the defendant foresaw the risk and nevertheless acted. Historically different formulations arose (for example the objective Caldwell test), but the modern approach restores focus on the defendant’s state of mind.

Negligence as a mens rea is rarer in criminal law but appears in certain statutory offences and in gross negligence manslaughter. Where the law uses negligence, liability turns on whether the defendant fell so far below the standard of the reasonable person that criminal sanction is appropriate. The distinction between fault-based mens rea and strict liability is important: strict liability offences require only proof of the actus reus and are typically confined to regulatory areas where Parliament creates liability to promote public protection.

When a statute is silent about mens rea the courts may imply a requirement of fault unless the legislative context suggests an intention to create strict liability. The Gammon principles guide judges in deciding whether Parliament intended to exclude mens rea for a particular offence.

## Offences against the person: murder, manslaughter and non-fatal offences

Offences against the person are central to criminal law study. Murder requires unlawful killing of a human being with the requisite mens rea: intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. The law of intention encompasses both direct and oblique intention and the courts apply the Woollin test when assessing whether a defendant had oblique intention. Voluntary manslaughter operates as a partial defence to murder and reduces liability to manslaughter where the defendant successfully pleads either loss of control (the statutory replacement for old provocation rules under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009) or diminished responsibility (an abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition that substantially impairs responsibility).

Involuntary manslaughter comes in two main forms. Constructive (unlawful act) manslaughter requires a dangerous unlawful act that causes death, with the foundational requirements set out in R v Church. Gross negligence manslaughter requires a duty of care, breach that falls far below the expected standard and causes death, as in R v Adomako. Non-fatal offences include assault and battery, where assault is the act or words causing the victim to apprehend immediate unlawful force and battery is the application of unlawful force; the cases of Logdon, Collins v Wilcock and R v Ireland illustrate these concepts. The Offences Against the Person Act 1861 also provides for offences producing actual bodily harm (s.47) and grievous bodily harm (s.20 and s.18), with s.18 reserved for cases where there is specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

## Property offences, robbery, burglary and inchoate liability

Property offences are another core area. Theft under the Theft Act 1968 requires appropriation of property belonging to another with dishonest intent to permanently deprive. The statutory structure identifies the actus reus as appropriation and the mens rea as dishonesty plus the intention to permanently deprive. The legal test for dishonesty is now governed by the decision in Ivey v Genting Casinos, which asks whether the defendant’s conduct would be regarded as dishonest by ordinary standards, taking into account the defendant’s actual belief about the facts. Robbery adds the element of force or the threat of force to a completed theft and is an aggravated form of theft. Burglary under s.9 Theft Act 1968 criminalises entering as a trespasser with intent to steal or inflict grievous bodily harm (s.9(1)(a)) or entering and then committing an offence (s.9(1)(b)).

Inchoate offences deal with conduct that falls short of completion. Attempt is defined by statute and the courts have established that the actus reus requires conduct that is “more than merely preparatory” to the commission of the offence; authorities such as R v Gullefer guide application. Attempts to commit impossible crimes remain criminal (R v Shivpuri), and mens rea for attempt mirrors the mens rea required for the substantive offence.

## Defences: how they work and their limits

Defences operate either by denying an essential element of the offence or by providing an excuse or justification that, if accepted, either exculpates the defendant entirely or reduces liability. Insanity is governed by the M’Naghten rules: a defendant must show that at the time of the act they were labouring under a defect of reason caused by a disease of the mind so that they did not know the nature and quality of the act or did not know it was wrong. A successful plea leads to a special verdict with hospital or other disposals.

Automatism describes involuntary conduct caused by an external factor (for example a blow to the head or the unexpected effects of medication). The law distinguishes sane automatism (which, if made out, leads to full acquittal) from insane automatism (which is treated within the defective-memory framework associated with insanity). Cases such as Bratty, R v Quick and R v Hennessy illustrate the boundaries between internal and external causes.

Intoxication requires careful analysis. Voluntary intoxication is not a defence to crimes of basic intent but may negate mens rea for crimes of specific intent; courts apply the distinction in cases such as DPP v Majewski and related authorities. Involuntary intoxication, where the defendant did not know they were ingesting an intoxicant or were coerced, may exculpate if it negates the required mens rea.

Self-defence allows a person to use reasonable force to defend themselves, others or property. The reasonableness of force is assessed objectively but judged in the context of the defendant’s perception of the situation at the time. Statutory provisions and case law stress that force must be necessary and proportionate; mistaken belief can be relevant if it was honestly held.

Duress by threats and duress of circumstances operate where the defendant acts because they reasonably believe they or others face death or serious harm. The law limits duress as a defence to certain offences; it is not available for murder and requires that the defendant’s belief be both genuine and, in most formulations, reasonable. Diminished responsibility and loss of control (already mentioned) are partial defences for homicide and reduce murder to manslaughter.

Throughout, the presence or absence of a defence can be decisive, but many defences have tightly defined legal tests and factual thresholds. Students should practise applying each statutory and common-law test to a range of hypothetical facts to see how small differences in perception, timing or causation can alter the outcome.

## Special rules: strict liability, burden and standard of proof, and sentencing

Certain offences are strict liability: conviction requires proof of the prohibited act regardless of intent. These offences are common in regulatory law (food safety, public welfare) and are justified on public protection grounds. Courts are cautious before implying strict liability and use interpretive principles to decide whether Parliament intended such an outcome.

The burden of proof ordinarily rests on the prosecution, which must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt; where the legislature places a reverse burden (for example requiring a defendant to prove a particular defence on the balance of probabilities) the court must consider compatibility with human rights and the wider constitutional framework. Sentencing follows conviction and draws on statutory guidance and judicial principles: the law distinguishes retributive, deterrent, rehabilitative and protective aims and evidence such as previous convictions, culpability and harm affects the outcome.

## Exam technique

In examinations, organisation and the application of legal reasoning are just as important as knowledge. Start by identifying the legal issues raised by the facts and state the relevant legal rules clearly. For each element of an offence ask whether the facts satisfy the actus reus, then whether they satisfy the mens rea; where causation is in issue, apply factual and legal causation tests and consider possible intervening acts. When a defence is raised, set out the statutory or judicial test and apply each element to the facts in turn. Use leading case names to show legal knowledge but focus your marks-winning work on analysis: explain how the authorities guide application, why an element is or is not satisfied, and whether policy or fairness considerations might favour one outcome over another. For evaluation questions, weigh competing arguments, consider the law’s aims and limits, and reach a supported conclusion that addresses the question directly.

Time management is vital. For problem questions allocate time to reading the facts, planning the structure (issues, law, application, conclusion), and leaving a short period for checking. For essay-style questions aim to combine AO1 (knowledge and explanation), AO2 (application) and AO3 (analysis and evaluation): define terms, show how the law operates through cases or statute, evaluate strengths and weaknesses, and offer a balanced final view. Practice with past paper scenarios, and get feedback on whether your argumentation is precise, legally accurate and well-supported.
