# Contract: misrepresentation, discharge and remedies (A-level Law WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of misrepresentation in contract law
Misrepresentation occurs when a false statement of fact induces a party to enter a contract. It is a vitiating factor: a misrepresentation does not make a contract automatically void, but it renders the contract voidable at the option of the innocent party. The law recognises that people make contractual decisions on the basis of information provided by others, and it therefore provides ways to undo or compensate for bargains reached on the basis of false information. In studying misrepresentation you should focus on three interconnected areas: the types of misrepresentation and their elements, the remedies available to the innocent party, and the practical limits on those remedies. Understanding these principles is essential because they often determine whether a contract can be rescinded and whether the claimant can obtain damages to compensate for losses caused by the false statement.

## Types of misrepresentation and how to prove them
Misrepresentations are usually classified as fraudulent, negligent or innocent. A fraudulent misrepresentation requires that the maker of the statement knew it was false, was reckless as to its truth, or made it with the intention that the other party should rely on it. Proving fraud is a high threshold because the claimant must demonstrate the maker’s state of mind. Negligent misrepresentation arises where the defendant has made a statement carelessly or without reasonable grounds for belief in its truth. The landmark authority for negligent statements outside pure contract emerges from the law of negligent misstatement, where a duty of care may be owed by the person making the statement to the person relying on it. Statute then provides an additional route for negligent misrepresentation in the commercial context. Innocent misrepresentation occurs where the person honestly believed the statement to be true and had reasonable grounds for that belief. The practical consequence of the classification is that different remedies are available depending on which type of misrepresentation is proved, and the remedies differ in scope and in the ease with which a claimant can obtain them.

To establish any misrepresentation you must show a false statement of existing fact or law (representations about future intent or sales puffery are less likely to qualify), that the false statement was made to the claimant or their agent, that the claimant relied on it, and that the reliance induced entry into the contract. Reliance must be reasonable: if the claimant knew the statement was untrue, or if an innocent claimant could have discovered the truth by taking reasonable steps, the claim may fail.

## Remedies for misrepresentation: rescission and damages
The primary remedy for a vitiating misrepresentation is rescission. Rescission aims to unwind the contract and restore the parties, so far as possible, to the positions they occupied before contracting. Rescission is discretionary and equitable; it may be refused where it would be inequitable to grant it. Common bars to rescission include affirmation of the contract by the innocent party after discovering the falsehood, an unreasonable lapse of time before seeking rescission, the impossibility of restoring the parties to their original position (restitutio in integrum), and the intervention of third-party rights (for example, a bona fide purchaser for value who has acquired rights). When rescission is available it can be accompanied by an equitable indemnity to require the representor to make restitutive payments where the innocent party cannot be fully restored by returning goods or money.

Damages operate differently. For fraudulent misrepresentation the innocent party can claim damages for deceit; these aim to compensate for losses flowing from the misrepresentation. For negligent misrepresentation, the claimant can seek damages under the common law of negligent misstatement where a duty arises, and statutory remedies may allow damages assessed on a similar basis to fraudulent cases, subject to statutory qualifications. For innocent misrepresentation the historic rule was that no damages were available as of right; however, equitable jurisdiction and statute permit courts in some cases to award damages in lieu of rescission where rescission would otherwise be available, giving the innocent party an alternative to unwinding the contract. In practice, the availability and quantification of damages depend closely on whether the misrepresentation was fraudulent, negligent, or innocent, and on statutory provisions that alter or supplement the common law position.

When considering remedies you should always ask whether the claimant is seeking to treat the contract as voidable and obtain rescission, or whether they prefer to affirm the contract and seek damages. A claimant who seeks damages in lieu of rescission may be able to obtain compensation without surrendering the contract, but the court’s discretion under equity and statute will determine the outcome.

## Economic duress and other vitiating factors
Economic duress is a separate, but often closely related, vitiating factor. It exists where a party is induced to enter into a contract (or to vary an existing contract) by illegitimate commercial pressure that leaves them with no practical alternative but to submit. The modern test asks whether the pressure applied was illegitimate and whether it deprived the victim of practical choice. Economic duress makes a transaction voidable: the innocent party can rescind and seek restitution. The remedy is similar to rescission for misrepresentation, although damages for duress may be available where losses arise and where the facts overlap with other causes of action.

Economic duress must be distinguished from legitimate commercial bargaining and from cases where pressure was accompanied by lawful threats or lawful economic pressure. The courts will scrutinise whether the conduct was illegitimate, whether the claimant protested or affirmed after the event, and whether there was a prompt attempt to rescind. Duress to the person and duress of goods are older categories that reflect physical compulsion; economic duress replaces and extends these doctrines in commercial contexts.

## Discharge of contract: performance, breach, agreement and frustration
Discharge refers to the various ways contractual obligations come to an end. The most ordinary route is discharge by performance: parties perform their contractual duties and the contract terminates by completion. Performance can be entire, where full completion of an obligation is required, or divisible, where obligations are severable. The courts will analyse whether a term is a condition, breach of which allows termination and damages, a warranty, breach of which gives damages only, or an innominate term, the breach of which may permit termination only if the breach is sufficiently serious in its consequences.

A contract can also be discharged by agreement. Parties may agree to rescind, vary or terminate their contract, and such consensual arrangements, properly formed, bring obligations to an end. Similarly, discharge by breach occurs where one party commits an actual breach or an anticipatory breach. Anticipatory breach occurs when, before performance is due, a party communicates an intention not to perform; the innocent party may accept the breach, terminate, and claim damages, or may wait to see if the repudiating party retracts.

Frustration is a special doctrine that discharges a contract where an unforeseen event, without fault of either party, renders performance impossible, illegal, or transforms obligations into something radically different from those contemplated at formation. The test for frustration is strict: frustration does not apply merely because performance becomes more difficult or expensive. Classic illustrations include destruction of the subject matter and supervening illegality. Where a contract is frustrated statutory and equitable rules govern the allocation of losses and any sums paid or payable prior to frustration.

## Remedies for breach of contract: damages and equitable relief
When a contract is breached the primary legal remedy is damages, with the general objective of placing the innocent party in the position they would have occupied had the contract been performed. Expectation damages compensate for lost benefits of the bargain, and their assessment requires consideration of causation, remoteness, and mitigation. The familiar test of remoteness asks whether losses were the kind that could reasonably be contemplated as arising from a breach at the time of contracting; if losses are too remote the court will not award compensation. The duty to mitigate requires the claimant to take reasonable steps to reduce loss; failure to mitigate will reduce recoverable damages.

Equitable remedies include specific performance, injunctions, rescission and rectification. Specific performance orders a party to perform its contractual obligation and is discretionary and exceptional; it is typically granted where damages would be an inadequate remedy, for example in contracts involving unique subject matter such as land. Injunctions prevent a party from acting in breach and are similarly discretionary. Rescission, already mentioned in the context of misrepresentation and duress, undoes the contract; rectification permits correction of the written contract to reflect the true agreement where a document fails to record accurately the parties’ intentions.

When advising on remedies you must match the remedy to the claimant’s objective: whether they seek to continue with the contract and obtain performance or whether they wish to terminate the bargain and secure monetary compensation. The courts will balance equitable considerations and legal principles, and they will not grant punitive remedies simply to punish a breaching party.

## Interaction, limits and practical considerations
In practice misrepresentation, discharge and remedies interact. A misrepresentation may lead to rescission; rescission may be prevented by third-party rights or by the passage of time; if rescission is barred the claimant may still seek damages if available. Similarly, an anticipatory breach may pre-empt a claim for misrepresentation by allowing the innocent party to terminate and sue for damages based on repudiation. Quantification of loss depends on the chosen remedy: tort measures may differ from contract expectation calculations. Statutory provisions and consumer protection legislation increasingly shape outcomes, particularly in consumer contexts where standard terms and exclusion clauses face control under reasonableness tests and statutory limitations.

When considering practical scenarios, think about the availability of remedies at the time the claimant acts. Prompt action preserves options: an immediate repudiation and claim often preserves the right to rescind. Seek factual clarity about reliance and causation, because if the claimant did not rely on the misrepresentation, or if their loss was not caused by it, remedies will be limited. Finally, consider restitutionary obligations: where rescission is granted, courts will require repayment or return of benefits so that unjust enrichment is avoided.

## Exam technique
In examinations always structure answers clearly and apply the law to the facts. Begin by identifying the legal issues and state the relevant legal rules and definitions. Use a problem‑question format: set out the law, then apply it point by point to the facts, and finally reach a reasoned conclusion. Where statutory rules apply, explain their effect in simple terms and note any important defences or bars. Remember to consider alternative remedies and the practical consequences of choosing one remedy over another. Demonstrate evaluation by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of possible outcomes and by acknowledging factual uncertainties. Time management is crucial: allocate time in proportion to the marks, and ensure you leave time for a clear conclusion. Refer to leading authorities and key tests where appropriate to show legal knowledge, but focus your marks on accurate application and reasoned evaluation rather than excessive case‑naming.
