# Map, Graph and GIS Skills (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: why these skills matter
Map, graph and GIS skills sit at the heart of GCSE Geography because they are the practical tools geographers use to collect, represent and make sense of spatial information. Whether you are describing a river valley, analysing coastal change, investigating migration flows or carrying out fieldwork, being confident with maps, graphs and digital mapping will let you turn observations into convincing, evidence-based explanations. The exam and non-exam assessment (NEA) expect you to use a range of cartographic, numerical and graphical techniques, to select and apply suitable field methods, and to evaluate the reliability and limitations of your evidence. Practise these skills deliberately: they are transferable across units and will improve your answers wherever geographical data are involved.

## Ordnance Survey maps and map reading
Ordnance Survey (OS) maps are the classic paper maps you will use for locating places, planning fieldwork and interpreting landscape features. Learn to read map symbols, to spot the scale and north arrow, and to use the map key so that features such as railways, woodland, built-up areas and different road types are clear. Interpreting an OS map means reading shape and pattern: the layout of streets, the spread of housing, the relationship between rivers and land uses, and the distribution of physical features like cliffs or contour lines. Recognising land use zones—such as central business districts, suburbs and industrial estates—helps you describe human geography at a range of scales. When you use maps in the field or in the exam, always be specific about which map edition or scale you are using and explain how the spatial patterns you see relate to physical or human processes.

## Grid references, scale and measuring distance
Being precise about location is fundamental. A four-figure grid reference gives you the 1 km square in which a feature lies; a six-figure grid reference pinpoints it to 100 metres. To build accuracy in fieldwork and exam answers, practise writing and interpreting both types so you can locate sampling sites, river features or coastal landforms reliably. Scale converts the map to real-world distance. If a map has the scale 1:50 000, one unit on the map equals 50 000 of the same units on the ground, so 2 cm represents 1 km. Using the scale line is the most reliable method on paper maps: measure the distance with a ruler or trundle wheel, convert using the scale, and remember to include units in your answer. When estimating area, count squares or use the scale to estimate lengths and multiply; when precise area is needed for fieldwork analysis, explain any assumptions you made. Practice converting map measurements into real distances, and remember that straight-line (as-the-crow-flies) distance differs from route distance, which follows a path or river course and is usually longer.

## Contours, slopes and cross-sections
Contour lines on a map link points of equal elevation and are the key to understanding relief. Close contours indicate steep slopes and widely spaced contours indicate gentle gradients. Interpreting contours allows you to identify features such as ridges, valleys, spurs, saddles and summits. To quantify slope, use the gradient formula: gradient = rise/run. For example, if a contour interval shows a rise of 50 metres over a horizontal distance measured as 250 metres on the ground, the gradient is 50/250 or 1:5, which you can express as a percentage (20%) if required. Drawing cross-sections turns a map into a side-on profile: transfer points along a transect onto graph paper using the vertical scale exaggerated if necessary to show relief clearly. Cross-sections and transects are often used in fieldwork to demonstrate changes in channel width, beach profile or vegetation zones. In your lab notes and exam answers, describe how relief and aspect influence processes such as drainage, erosion, microclimates or land use, and use numerical gradient calculations to support your explanations.

## Sampling, field data collection and equipment
Good fieldwork starts with careful planning. The six-stage enquiry model—question, context, plan, collect, process, evaluate—is a practical framework. The question you pose should be specific, measurable and geographically focussed so that your chosen methods will produce useful evidence. Selecting locations requires thought about representativeness and accessibility; sampling decisions affect reliability. Random sampling reduces bias, systematic sampling along a transect shows spatial change, stratified sampling ensures different land use types are represented, and opportunistic sampling can be useful but must be justified if used. When collecting primary data, use suitable equipment and record methods precisely. For quantitative data you might use tape measures, clinometers, flow meters or quadrats; for qualitative data you could use structured interviews, field sketches or photographs. Design data sheets that include clear variable names, units and sample identifiers. In addition to primary data, secondary sources such as census tables, topographic surveys or online GIS datasets can add important context; always evaluate their reliability, date and potential bias. Prioritise safety and ethical considerations: carry out risk assessments, obtain permission when working on private land, respect people’s privacy when interviewing, and be inclusive in your sampling to avoid excluding groups or viewpoints.

## Presenting and analysing data: graphs, statistics and GIS
Presenting data clearly helps you to interpret patterns and trends. Choose the appropriate graph for your data: line graphs and multi-line graphs are ideal for time series such as temperature or river discharge; bar charts compare discrete categories such as land use types; scatter plots reveal relationships between two variables and allow you to draw trend lines and make cautious predictions. For spatial data, choropleth maps use shading to show intensity across areas, while flow maps use arrows of varying width to show movement, such as migration or traffic flows. When constructing graphs, select sensible scales that use most of the plotting area, label axes with units and include a title that explains what the graph shows. Basic statistical measures are essential: the mean, median and mode describe central tendency; the range and interquartile range describe spread; and percentage change and ratios help compare places and times. For bivariate data, describe correlation and avoid implying causation without further evidence. Always comment on the reliability of your data, noting sources of error such as measurement precision, small sample sizes or biased samples. When referencing secondary data, include a clear bibliography or source list; explain whether data are up to date and whether the collecting organisation might have a vested interest.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing extend your analytical toolkit. GIS allows you to overlay layers such as land use, elevation, flood risk and population to explore relationships and to perform simple spatial analysis like buffering or calculating densities. Remote sensing from satellites or aerial photos is invaluable for identifying land cover, coastline change or urban expansion. When interpreting satellite images, consider scale, resolution, vegetation signatures, seasonal differences and man-made features. Be aware of limitations: projection distortions can affect area and distance, and different datasets may use varying classification schemes. In the exam you may be asked to interpret screenshots from a GIS; describe what layers show, suggest plausible reasons for patterns, and, where possible, propose further data or analysis that would test your ideas.

## Exam technique
Answer the question that is asked. Read the question carefully, identify command words such as describe, explain, suggest or evaluate, and structure your response to meet the mark criteria. When a question involves maps, always name the map and scale if provided, give precise locations with grid references where appropriate and use compass directions to describe patterns. For calculations, show all working clearly and label units; examiners award method marks even if the final answer is incorrect, so write down each step when converting distances, calculating gradient or finding mean and median. When presenting data in the exam, sketch simple graphs clearly, use appropriate scales and annotate trends or anomalies; in longer answers integrate numerical evidence from graphs or maps to support explanations. If a question asks about reliability or limitations, be specific: discuss sample size, measurement precision, date of data, spatial coverage and possible sources of bias, and suggest practical improvements such as increasing samples, using stratified sampling or combining primary and higher-quality secondary data.

Time management matters. Tackle longer, higher-mark questions earlier when you are fresh and leave shorter or lower-mark items to the end. Allocate time proportional to marks available and use the last few minutes to check calculations, unit labels and that you have answered every part of the question. In NEA work such as the fieldwork enquiry and decision making exercise, present your methods clearly, justify your choices and include evaluative comments throughout rather than leaving all evaluation to the end. Annotate maps, include labelled photographs or sketches if they add clarity, and ensure all secondary sources are referenced. Finally, practise these skills under exam conditions and in real fieldwork settings: familiarity with map scales, drawing cross-sections, plotting and interpreting graphs, and using simple GIS outputs will make these skills feel automatic in the exam and will raise the quality and credibility of your geographical arguments.
