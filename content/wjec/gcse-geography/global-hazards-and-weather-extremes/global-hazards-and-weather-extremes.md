# Global Hazards and Weather Extremes (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Understanding weather, climate and the big-picture circulation
Weather describes the short-term state of the atmosphere in a place — the temperature, wind, cloud and precipitation experienced day to day — while climate is the average of those conditions over longer periods (typically 30 years or more). The pattern of temperature and rainfall across Wales and the UK is shaped by a mix of factors: latitude, which controls how much solar energy a location receives; altitude, which generally cools the air with height; aspect, which affects sun exposure on slopes; ocean currents, which can warm or cool coastal regions; and prevailing winds, which bring air with particular temperature and moisture characteristics.

At the global scale, the atmosphere is organised into three broad circulation cells in each hemisphere: the Hadley cell near the equator, the Ferrel cell in the mid-latitudes and the Polar cell nearer the poles. Rising air at the equator and sinking air in the subtropics create zones of low and high pressure that, together with the Earth's rotation, set up major wind belts and influence where deserts, rainforests and temperate storm tracks occur. Seasonal changes in solar heating caused by the tilt of the Earth’s axis also shift these circulation patterns, changing where storms and dry spells happen at different times of year. Understanding these large-scale systems helps explain why certain kinds of extreme weather tend to occur in particular places and seasons.

Rainfall itself is produced by three main processes. Convectional rainfall occurs where the surface heats strongly and warm air rises to cool and condense, producing short, intense showers and thunderstorms. Relief (or orographic) rainfall happens when air is forced to rise over mountains, cooling and dropping moisture on the windward side. Frontal rainfall is associated with the meeting of different air masses — the warm, moist air rises over cooler air along fronts and produces widespread, often prolonged precipitation. These processes, combined with local geography, determine whether an area is likely to experience heavy storms, prolonged rain or drought.

## Low pressure systems and extreme low-pressure hazards
Low pressure systems occur where air is rising. In the mid-latitudes, rising air is organised into depressions or cyclones that commonly move from west to east with the prevailing winds. These systems bring cloud, strong winds and frontal rainfall. The structure of a depression includes warm and cold fronts where contrasting air masses meet; the passage of fronts is often marked by dramatic changes in wind direction, temperature and precipitation.

At the global scale, more intense low-pressure systems include extra-tropical cyclones (the familiar mid-latitude storms) and tropical cyclones (known by different names such as hurricanes, typhoons or cyclones depending on the ocean basin). Tropical cyclones form over warm tropical oceans where sea surface temperatures and moist air provide energy, and where low vertical wind shear allows the storm to organise and strengthen. When such systems reach land, impacts can be catastrophic: coastal storm surge, intense rainfall causing flash floods and landslides, widespread wind damage to buildings and infrastructure, and disruption to water and power supplies.

The human and environmental impacts of extreme low-pressure events are wide-ranging. Socially, communities can suffer loss of life, injury and displacement; economically, the costs of damage to homes, transport and industry can be enormous; environmentally, storms can erode coasts, damage habitats and cause pollution from damaged infrastructure. Responses to these hazards operate at different stages: immediate emergency action such as search and rescue and temporary shelters; short-term measures like restoring power and clearing roads; and longer-term mitigation through flood and coastal defence schemes, land-use planning that avoids building in high-risk zones, and improvements to building standards. The sustainability of these responses depends on funding, maintenance, and whether they consider future climate-driven changes to hazard frequency and intensity.

## High pressure systems, heatwaves and droughts
High pressure systems, or anticyclones, form where air sinks, leading to clearer skies, light winds and relatively stable conditions. In winter, anticyclones can produce clear, cold weather with fog and frost, whereas in summer they can produce prolonged periods of hot, dry weather that lead to heatwaves and droughts. Heatwaves under strong and persistent anticyclones are dangerous because clear skies, intense solar heating and stagnant air combine to push daytime temperatures high and keep nights warm, reducing people’s ability to recover.

The consequences of extreme high-pressure events include severe impacts on health, especially for the very young, elderly and those with existing medical conditions; increased demand for emergency services; strain on water supplies and agriculture; wildfires in dry landscapes; and damage to infrastructure designed for cooler temperatures. Cities are particularly vulnerable because the urban heat island effect makes them hotter than surrounding rural areas, increasing heat stress. Responses to heatwaves and droughts include immediate public health measures such as opening cooling centres and issuing heat-health warnings, medium-term strategies such as water use restrictions and improved irrigation for agriculture, and long-term planning that includes green infrastructure (trees, parks) to cool urban areas and sustainable water resource management. As with flood defences, the sustainability of these measures depends on forward-looking planning and investment.

## How climate change is altering weather extremes
Earth’s climate has changed naturally over geological time scales due to processes such as variations in the Earth’s orbit (Milankovitch cycles), volcanic eruptions that inject aerosols into the stratosphere and changes in solar activity. However, since the industrial era, human activities have increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and warming the planet. Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and clearing forests, methane from agriculture and waste, and nitrous oxide from industrial processes have driven recent warming.

This warming influences weather extremes in several ways. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which increases the potential for heavier rainfall and more intense storms. Rising sea temperatures can fuel more powerful tropical cyclones. Higher baseline temperatures make heatwaves more likely and more severe. At the same time, changes in atmospheric circulation can alter the tracks and behaviour of depressions and anticyclones, sometimes leading to more persistent blocking patterns that cause long dry spells or extended periods of wet weather. Scientists use observations — such as melting glaciers, rising sea levels, retreating sea ice and the global temperature record — alongside attribution studies to show that many recent extreme events were made more likely or more severe by human-induced climate change.

The consequences of a changing climate are therefore not just shifts in averages but increases in extremes: more intense downpours, deeper droughts, stronger storms and hotter heatwaves. These changes create challenges for societies, infrastructure and ecosystems, and they raise questions about fairness and responsibility because the countries and communities least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts.

## Managing hazards: mitigation, adaptation and sustainable responses
Managing weather extremes requires a mix of mitigation (reducing the causes) and adaptation (reducing the impacts). Mitigation operates at national and global scales and includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy, energy efficiency and protecting and restoring forests. Agreements and targets that aim to limit global warming are part of this long-term response.

Adaptation is about living with the changes that are already happening or are unavoidable. This includes building resilient infrastructure, designing floodplains and coasts to absorb storm surge, retrofitting buildings to withstand stronger winds and heat, and planning water resources to withstand drought. Early warning systems are a cost-effective adaptation tool: accurate meteorological forecasting and clear communication to the public greatly reduce loss of life during storms and heatwaves. Nature-based solutions — restoring wetlands to store floodwater, planting trees to reduce urban heat, and conserving coastal habitats that reduce wave energy — often provide multiple social and environmental benefits and can be more sustainable than hard engineering alone.

Decisions about which strategies to use should consider long-term sustainability, equity and the likely future changes in hazard patterns. For example, constructing sea walls protects particular stretches of coast but can be expensive, require continuous maintenance and cause problems elsewhere by changing sediment movement. Alternatives such as managed retreat, where communities move away from the most vulnerable zones, raise difficult social and economic questions but may be necessary in some places.

## Case studies that illustrate extremes and responses
Looking at specific events helps to make the abstract ideas concrete. The 2013 Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines was one of the most intense tropical cyclones ever recorded at landfall. It brought catastrophic storm surge, extreme winds and heavy rainfall that caused thousands of deaths, widespread displacement and enormous damage to housing and infrastructure. The response involved international humanitarian aid, local emergency relief, and long-term rebuilding efforts. The event highlighted the vulnerability of low-lying coastal communities, the importance of early warning and evacuation planning, and the need to consider increasingly severe storms in future land-use and coastal defence planning.

On the high-pressure side, the 2003 European heatwave provides a contrasting example. Prolonged high temperatures across much of Europe caused tens of thousands of excess deaths, particularly among older people, and significant impacts on agriculture, transport and energy systems. The heatwave exposed weaknesses in public health preparedness and urban design. In response, some European countries implemented heat-health action plans, improved surveillance of vulnerable groups, and invested in measures to make buildings and cities more resilient to extreme heat.

These two examples show how different atmospheric systems produce different hazards, and they underline the importance of combining emergency response, longer-term planning and efforts to reduce the underlying drivers of change.

## Using data and skills to study extremes
Interpreting weather and climate requires the use of a range of geographical skills. Synoptic charts and satellite imagery allow meteorologists to track depressions, fronts and tropical systems; climate graphs and hydrographs show seasonal and event-based changes in temperature and precipitation; and long-term datasets such as temperature records, ice-core data and sea-level measurements give evidence for climate trends. In fieldwork and decision-making exercises, students might use maps to identify at-risk locations, calculate return periods for floods, analyse trends from time-series data and assess the reliability of secondary sources. Being able to evaluate graphical information, appreciate uncertainty and consider multiple scales — local, national and global — is central to understanding and communicating about weather extremes.

## Exam technique
When answering questions about global hazards and weather extremes, start by making sure you address the command word in the question directly: describe, explain, assess or evaluate. For describe questions, focus on clear factual detail or the sequence of events. For explain questions, develop causes and link them to consequences; use geographical terms such as “air mass”, “frontal rainfall”, “anticyclone” and “storm surge”. For assess or evaluate questions, weigh different viewpoints or responses and make a judgement based on evidence. Use specific examples where possible, name events or places, and relate your answers to scale — local versus global — and to the concepts of mitigation and adaptation. Where data is provided, refer to the data explicitly: quote figures, describe trends and link them to physical processes. Finally, check your spelling of key terms and make sure each paragraph addresses a single idea to make your argument clear and easy to follow.
