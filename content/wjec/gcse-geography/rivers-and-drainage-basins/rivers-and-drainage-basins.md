# Rivers and Drainage Basins (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: the hydrological cycle and the drainage basin concept
Rivers and drainage basins are central to physical geography because they show how water moves across and through the landscape. At the largest scale water moves in the global hydrological cycle, a closed system in which energy from the Sun drives evaporation, atmospheric transport and precipitation. Within this global cycle, a drainage basin acts as an open system: it has inputs such as precipitation, outputs such as river discharge to the sea or to groundwater outflow, stores including soil moisture and groundwater, and transfers such as overland flow, throughflow and channel flow. Thinking in terms of inputs, stores, transfers and outputs helps to explain why rivers vary in flow over time and why particular landforms develop in particular places.

A drainage basin is the area of land drained by a single river and its tributaries, bounded by the watershed or drainage divide. Key features to know are the source where the river begins, the mouth where it enters the sea or another river, tributaries which join the main channel, confluences where two streams meet, the channel itself and adjacent floodplain. Understanding these components is the first step to explaining how rivers shape the landscape and how people interact with rivers.

## Stores and flows in the drainage basin; seasonal variation
Within a drainage basin, water is stored temporarily in a variety of places. Interception storage is held on vegetation and buildings, surface storage occurs in puddles and ponds, soil stores hold moisture for plant use, and groundwater stores contain water in pore spaces and fissures in rocks. Transfers between these stores include infiltration into soil, percolation into deeper rock, throughflow within the soil, overland flow when infiltration capacity is exceeded, and channel flow within the river itself.

The amount of water in a drainage basin varies seasonally and after individual storms. In winter or during prolonged rainfall soil is often saturated so a greater proportion of precipitation becomes runoff, while in dry seasons more water is retained in soil and less reaches the river. In cold climates or upland areas, snow can act as a temporary store and sudden thaw causes rapid transfer into the river system, increasing flood risk. Being able to describe seasonal patterns and explain them in terms of stores and flows is a useful way to link theory to real rivers.

## Processes: weathering, erosion, transportation and deposition
Rivers work through a combination of processes that reshape landscapes over time. Weathering breaks down rock in place by physical, chemical and biological means. Erosion removes material from the channel and banks and takes several forms. Hydraulic action occurs when the force of moving water dislodges particles and widens cracks; abrasion happens when material carried by the river rubs and grinds bed and banks like sandpaper; attrition is the breaking down of rock fragments as they collide; and solution (corrosion) dissolves soluble minerals in the water.

Material eroded by a river is carried downstream by different modes of transportation. Traction moves the largest particles along the bed by rolling and sliding; saltation describes a series of short jumps by sand and gravel; suspension carries fine particles such as silt and clay within the water column; and solution transports dissolved materials invisibly in the water. When river velocity drops, energy reduces and material is deposited. Sorting of sediments commonly occurs, with the heaviest transported the shortest distance and finer materials travelling further, leading to characteristic layers in river deposits.

## River profiles and landform development: from source to mouth
The long profile of a river, from steep upland source to lowland mouth, typically shows a concave shape with steep gradients in the upper course becoming gentle in the lower course. Cross profiles change too: channels in the upper course are narrow and deep or shallow and rocky, while in the lower course channels are wider and deeper with extensive floodplains.

In the upper course, vertical erosion dominates and the river cuts down into bedrock creating features such as waterfalls and gorges. Waterfalls develop where resistant rock overlies softer rock; the softer rock is eroded more quickly, forming a plunge pool at the base and undercutting the overhang until collapse causes the waterfall to retreat, leaving a steep-sided gorge behind. An example of dramatic upland waterfalls in Wales is Pistyll Rhaeadr, where geological contrasts create a high drop.

In the middle and lower courses lateral erosion and deposition become more important. Meanders form when variations in flow across a channel create faster flow around bends and slower flow on the inside of bends. Faster flow produces erosion on the outer bank, forming a river cliff, while slower flow causes deposition on the inner bank, building a slip-off slope. Over time these meanders can become extremely sinuous and, during floods or when the neck between two meander loops narrows sufficiently, the river may cut a new, shorter channel and leave behind an oxbow lake. Repeated flooding and deposition of silt and fine sediment create floodplains and natural levees adjacent to the channel; these are fertile, flat areas prized for agriculture.

## Factors controlling river processes and landforms
Several natural and human factors influence how rivers behave and the landforms they create. Discharge, the volume of water passing a point per unit time, is a primary control: higher discharge increases erosive power and the river’s ability to transport larger sediments. Channel gradient or slope determines the energy available for erosion; steep gradients encourage vertical cutting and formation of rapids and waterfalls, while gentle gradients promote lateral erosion and meander formation. Geology is central because rock type and structure determine how easily banks and bed can be eroded; resistant rocks such as igneous or well-cemented sandstone produce waterfalls and cliffs, while softer rocks like clays erode to produce wider valleys.

River velocity varies across a channel and along the long profile and controls the dominant processes. Vegetation, soil type and land use in the catchment also affect how much water reaches the river and how quickly. Urban surfaces and compacted agricultural soils reduce infiltration and increase surface runoff, causing flashier hydrographs with higher peak flows and shorter lag times after storms. In contrast, forested catchments increase interception and infiltration, slowing transfer to the channel and reducing flood peaks.

## Flooding, hydrographs and human impacts
Flooding is one of the major ways rivers affect people and is caused when river discharge exceeds channel capacity. The storm hydrograph is a useful tool to understand river response to rainfall; it shows the variation in discharge over time after a storm, highlighting the rising limb, peak discharge, falling limb and baseflow. The timing and shape of the hydrograph are influenced by catchment size, shape, slope, land use and antecedent conditions. Small, steep, urbanised catchments tend to have short lag times and high peaks, producing sudden, local floods, whereas larger, flatter catchments produce lower, delayed peaks.

Human activities both benefit from and increase the risks associated with rivers. Floodplains are attractive for farming because of the fertile alluvial soils, and settlements have historically grown beside rivers for transport, water supply and industry. Rivers generate energy through hydroelectric schemes in upland areas, such as the hydroelectric developments in parts of Wales, and waterfalls and scenic valleys attract tourists, which supports local economies. At the same time hard engineering solutions like concrete channelisation and embankments can reduce local flooding but transfer problems downstream, alter habitats and reduce the river’s ability to maintain natural processes. Urbanisation, deforestation and poorly planned development increase runoff and flood risk, while pollution and abstraction can reduce water quality and flow.

## River management: hard, soft and sustainable approaches
When rivers threaten people or property, a range of management responses is possible and these vary in sustainability. Hard engineering options such as dams, flood embankments, levees and channel straightening provide strong, immediate protection and can control water for reservoirs and hydroelectricity, but they are expensive, can disturb ecosystems and often require long-term maintenance. Soft engineering seeks to work with natural processes by using floodplain zoning to restrict development, restoring wetlands to store floodwater, re-meandering straightened channels, and creating upstream afforestation or leaky woody dams to slow runoff.

Sustainable river management increasingly favours a mix of approaches that balance human needs with environmental health. Natural flood management techniques such as planting trees in headwaters, restoring peatlands, reconnecting rivers to their floodplains and creating washlands allow rivers to attenuate flows naturally, reduce downstream flood risk and improve biodiversity. Decisions about river management should consider short- and long-term costs, social impacts including possible displacement, and environmental consequences. When discussing management in an exam or fieldwork write-up, always consider the sustainability of an option and whether it treats the symptom or the cause of flooding.

## Fieldwork and applying the ideas: measuring and interpreting rivers
Fieldwork is a key way to understand rivers. Simple, reliable measurements include channel cross-sectional area and velocity, which together give discharge using the relationship discharge equals cross-sectional area multiplied by mean velocity. Measuring channel sediment size with a pebble count helps to link erosion and transport to observed landforms. Collecting qualitative evidence such as bank material, vegetation cover and human structures provides context for quantitative data and strengthens interpretation.

Comparing primary field measurements with secondary sources such as rainfall records, land-use maps or historical flood records supports more robust explanations for observed patterns. Processing field data into graphs and annotated sketches makes trends clear; for example, a downstream increase in channel width and a change in sediment size from large boulders to fine sand can be displayed and explained using knowledge of energy and transport processes. When planning fieldwork remember safety and ethical considerations, obtain appropriate permissions and think about sampling strategies so that data are representative and valid.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on rivers and drainage basins, begin by using precise geographical terminology such as drainage basin, watershed, discharge, hydraulic action, abrasion, solution, meander, oxbow lake, floodplain and baseflow. For process questions, describe step-by-step how the process works and then explain the landforms that result. For example, explain how differences in rock resistance and water flow cause waterfall formation, and then link to the resulting gorge formation through repeated undercutting and collapse. Always link cause and effect: if urbanisation is given as a factor, explain how reduced infiltration increases overland flow, produces a steeper rising limb on a hydrograph and raises peak discharge.

Where examples are useful, name a real river or place and give brief, relevant details such as its landforms or a management scheme; specific examples make answers more convincing. When interpreting diagrams like hydrographs or long profiles, describe the pattern and then explain it using the processes and factors you have learned. In evaluative questions compare alternatives and consider short-term and long-term consequences, costs and benefits, and the environmental and social impacts of options. For longer answers structure your response with a clear introduction to the issue, a middle section of explanation and evidence, and a brief concluding judgement that justifies your final view. Finally, in fieldwork or decision-making style questions refer to methods, reliability, validity and ethical considerations, and always justify your choices of data, sampling and techniques.
