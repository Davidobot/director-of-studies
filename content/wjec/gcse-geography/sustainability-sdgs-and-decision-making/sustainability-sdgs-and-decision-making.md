# Sustainability, SDGs and Decision Making (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction
Sustainability and decision making sit at the heart of contemporary geography because they ask the central question: how can people meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs? In the WJEC / Eduqas GCSE specification this idea appears explicitly in Unit 4, Sustainable Solutions, and threads through other units where human and physical systems interact. This revision guide explains the key concepts you must understand, shows how the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) connect to local and global geography, and sets out practical ways to research, evaluate and justify sustainable choices. Examples and short case studies bring ideas to life and help you practise the skills you will use in the unitised decision making exercise.

## What sustainability means: the three pillars
Sustainability is best thought of as a balance between three linked pillars: environmental, economic and social. The environmental pillar asks whether a proposed action conserves or damages ecosystems, biodiversity and resources. The economic pillar considers whether an option is financially viable in the short and long term, whether it creates jobs or displaces livelihoods. The social pillar looks at people: does the option respect human rights, improve quality of life, support diversity and community cohesion, and is it fair across different groups? These pillars are interdependent; a solution that is strong on one pillar but weak on the others is unlikely to be truly sustainable. For example, a new dam may generate clean energy and boost the economy, but if it displaces communities and destroys habitats the social and environmental costs may outweigh the economic benefits. In GCSE work you will often be asked to weigh these kinds of trade-offs and to explain why a particular option is the most sustainable overall.

## The Sustainable Development Goals and connections to Wales
The 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a practical framework for thinking about sustainability at multiple scales. Goals such as SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) are especially relevant to many GCSE geography topics. The SDGs link neatly with Wales’s Well-being of Future Generations Act and its seven well-being goals, so when you are considering local or Welsh case studies you can show how global aims translate into national and local action. For example, managing coastal erosion can be framed through SDG 14, but also through SDG 11 when towns and infrastructure are at risk, and through SDG 8 if tourism or fishing livelihoods are affected. Using SDGs in your decision making gives clear, recognisable criteria to judge options and makes it easier to explain why one choice supports broader targets for people and planet.

## Gathering and using evidence
Strong decisions are grounded in evidence. In Unit 4 you will be given a Resource Pack and asked to research further before the timed assessment. Effective research starts by identifying what you need to know: physical data such as topography, flood risk or ecosystem condition; and human data such as population, employment, land ownership and community views. When using secondary sources, always consider reliability. Sources with a clear vested interest—developers promoting a scheme, or a campaign group with a single message—may present information selectively. Look for balanced reports, government or academic data, and where possible compare multiple sources. Referencing is essential: make brief notes of your sources and include a short bibliography to show where facts and figures came from. In the assessment you are allowed to prepare up to two sides of A4 research notes, so practise synthesising key facts, maps and statistics into concise, well-referenced prompts you can use during the timed tasks.

## Weighing benefits and harms: sustainability impact assessment
When you evaluate options, think in terms of benefits, negative impacts and how sustainable those effects will be over time. A sustainability impact assessment does not have to be complicated. You will consider social, economic and environmental effects for each option and judge whether they are short-term or long-term, reversible or permanent, and who gains or loses. It helps to use simple comparative tools during revision: give clear, evidence-based statements about likely outcomes, explain the scale of those outcomes, and where possible quantify impacts (for example, estimated number of homes protected, jobs created or hectares of habitat lost). Consider stakeholders and power: who makes the decisions, who bears the costs, and whose voices are heard? Human rights and diversity are important here—solutions must respect the rights of vulnerable groups and aim for fair distribution of benefits. Remember that trade-offs are usually unavoidable; your task is to show that you can weigh them fairly and explain the reasoning behind the final choice.

## Making and communicating a sustainable decision
A good decision follows a clear line of reasoning that moves from evidence to options to evaluation and finally a justified recommendation. Start by defining the issue succinctly: where is the problem, what geographic processes are involved, and why does it matter now? Lay out realistic options and make sure each option is described in enough detail for the examiner to understand how it would work. Use the SDGs and the three pillars as criteria to compare options, and include both immediate effects and longer-term consequences. If you reject an option, explain why with reference to evidence; weak or unworkable ideas should be dismissed for clear reasons rather than simply ignored. Communicate your conclusion with a firm recommendation that explains who benefits, who might lose out, how it supports sustainability goals, and how you would monitor or review the decision over time. Including a short note on implementation—timescale, likely costs, and key partners—adds credibility and shows you can think beyond theory to practical delivery.

## Practical examples and common scenarios
Practise with familiar scenarios to build confidence. For coastal management imagine a small seaside town with increasing erosion. One option might be to build hard sea defences to "hold the line", protecting properties and businesses in the short term but disrupting sediment flows, harming beach ecosystems and costing taxpayers. An alternative might be managed realignment, which allows low-lying land to flood, creating new habitats while accepting some short-term loss of land uses. Assess these options using evidence: coastal maps, historical rates of erosion, economic value of tourism, and local community views. For urban decision making, consider whether to redevelop a brownfield site for housing or to expand into greenfield land on the city edge. Use demographic data, transport access, and environmental sensitivity to evaluate sustainability. For climate mitigation, compare investing in local renewable energy projects such as community solar or wind against importing energy through national grids; weigh carbon reduction potential alongside social acceptability, cost and long-term resilience. As you practise, focus on clear description, linked evidence, balanced evaluation and a well-argued final choice.

## Exam technique
Approach the Unit 4 decision making exercise as a structured problem to solve under time constraints. In Phase 1 use your research time to gather and reference the most relevant facts, noting figures, maps and stakeholder positions on your two sides of A4. During the timed assessment begin with a concise statement of the issue and the scale of the problem, then describe the reasonable options available. For each option provide clear, evidence-based analysis of social, economic and environmental impacts, making sure to discuss sustainability and equity. Use the SDGs and the three pillars as organising criteria to show breadth of thinking. When you reach your recommendation, explain why this option is the best overall, show that you have considered and rejected alternatives for good reasons, and outline how the decision could be implemented and monitored. Keep your writing focused and avoid unnecessary repetition; examiners are looking for logical structure, relevant evidence and sound judgement. Finally, practise under timed conditions with past-style resource packs, build concise annotated notes you can rely on, and get used to referencing secondary data succinctly so your evidence has weight and credibility.
