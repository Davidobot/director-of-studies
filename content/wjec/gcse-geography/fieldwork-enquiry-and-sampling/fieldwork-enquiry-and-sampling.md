# Fieldwork Enquiry and Sampling (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Why fieldwork matters and how Unit 2 is assessed
Fieldwork is where geography becomes active: instead of only reading about places and processes, you go out, collect real evidence and use the tools and techniques geographers use in practice. In the WJEC / Eduqas GCSE this practical work is assessed in Unit 2, Developing Fieldwork Skills. The externally set tasks require you to follow a six‑stage enquiry model and to produce an enquiry that shows planning, data collection, processing, analysis, conclusions and evaluation. The assignment is worth 25% of the qualification, is marked out of 90 marks, and should be completed in seven hours of supervised assessment time (this excludes the time taken to carry out the fieldwork itself). Centres must undertake the fieldwork on a day outside the classroom and submit a signed fieldwork statement giving date, location and nature of the visit. Understanding the whole process and being able to justify choices is as important as collecting accurate data.

## The six-stage enquiry model and planning well
Successful fieldwork begins with careful planning underpinned by the six-stage enquiry model: choose a focused topic, pose clear enquiry questions, plan the methods and locations, collect evidence, process and present that evidence, then analyse, conclude and evaluate. Planning starts with a clear rationale: what geographical concept or problem are you investigating and why does it matter? Time, access and equipment are practical constraints that help shape a realistic enquiry. Using maps and Ordnance Survey (OS) products to locate study sites, with correct scale, north arrow and four- or six-figure grid references, helps make your plan reproducible and transparent. You should also prepare a risk assessment and consider ethical issues and inclusion so that your fieldwork respects participants and the environment. When preparing, think about the data you will need to answer your question and how you will collect, record and store it.

## Posing clear, measurable enquiry questions and hypotheses
A strong enquiry question is specific, measurable and framed in geographical terms. Instead of asking a very broad question such as “Why do people move?” a fieldwork question should be focused and testable, for example “How does pedestrian flow (people per minute) vary along the High Street between 09:00 and 15:00?” or “How does pebble size change along the beach from east to west?” Your question may be directional, predicting an increase or decrease, or non‑directional, simply testing whether a difference exists. Good practice is to present an explicit hypothesis or predicted outcome and justify it using prior geographical knowledge: reference processes, relevant theory or local context to explain why you expect a particular result. This strengthens the links between the fieldwork and wider geographical understanding.

## Choosing locations and sampling: representativeness and inclusivity
Choosing where to collect data is as important as what you collect. Sampling is the strategy you use to select locations or participants, and your choice must be justified. Representative sampling aims to capture the variation within the study area, and the main techniques you may use include random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling and opportunistic sampling. Random sampling avoids selection bias but can be logistically difficult; systematic sampling, where you sample at regular intervals or along a transect, is easy to carry out and useful for studying change with distance; stratified sampling ensures you include all key categories (for example different land uses in an urban study); opportunistic sampling uses available participants or sites and is acceptable only when constraints make other methods impossible, but its limitations must be acknowledged. Sample size is a balance between statistical reliability and practical constraints: larger samples are generally more reliable but require more time. Always consider accessibility and inclusion so that your sample reflects the diversity of the place or population you are studying and so that data collection does not disadvantage any group.

## Collecting data: primary and secondary methods and equipment
Primary data are those you collect yourself in the field. Quantitative primary methods include measurements such as channel width and depth, flow velocity, pebble size, transect counts of land uses, sound level readings and structured questionnaires that yield numerical responses. Qualitative primary methods include semi‑structured interviews, focus groups, participant observation, field sketches and photographs that record context and meaning. Practical equipment commonly used in GCSE fieldwork includes tape measures, clinometers, flow meters or timing sticks for velocity, quadrats and sampling frames for vegetation studies, pebble sieves, thermometers, turbidity tubes, GPS devices or mobile phones for coordinates, sound meters and cameras. Secondary data come from existing sources such as census data, local authority reports, online GIS layers and historical maps. These sources can provide useful context, allow comparison with primary findings and extend the spatial or temporal scale of your enquiry, but you must evaluate their reliability and potential bias. Always record full source details so you can reference secondary data accurately.

## Processing, presenting and basic statistical techniques
Raw data must be processed into forms that reveal patterns and support interpretation. Calculations commonly used include measures of central tendency such as mean and median, measures of spread such as range and interquartile range, percentages and simple rates, and derived values such as discharge (cross‑sectional area multiplied by velocity). Map‑based calculations, such as measuring distance using the map scale or converting grid references, are essential when working with OS maps. Presentation choices matter because different graphs and maps suit different data types. Time series and hydrographs show changes through time, scatter plots and correlation diagrams reveal relationships between two variables, bar charts compare categories, histograms and frequency graphs show distributions, and choropleth maps or flow maps reveal spatial patterns. Modern fieldwork also benefits from simple GIS screenshots to display spatial data. When selecting presentation methods, explain why each was chosen and be ready to comment on strengths and weaknesses, such as how a scatter plot may suggest correlation but not prove causation.

## Analysing data, drawing conclusions and evaluating methods
Analysis goes beyond description: it identifies trends, tests whether the data support the hypothesis, synthesises primary and secondary evidence, and links findings back to geographical concepts such as process, scale and interrelationships. When interpreting patterns, use numerical evidence to justify statements rather than relying on impressions. For example, if pebble size reduces downstream, quote average sizes, ranges and any correlation coefficient that supports the pattern, and relate this to fluvial processes of attrition and sorting. Conclusions should explicitly answer the enquiry question, reference the evidence used, and consider the broader context. Evaluation is an essential part of the enquiry and involves critical reflection on each stage. Discuss limitations such as small sample size, equipment imprecision, temporal constraints (one‑day snapshots versus longer trends), access problems or participant bias, and explain how these issues affect reliability and validity. Propose realistic improvements: for example, increasing sample size, using more precise instruments, repeating measurements at different times of year or employing stratified sampling to capture under‑represented areas. Finally, identify new questions that arise from your work and suggest how further study could extend understanding.

## Practical, ethical and safety considerations
Fieldwork must be safe, legal and ethical. Carrying out a risk assessment and following your centre’s safeguarding procedures are non‑negotiable. Consider physical risks such as steep slopes, water hazards and traffic; devise control measures like appropriate footwear, adult supervision and clear instructions; and ensure first‑aid provision and emergency contacts are available. Ethical considerations include obtaining informed consent when interviewing people, protecting participant anonymity where appropriate, and avoiding disturbance to wildlife and private property. Be a “sympathetic geographer” by respecting diversity and human rights: treat participants and local communities with courtesy, avoid intrusive questioning and reflect on the social context of your enquiry. In the context of the WJEC assessment, centres must provide a signed fieldwork statement confirming the date, location and nature of the fieldwork carried out.

## Exam technique
Approach Unit 2 with a clear structure in mind and show examiners the decisions you made and why. Start your write‑up with a concise introduction that sets out the enquiry question, hypothesis and the geographic rationale. Present a methods section that justifies site choice and sampling strategy, details equipment used and explains ethical and risk considerations. Use labelled maps with four‑ or six‑figure grid references to show sampled locations. Present processed data clearly with appropriate graphs, tables and maps, and include summary statistics. In the analysis, link numerical evidence to geographical explanations and show awareness of limitations: use phrases that demonstrate critical thinking, such as “the data suggest… because… however this pattern may be affected by…”. Your conclusions should directly answer the original question and refer back to the hypothesis. The evaluation must be specific: name what could be improved and how that would strengthen the enquiry. Manage your seven hours by allocating time to planning, data handling and writing up, making sure you leave time for checking references and ensuring all primary and secondary sources are cited. Submit any preparatory notes and the required fieldwork statement with your digital submission. Remember that assessors reward justified choices, clear use of evidence, and thoughtful evaluation as much as accurate measurements, so demonstrate reasoning as well as results.
