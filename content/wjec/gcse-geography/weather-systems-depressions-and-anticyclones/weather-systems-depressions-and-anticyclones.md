# Weather Systems, Depressions and Anticyclones (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: why weather systems matter
Weather systems shape everyday life across the UK and the world. They determine whether a day is sunny or stormy, whether rivers flood or crops suffer drought, and they influence longer-term climate patterns and human decisions about farming, planning and emergency response. For GCSE Geography you need to understand the difference between weather and climate, the main processes that produce rain and temperature change, how global atmospheric circulation creates belts of high and low pressure, and the detailed structure and impacts of two important mid-latitude features: depressions (low pressure systems) and anticyclones (high pressure systems). Being able to read synoptic charts and link physical processes to human consequences is central to good exam answers.

## Weather versus climate; the basics you must know
Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time — temperature, cloud, precipitation, wind and pressure on any given day. Climate is the long-term pattern of weather over many years in a region. When you describe climate for Wales or the UK you are talking about typical rainfall and temperature patterns through the seasons, shaped by latitude, ocean influence and prevailing winds. Weather changes hour to hour; climate is what you observe when weather statistics are averaged over decades. This distinction matters because weather hazards (flooding, storms, heatwaves) occur in the short term, while climate change alters the probabilities and severity of those hazards over time.

## Factors affecting temperature and rainfall in the UK
Temperature and rainfall vary because of a range of interacting factors. Latitude controls the angle of the sun and the amount of solar energy a place receives, so southern locations tend to be warmer than northern ones. Altitude makes a big difference: temperature falls with height, so upland areas are cooler. Aspect — the direction a slope faces — affects local insolation and therefore temperature and evaporation. Ocean currents and the surrounding sea moderate temperatures in coastal regions; the UK’s climate is milder than continental areas at similar latitudes because of the influence of the North Atlantic and the Gulf Stream/Atlantic currents. Prevailing winds, usually from the southwest for the UK, bring moist maritime air and influence both temperature and rainfall.

There are three main mechanisms that produce rainfall. Convectional rainfall occurs when strong heating of the surface causes air to rise, cool and condense, producing showers and thunderstorms in summer. Frontal (or cyclonic) rainfall happens where two air masses meet: warm air rises over colder denser air at a front, cools and condenses along a broad frontal band producing sustained rain. Relief (or orographic) rainfall is forced uplift of moist air over mountains, producing heavy rain on windward slopes and a rain shadow on the lee side. Understanding which mechanism is responsible in a given situation helps you explain the pattern and intensity of precipitation.

## Global atmospheric circulation and how pressure belts form
To understand why depressions cross the UK and anticyclones form, you must see the atmosphere as a system of energy transfer. The uneven heating of the Earth drives large-scale circulation of air in three broad cells in each hemisphere: the Hadley cell near the equator, the Ferrel cell in mid-latitudes and the Polar cell near the poles. Rising air at the equator produces a low pressure belt and heavy convectional rainfall. Air descending around 30° latitude forms subtropical highs — regions of higher pressure and drier conditions. In the mid-latitudes, the meeting of warm subtropical air and cold polar air creates a zone of instability known as the polar front. This is where mid-latitude depressions (also called cyclones) form and where the jet stream steers them from west to east. Seasonal differences and the tilt of the Earth change the position and strength of these circulation features, which explains seasonal weather differences in the UK.

## Depressions: structure, development and typical weather
Depressions are low pressure systems that develop along the polar front when disturbances in the upper atmosphere cause a wave to form on the front. Air converges towards the low at the surface and rises, cooling and condensing to produce cloud and precipitation. A classic mid-latitude depression has a warm front ahead of it and a cold front trailing behind it, with a warm sector of milder air between the two. The warm front produces prolonged, gentle rain and layered cloud as warm air slides up over cooler air. The cold front, which is steeper, forces rapid uplift and generates heavy showers, stronger winds and cumulonimbus clouds; where the cold front catches the warm front the system becomes occluded and weather patterns begin to change.

On a synoptic chart you will see closely packed isobars around an intense depression, indicating strong winds. Winds blow counter-clockwise and inwards around a low in the northern hemisphere, and pressure values are lower than the surrounding area. As depressions move from west to east across the UK, weather changes through the sequence of warm front, warm sector, cold front and post-frontal conditions; this sequence explains typical rapid changes in temperature, wind and rainfall. Depressions are responsible for many of the UK’s wet and windy days and can cause serious hazards. Recent examples include powerful Atlantic storms that brought intense rainfall and coastal damage, and named storms such as Storm Desmond, which caused severe flooding in parts of northern England in December 2015. When depressions stall or slow, their prolonged rain can lead to river and surface flooding and associated social, economic and environmental impacts.

## Anticyclones: formation, weather and seasonal contrasts
Anticyclones are areas of high pressure where air descends, warms and dries, suppressing cloud formation. On a synoptic chart an anticyclone is shown by widely spaced isobars and high pressure values relative to the surroundings. Winds blow clockwise and outwards around a high in the northern hemisphere. The subsiding air and light winds lead to clear skies and stable conditions, but anticyclones can produce very different effects depending on the season. Summer anticyclones commonly bring long periods of dry, settled weather and can be responsible for heatwaves and drought conditions when they persist. In winter, the same high pressure can produce cold, frosty, and foggy conditions; temperature inversions trapped under the high can lead to prolonged chilly and misty weather, and statutory impacts such as increased energy demand.

Anticyclonic conditions are not always benign: summer heatwaves associated with persistent highs raise health risks, increase demand for water and energy, and stress transport and agriculture. In recent years several summers have seen prolonged anticyclonic conditions and record high temperatures, highlighting the social and environmental importance of persistent high pressure systems.

## Reading synoptic charts and linking to impacts
To use weather systems effectively in answers, be confident with synoptic charts. Isobars show lines of equal pressure; the closer the isobars, the stronger the winds. Highs are labelled H and show outward clockwise winds; lows show inward counter-clockwise winds. Fronts are shown as lines with semicircles (warm fronts) or triangles (cold fronts) and their configuration around a low describes the system’s stage. When asked to describe the weather at a place from a chart, link the position relative to fronts and the centre of pressure to likely conditions: temperature changes as fronts pass, prolonged rain is associated with warm fronts, short intense showers with cold fronts, and clear dry conditions with anticyclones. Always tie the physical description to real impacts: rapid-onset flooding, transport disruption from high winds, agricultural damage from drought or heat stress, and human health risks.

When explaining causes, name the relevant processes: air masses, frontal uplift, convection and relief. When explaining impacts and responses, use specific examples such as flood management measures (flood warnings, river engineering), heat-health plans and forecasting improvements. For evaluation questions, assess the effectiveness and sustainability of responses and note how climate change can alter the frequency and intensity of the weather events under discussion.

## Weather extremes, hazards and climate change links
Both depressions and anticyclones can produce extreme weather and hazards. Intense depressions produce strong winds and heavy rainfall that lead to coastal and river flooding, infrastructure damage and economic costs. Prolonged anticyclones can create heatwaves, wildfires and water shortages, or, in winter, persistent cold and fog. Climate change interacts with these systems in several ways: a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture and can intensify rainfall during storms; changes in sea surface temperatures and in the jet stream can influence storm tracks and intensity; and persistent blocking highs (anticyclones that remain in place) may become more frequent or longer-lasting in some regions, increasing the risk of heatwaves and droughts. When answering exam questions that ask about climate change, use cautious and evidence-based language: describe the mechanisms by which warming can change weather systems and show awareness that regional effects and future projections contain uncertainties.

## Exam technique
When tackling exam questions on depressions and anticyclones, begin by defining key terms clearly and succinctly. For short-answer questions, describe one clear process (for example, how a cold front forces warm air to rise) and give a linked effect (heavy showers or strong winds). For medium-mark questions, organise your answer into a logical sequence: identify the system, describe its structure and typical weather, then explain the impacts and a management response. For extended answers, include a named example or case study to support your explanation and analyse the effectiveness of responses or the role of climate change. Use synoptic chart vocabulary accurately: isobars, fronts, warm sector, occlusion, clockwise/anticlockwise wind flow, rising/descending air. When interpreting a chart, always relate the position of a location to the nearby fronts and pressure centres and predict the sequence of weather changes.

Make sure you use clear cause-and-effect language: explain why something happens (mechanism), describe the weather that results, and then explain the human or environmental consequence. If asked to evaluate, balance strengths and limitations of management strategies and acknowledge uncertainties where appropriate. Time your answer so you leave a short planning period, and where possible include a brief concluding sentence that directly answers the question. Clear diagrams can support explanations but only use them if neat and labelled; otherwise spend your time writing precise prose. Practise past questions, learn one or two well-chosen case studies (one storm-related and one heatwave/anticyclonic event), and revise the vocabulary and synoptic-chart skills so you can apply them confidently under exam conditions.
