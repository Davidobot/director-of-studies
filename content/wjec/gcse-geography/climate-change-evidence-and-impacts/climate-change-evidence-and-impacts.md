# Climate Change: Evidence and Impacts (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## What we mean by climate change and the greenhouse effect
Climate change describes long-term shifts in average weather patterns and temperatures at regional and global scales. These shifts can occur over decades, centuries or much longer geological timescales. It is important to distinguish between weather, which is the state of the atmosphere day to day, and climate, which is the average of those weather patterns over a much longer period. The planet’s climate is shaped by the balance of energy received from the Sun and energy radiated back out to space. The natural greenhouse effect is a critical part of this balance: gases in the atmosphere such as water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide absorb and re-emit long wave radiation from the Earth, warming the surface and making the planet habitable. Human activities since the Industrial Revolution have increased concentrations of several of these greenhouse gases, causing an enhanced greenhouse effect and a rise in global average temperatures.

Explaining the greenhouse effect clearly is useful in exams. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms the surface; the surface emits heat as infrared radiation, which greenhouse gases trap to some degree, preventing all energy from escaping to space. The concept of radiative forcing helps describe how different factors—more CO2, aerosols from volcanic eruptions or changes in solar output—alter the energy balance and push the climate system towards warming or cooling.

## Natural drivers of past climate change and timescales
Earth’s climate has changed many times before humans could influence it, and this long-term variability is driven by several natural factors operating over different timescales. Orbital variations known as Milankovitch cycles alter the distribution and intensity of sunlight reaching the Earth and are linked to the timing of ice ages over tens to hundreds of thousands of years. Solar activity, including the number of sunspots, varies on shorter timescales and can slightly change the Sun’s output. Large volcanic eruptions inject aerosols into the upper atmosphere that reflect sunlight and can cause temporary global cooling lasting a few years. Over geological timescales, plate tectonics and changes in ocean circulation have also influenced climate.

When studying natural drivers, remember to compare their magnitude and timescale with recent changes. The current rapid warming, occurring over a century, is much faster and of different character than the slower natural cycles. This difference in rate is a central reason why human influence is the dominant cause of recent climate change.

## Human causes of recent warming
Since about 1750, concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere have risen sharply. The largest contributor is carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels—coal, oil and gas—and by deforestation and land-use change that reduce the planet’s capacity to absorb CO2. Methane emissions arise from agriculture (especially livestock and rice paddies), landfill and the extraction of fossil fuels. Nitrous oxide is released from agricultural fertilisers and some industrial processes. These increased greenhouse gas concentrations increase radiative forcing and raise global average temperatures.

Understanding the human causes includes recognising sectors and behaviours that emit greenhouse gases: energy production, transport, industry, agriculture and land use are key areas. Different greenhouse gases have different warming potentials and lifetimes in the atmosphere; carbon dioxide lasts longer and accumulates, which is why limiting CO2 emissions is critical for long-term climate stabilisation.

## Evidence that the climate is changing
Multiple independent lines of evidence show that the climate is warming and that atmospheric composition is changing. Direct instrumental records, such as global temperature series, show a clear upward trend in average surface temperature over the last century, with the most rapid warming in recent decades. The Keeling Curve, the continuous measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide at Mauna Loa since 1958, demonstrates both the seasonal cycle and a steady upward trend in CO2 concentrations. Proxy records from ice cores provide a much longer perspective, showing how CO2 and temperature have varied together over hundreds of thousands of years and revealing past glacials and interglacials. Tree rings, lake sediments and coral growth rings provide regional records of past climate and help place recent warming in context.

Physical evidence of a warming world includes retreating glaciers around the globe, shrinking ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, reductions in Arctic sea ice, and rising global sea levels driven by thermal expansion and melting land ice. Ocean warming and acidification are evident from sea temperature measurements and changes in ocean chemistry. Changes in the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events, such as more intense heatwaves and heavier short-duration rainfall, are consistent with a warming atmosphere that can hold more moisture. Together, these different sources of evidence form a coherent picture: the climate is changing and many observed changes are closely linked to increased greenhouse gas concentrations.

## Impacts on people and environments
The impacts of climate change are diverse and operate at local, regional and global scales. Warming temperatures alter ecosystems and species distributions, leading to habitat loss and increased risk of extinction for some plants and animals. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable: higher sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, while increased carbon dioxide dissolving into seawater reduces the ability of corals and shell-forming organisms to build skeletons. In polar regions, loss of sea ice and thawing permafrost transform landscapes and affect indigenous communities and wildlife.

For human societies, rising sea levels and more frequent coastal flooding threaten low-lying areas and island states, with potentially large effects on livelihoods, infrastructure and settlements. Low-lying deltas and coastal megacities are hotspots of vulnerability because they combine high population density with exposure to storm surge and sea-level rise. Changes in precipitation patterns can cause drought in some regions and more intense flooding in others, disrupting agriculture, water supply and food security. Heatwaves increase health risks, especially for older people and those without access to cooling. The distribution of disease vectors may shift with changing temperatures and humidity. Economically, climate change imposes costs in terms of damage to property, lost productivity, and the expense of adaptation measures.

Vulnerability varies greatly between places and social groups. Developing countries often face greater exposure and have less capacity to adapt, creating issues of equity and climate justice. Migration and displacement due to climate impacts are becoming part of the conversation about risk and humanitarian response.

## Oceans, carbon sinks and feedbacks
Oceans play a crucial role in the climate system by absorbing much of the extra heat and around a quarter of human CO2 emissions. This uptake moderates atmospheric warming but causes collateral problems: ocean heating contributes to thermal expansion and sea-level rise, while increased CO2 leads to ocean acidification. Carbon sinks such as forests and soils store carbon, and their health is central to limiting atmospheric CO2. Deforestation reduces this sink capacity and can convert forests into carbon sources.

Climate feedbacks are processes that amplify or dampen warming. A positive feedback example is the ice–albedo feedback: as ice and snow melt, darker surfaces are exposed, absorbing more sunlight and causing further warming. Permafrost thaw is another worrying feedback because it could release large amounts of methane and CO2, strengthening the greenhouse effect. Some feedbacks operate quickly, others over decades or centuries; understanding their potential and limits is an active area of research.

Managing these natural systems—protecting and restoring forests, managing soils and coastal ecosystems—forms part of climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, but actions must be carefully chosen for their environmental and social sustainability.

## Responses: mitigation, adaptation and international action
Addressing climate change requires both mitigation—actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance sinks—and adaptation—adjustments to reduce vulnerability to impacts already occurring. Mitigation involves transforming energy systems to renewables, increasing energy efficiency, decarbonising transport, changing land management and reducing emissions from agriculture. Nature-based solutions like reforestation and peatland restoration increase carbon storage while offering biodiversity benefits. Emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage are being explored but are not a substitute for rapid emissions cuts.

Adaptation includes building flood defences, redesigning drainage and urban spaces to cope with heavier rainfall, adopting drought-resistant crops, and planning for managed retreat where defence is unsustainable. Coastal management strategies vary from hard engineering like sea walls to soft engineering and managed realignment, which allow some coastal areas to flood under controlled conditions to protect more valuable locations. The sustainability of response options requires weighing economic costs, environmental impacts and social equity.

International frameworks coordinate global action. Agreements set collective goals for emissions reduction, finance and adaptation support, and recognise the need for developed countries to support vulnerable nations. At national and local levels, policy targets such as net-zero emissions and climate adaptation planning translate global commitments into practical measures. Education, public awareness and behavioural change are also important because many mitigation and adaptation choices occur at individual and community levels.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about climate change, start by making sure key terms are clearly defined: explain the difference between weather and climate, define greenhouse gases, and clarify what is meant by mitigation and adaptation. Use specific, named examples to show understanding and to score higher marks; for instance, refer to the Keeling Curve as evidence of rising CO2, the retreat of Alpine glaciers as physical evidence, or the Maldives and Bangladesh as examples of places at risk from sea-level rise. When asked to explain causes, structure your response so that natural drivers and human drivers are distinguished and linked to their relative importance in recent warming.

For assessment objective tasks that require analysis or evaluation, go beyond description. Explain links and processes, show cause and effect, and consider the scale of impacts and responses. When asked to evaluate or assess the effectiveness of management strategies, discuss economic, social and environmental dimensions and include a judgement on sustainability or feasibility. Use numerical evidence or trends where possible to strengthen answers, and when interpreting graphs or data describe what the data show and what that means for people or environments.

Practice planning longer answers with a clear introduction, focused paragraphs each containing a point supported by evidence, and a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. If a question asks for comparison, make sure to compare explicitly throughout rather than describe two cases separately and leave comparison to the end. Finally, where appropriate, comment on uncertainty and limitations of evidence, and consider who is most vulnerable—examiners mark awareness of complexity, so showing an understanding of differential impacts and the need for fair solutions will improve your response.
