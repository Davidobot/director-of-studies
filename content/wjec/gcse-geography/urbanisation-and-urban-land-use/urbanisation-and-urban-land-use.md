# Urbanisation and Urban Land Use (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## What is urbanisation and why does it matter?
Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of a country’s population comes to live in towns and cities. It is a long-term global trend that has accelerated at different times in different places. In the nineteenth century the industrial revolution drove rapid urbanisation in parts of Europe and North America as factories drew people from the countryside. More recently most of the fastest rates of urban growth have been in low- and middle-income countries, producing very large cities and megacities in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Urbanisation matters because it reshapes where and how people live, changing economic opportunities, social relations and the natural environment. Cities concentrate wealth, services and decision-making, but they can also concentrate disadvantage and environmental risk. Understanding urbanisation helps explain patterns of migration, pressure on housing and services, and the planning decisions that try to manage growth.

## Causes of urban growth: push and pull, natural increase and global forces
People move to cities for many reasons. ‘Push’ factors drive people away from rural areas, including declining farm incomes, lack of local jobs, poor services and environmental problems such as drought. ‘Pull’ factors attract people to urban areas: jobs in manufacturing or services, better schools and hospitals, and the social networks of relatives and friends already living in towns. Natural increase — where birth rates exceed death rates — also contributes to urban population growth, especially where migrants are young adults. Beyond individual motives, wider economic and political forces shape urban growth. Industrialisation, investment by multinational companies and globalisation concentrate jobs and wealth in particular cities that act as centres for finance, trade and transport. Government policies, such as land reform, infrastructure projects or resettlement schemes, can speed or slow urban growth. The result is uneven urbanisation: some cities expand rapidly into megacities, while others grow slowly or even shrink.

## Types of city and the global hierarchy: megacities, global cities and world cities
Cities can be classified in several useful ways. Megacities are urban areas with very large populations, commonly defined as exceeding ten million inhabitants; examples include Lagos, Mumbai and Shanghai. Global cities or world cities are those with outsized influence on the global economy and culture because of concentrations of business headquarters, financial markets, advanced services and connectivity. London, New York and Tokyo are frequently used examples. The role a city plays — regional centre, industrial town, port city or global hub — affects its land use, infrastructure and social patterns. Importantly, being a megacity does not automatically make a place a global city, and vice versa: some megacities have large informal economies and limited global influence, while some global cities are relatively compact but extremely economically powerful.

## Urban land use patterns and classic models
Urban land is used in different ways because of accessibility, land value and historical development. The Central Business District (CBD) is the core of many cities where land values and building heights are highest, and where offices, retail and cultural facilities cluster. Surrounding the CBD are inner-city areas that often contain older housing and light industry, suburbs of lower-density housing and, beyond them, the rural‑urban fringe where urban and rural uses mix. Urban geographers have developed models to help explain these patterns. The concentric zone model imagines rings of land use radiating from the centre, with wealthier suburbs further out. The sector model emphasises transport corridors so that high-income areas expand along certain routes. The multiple nuclei model suggests that cities develop several centres or nuclei, each with different functions such as universities, industrial parks or shopping centres. These models are simplifications but are valuable for explaining why land use changes with distance from the centre, how transport and accessibility influence development, and why different parts of the city have different social and economic characters.

## Informal settlements, inner‑city decline and suburban change
Rapid urban growth in many cities outpaces the supply of planned housing, creating informal settlements or slums where homes are self-built, services are limited and land tenure is insecure. These areas are often densely populated and vulnerable to hazards such as flooding or landslides. Inner-city zones in older industrial cities may show decline where factories closed, producing unemployment, derelict land and poor housing. At the same time, suburbs may grow through suburbanisation as people seek lower-density housing and green space; later trends can include counter-urbanisation, where people move beyond the suburbs into small towns or villages, and re-urbanisation, where central areas are regenerated and attract new residents. Gentrification is a specific pattern of change where investment and rising property prices transform lower-income neighbourhoods, displacing some residents while improving services and housing quality. The rural‑urban fringe frequently becomes a contested zone as greenfield sites are developed for housing, retail parks or industrial estates, while brownfield regeneration within the city favours reuse of previously built-on land.

## Impacts of urbanisation: social, economic and environmental
Urbanisation brings a mix of positive and negative consequences. Economically, cities create jobs, economies of scale, and innovation, and they can offer higher incomes and more varied services. Socially, cities can provide opportunities for education, healthcare and cultural life, but they can also produce inequalities, segregation and overcrowding. Informal economies provide livelihoods but can be precarious and poorly paid. Environmental impacts are often severe: expansion of impermeable surfaces increases flood risk, transport congestion and vehicle emissions degrade air quality, urban heat islands raise temperatures, and waste disposal can overwhelm local systems. Water supply and sewage infrastructure can be strained, especially where growth is rapid. These impacts are uneven; wealthy parts of a city may enjoy well-maintained parks and good services, while poorer districts suffer environmental injustices and limited resilience to hazards.

## Managing urban change: planning, policies and sustainable solutions
Cities are managed through a combination of planning, investment and community action. Traditional planning tools include zoning, development control and networks of parks and transport. Policy responses to the problems of urbanisation often aim to increase housing supply, improve infrastructure, reduce pollution and manage transport demand. Examples include creating affordable housing through public programmes, upgrading informal settlements in situ to provide secure tenure and improved services, redevelopment of brownfield sites to reduce greenfield loss, and investment in public transport to reduce congestion and carbon emissions. Innovative approaches to sustainability include green infrastructure such as sustainable urban drainage systems, urban greening and rooftop gardens to reduce flood risk and heat, and integrated transport systems that prioritise walking, cycling and public transit. Some cities use economic tools such as congestion charging to discourage car use and raise funds for improvements; others protect green belts to limit sprawl. Solutions are more likely to succeed when they combine technical measures with social policies that protect livelihoods and ensure inclusive decision-making, recognising that what is sustainable for one group may disadvantage another if not carefully planned.

## Case study examples to use in answers
When revising, it helps to have a few clear, contrasting case studies that illustrate the concepts above. London can be used to explain a global city with a diverse economy, a prominent CBD, expensive inner-city housing, strong public transport, and policies such as congestion charging and brownfield regeneration. Mumbai illustrates rapid urbanisation in a large economy where a significant informal housing sector exists alongside high-rise business districts; Dharavi is a well-known example of a dense informal settlement with a vibrant informal economy, acute service challenges and complex tenure issues. Lagos and Rio de Janeiro provide further contrasts: Lagos shows very rapid metropolitan growth with substantial informal settlements and infrastructural strain, while Rio’s combination of hillside favelas and affluent coastal neighbourhoods highlights spatial inequality and the challenges of security, planning and social inclusion. Use these examples to show cause-effect relationships, to compare responses and to evaluate their sustainability.

## Exam technique
To gain marks in WJEC/Eduqas questions on urbanisation and urban land use, start by defining key terms clearly and succinctly, such as urbanisation, CBD or informal settlement. Use place-specific examples to apply knowledge — examiners reward answers that show AO1 knowledge and AO2 application to contexts. When asked to explain causes or impacts, structure answers so that each paragraph deals with one clear reason or consequence and links cause and effect. For evaluation or longer questions, balance positive and negative points and reach a reasoned judgement that refers back to the question. Diagrams and labelled sketches of models such as the concentric zone or sector model are useful to illustrate patterns; if a question refers to maps or photographs, be precise in your descriptions of location, land use and likely processes. For fieldwork or skills-based parts, explain sampling choices, how data would be collected and why particular methods are appropriate, and discuss limitations and ways to improve reliability. Manage your time so that short-answer marks get concise factual responses and longer-response marks include development, evidence and a concluding sentence. Finally, use correct geographical vocabulary throughout, and where marking criteria expect analysis and evaluation, move beyond description to explain causes, consequences and the relative success of different management strategies.
