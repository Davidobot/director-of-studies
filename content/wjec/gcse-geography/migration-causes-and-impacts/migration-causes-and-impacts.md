# Migration: Causes and Impacts (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## What migration means and how it is classified
Migration describes the movement of people from one place to another with the intention of settling temporarily or permanently. It can happen within a country (internal or national migration) or across international borders. Modern usage prefers the terms regular and irregular instead of the older labels ‘legal’ and ‘illegal’. Regular migration refers to movement that follows the host country’s laws and immigration procedures, while irregular migration refers to movement that occurs outside or in breach of those rules. It is also important to distinguish between voluntary migration, where people move for opportunity or choice, and forced migration, where individuals are compelled to move because of conflict, persecution, natural disaster or serious human rights violations. Related terms that often appear in exam questions include asylum seeker, refugee and internally displaced person (IDP): an asylum seeker is someone who has applied for protection in another country, a refugee is someone whose claim has been recognised under international conventions, and an IDP is someone forced to move but who remains inside their own country.

## The main causes of migration: push and pull factors
People move for many interlinked reasons; these are often grouped into push factors that drive people away from a place and pull factors that attract them to a new location. Economic causes are among the most common: lack of employment, low wages or limited opportunities in a source area push people to look for work elsewhere, while the promise of higher pay, better jobs and improved living standards pull them towards host countries. For example, migration from Poland and other Central and Eastern European countries to the UK increased significantly when there were clearer job opportunities and higher wages in the UK compared with some source regions. Political causes include conflict, persecution and human rights abuses; wars and targeted violence force people to flee for their safety, as seen in large-scale movements from Syria during the 2010s. Environmental causes are increasingly significant: sudden disasters such as earthquakes, floods or hurricanes can displace people temporarily or permanently, and slow-onset changes such as sea-level rise, desertification and prolonged drought can make parts of the world less habitable, creating long-term displacement pressures for low-lying island states and some coastal or river-delta communities. Social and cultural factors also matter: family reunification, access to education or health services, and historical ties (for example through former colonial links or diasporas) can pull people towards particular host countries.

## Types of migration journeys and the risks involved
Migration can take many forms, from short-term and seasonal labour migration, where workers move for years or months and then return home, to permanent international relocation. Some migration flows operate through formal, legal routes such as work visas, student visas, family reunification processes and humanitarian resettlement schemes. Other movements are irregular and may involve dangerous journeys organised by smugglers. Crossing deserts, sea channels and remote borders often exposes migrants to exploitation, trafficking, injury and death. Asylum routes offer legal protection for people fleeing persecution, but the process of claiming asylum is complex: applicants must prove a well-founded fear of persecution and often face long waits. Understanding the variety of migration pathways helps explain different outcomes for migrants and why management strategies must be varied to reduce harm and protect rights.

## Impacts on migrants, source countries and host communities
Migration affects people and places in multiple ways and at different scales. For migrants themselves, movement can bring opportunities for safer lives, better incomes and education, but it can also involve separation from family, discrimination, precarious work, poor housing and limited access to services. Source countries feel the effects too. Remittances — money sent home by migrants — frequently provide a vital income stream that supports families, funds education and can stimulate local economies. At the same time, heavy outflows of skilled people can cause brain drain, leaving health systems, schools and industries short of trained staff. Demographic changes driven by migration can alter age structures and dependency ratios, sometimes relieving ageing populations in host countries or adding working-age people in source areas. Host communities experience economic advantages as migrants often fill labour shortages and contribute taxes and entrepreneurship, but rapid or poorly managed arrivals can strain public services, housing and infrastructure. Cultural impacts are complex: migration can foster multiculturalism, enrich societies with diverse languages, foods and arts, and improve international understanding, yet it can also create tensions over identity, community cohesion and competition for resources. Segregation may occur in housing or schooling if integration is limited, whereas successful inclusion policies can turn diversity into a long-term social and economic asset.

## Managing migration: policies, ethics and practical approaches
Governments and international bodies use a mix of policies to manage migration, balancing control with protection and economic needs. Policy tools include visa systems, points-based immigration schemes that select migrants for particular skills, family reunification rules, quotas, border controls and carrier sanctions. For people fleeing persecution, asylum laws and international refugee protection frameworks set out obligations on states to offer refuge. Management also involves preventing and reducing irregular migration through legal pathways, information campaigns and cooperation with origin and transit countries. Beyond control, there is a strong emphasis on integration strategies: language classes, access to education and healthcare, anti-discrimination measures and support for employment help migrants settle and contribute. Ethical considerations are central to any approach; human rights principles require that migrants are treated with dignity and that asylum seekers and refugees receive fair processes. Media representations and public discourse are powerful influences on migration policy and public opinion; sensational or biased reporting can increase fear and hostility, while balanced coverage can promote understanding. Sustainable responses also consider addressing root causes in source countries, such as development aid, investment in jobs and climate adaptation, which can reduce forced pressures to migrate while respecting people’s rights to move.

## Examples and relevance to Wales, the UK and named countries
Applying the ideas to real places helps make migration tangible. One clear example in recent years is the movement of workers from Poland to the UK after 2004, driven by pull factors such as demand for labour and higher incomes in the UK and push factors including limited job opportunities at home. This flow brought remittances home, supported key UK industries such as agriculture and construction, and contributed to cultural diversity in many towns and cities. A contrasting example is the forced displacement caused by the Syrian conflict, where millions of people sought refuge in neighbouring countries and in Europe; Germany accepted large numbers of asylum seekers, illustrating how host countries respond to humanitarian crises and the challenges of reception and integration. At a global level, small island states such as Kiribati and low-lying parts of Bangladesh face slow-onset sea-level rise and increased flooding, creating long-term questions about relocation, loss of land and the sustainability of livelihoods. Within Wales and the wider UK, migration has localised effects: international students bring economic benefit to universities and local businesses, while long-term in-migration can influence housing markets and services in particular communities. When preparing case studies for exams, students should pick one named source country and one named host country and explain the social, economic, environmental and political push and pull factors, and then describe impacts on migrants and both countries.

## Connecting migration to geographical concepts
To show deeper understanding, migration should be linked to key geographical concepts. Place and space are central: migration changes the character of places, creating new social landscapes and altering spatial patterns of population. Scale matters because causes and impacts operate from the local to the global: a drought might force villagers to migrate internally, while global labour markets draw people long distances. Processes and interrelationships are visible in how economic demand, political decisions and environmental change interact to produce migration flows. Continuity and change help explain how migration trends alter over time — for example, changes in policy or in global markets can quickly shift patterns of movement. Interpretation is required when evaluating sources and media accounts of migration, recognising bias, vested interests and the difference between statistical data and lived experience. Using these concepts in answers helps link factual detail to geographical thinking.

## Exam technique
When answering migration questions in the GCSE paper, begin by ensuring you use precise terms: regular/irregular migration, refugee, asylum seeker, remittances and brain drain. For short-answer questions aim to give one clear idea with an example; for extended questions plan your response with a brief introduction, two or three linked paragraphs and a short conclusion that evaluates or weighs up impacts. In case-study questions always name the source and host country you are discussing and apply specific evidence — for instance, mention remittance figures, changes in local services or examples of integration measures where possible. Where the question asks for causes, structure your answer around push and pull factors and relate them to social, economic, environmental and political categories. When asked about impacts or management, cover effects on migrants themselves, source countries and host communities, and judge how sustainable or ethical particular policies are. Use geographical concepts such as scale, inter-relationships and place to add depth and show understanding. If you are asked to evaluate or make a judgement, balance positive and negative effects and justify your position with evidence. Finally, be critical of sources: consider reliability, any bias and whether the data represent patterns over time or a one-off event. Writing clearly, using examples and linking answers to the course concepts will help you gain higher marks.
