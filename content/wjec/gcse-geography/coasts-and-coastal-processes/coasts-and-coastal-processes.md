# Coasts and Coastal Processes (GCSE Geography WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview
Coasts are dynamic zones where land, sea and human activity meet. Studying coasts for GCSE Geography means understanding the physical processes that shape shorelines, the landforms that result, and how people use and manage coastal areas. You will need to be able to explain processes such as weathering, erosion, transportation and deposition, describe how features like cliffs, arches, spits and dunes form, and evaluate human responses to coastal change. Welsh coastlines such as the Pembrokeshire coast and the Gower peninsula provide excellent local examples of both erosional and depositional environments and should be used to illustrate explanations wherever possible.

## Coastal processes: weathering, mass movement, erosion, transportation and deposition
Coastal change starts with a suite of physical processes acting together. Weathering weakens rock on the coast; salt crystallisation, freeze–thaw and biological weathering all make the cliff face more vulnerable. Mass movement occurs when rock and sediment move downslope under gravity, producing slumps or rockfalls that supply material to the beach. Erosion by the sea breaks material down and removes it: hydraulic action forces water into cracks, compressing air and eventually breaking rock apart; abrasion grinds cliffs with rock fragments; attrition tumbles pebbles against each other making them rounder and smaller; and solution dissolves soluble minerals. Once material is eroded it is transported along the coast and offshore. Wave action and currents move sediment by processes such as traction, saltation and suspension. They also move sediment laterally along the shore by longshore drift. Deposition occurs where wave energy falls—on sheltered bays, behind headlands or in estuaries—allowing beaches, spits and dunes to build up over time.

## Waves and beach profiles
Waves are the engine of coastal change, and their type and energy determine whether a coast is eroded or built up. Waves form because wind transfers energy to the sea, and the fetch—the distance over which the wind blows—helps determine wave size and energy. Constructive waves are low and long, with a gentle spill of swash that carries material up the beach, encouraging deposition and a flatter beach profile. Destructive waves are steeper and more powerful, with a strong backwash that removes material and steepens the beach. Seasonal shifts in wind and storm frequency lead to changes in beach profile during the year; many beaches build up in calmer months and are eroded in stormier periods. Understanding how wave energy varies in time and space is key to explaining both short-term change and longer-term coastal evolution.

## Erosional landforms
Erosional processes carve distinctive landforms where harder rock faces the full force of the sea. On headlands, waves exploit joints and weaknesses, eventually forming a sequence of cave, arch, stack and stump as rock is hollowed out and the roof collapses. Wave-cut platforms are formed where the base of a cliff is worn away, creating a bench at low tide and often leaving steep cliffs behind. Headlands and bays develop where alternating bands of resistant and less resistant rock run parallel to the coast; softer rocks are eroded into bays while harder rocks remain as protruding headlands that concentrate wave energy. Many parts of the Welsh coast, particularly in Pembrokeshire, show these classic erosional features and make useful case studies because cliff retreat, stacks and platforms are visible and measurable over human timescales.

## Depositional landforms
Where energy falls, material accumulates and a range of depositional landforms develops. Beaches are the most familiar, consisting of sand or shingle that shelters the coast and provides habitat and recreational space. Sand dunes form inland of beaches where wind transports sand, trapping it around vegetation and gradually building complex dune systems such as those on parts of the Gower peninsula and at Kenfig in South Wales. Longshore drift transports sediment along the shore and can create spits when the coast changes direction, extending narrow fingers of sand or shingle across bays or estuary entrances; in more sheltered locations this material may form bars or tombolos. The balance between supply of sediment, wave energy and coastal shape dictates whether depositional features grow, move, or disappear.

## Factors influencing rates of coastline change and coastal management
The rate at which a coastline changes is governed by physical factors—rock type and structure, the angle and shape of the coast, tidal range, sea-level change and the fetch and intensity of storms—and by human factors including land use, coastal development and engineered defences. Concordant and discordant coastlines respond differently because bands of rock are arranged either parallel or at right angles to the coast, producing different patterns of erosion and deposition. Human actions can both accelerate and mitigate change. Hard engineering, such as sea walls, groynes and revetments, offers immediate protection but can be expensive, visually intrusive and may transfer erosion elsewhere. Soft engineering, such as beach nourishment, managed realignment and dune restoration, works more with natural processes and is often more sustainable in the long term. Evaluating management strategies means weighing their effectiveness, cost, environmental impact and sustainability. For GCSE answers you should be able to discuss specific measures used at a named location, explain advantages and disadvantages, and judge whether the approach is sustainable in social, economic and environmental terms.

## Fieldwork and applying coastal knowledge
Fieldwork is central to learning about coasts because it lets you observe processes and collect primary data to support explanations and judgements. Practical enquiries might measure beach profiles along transects, sample sediment size and sorting using callipers and sieves, count pebble roundness, measure cliff angles with a clinometer, or estimate longshore drift by timing floats. Good fieldwork begins with clear enquiry questions, a justified sampling strategy and careful recording of methods so that results are reliable and reproducible. Processing field data requires statistical skills: calculating median and mean pebble size, finding ranges, plotting graphs to show trends, and using maps and GIS to locate study sites and present spatial patterns. Critical evaluation is equally important: reflect on limitations such as sample size, timing, accessibility and weather, consider how secondary sources (tide tables, historical maps, aerial photos) complement primary data, and suggest improvements or further investigations. Linking fieldwork findings to wider coastal processes and human impacts strengthens conclusions and fulfils the assessment objectives for enquiry work.

## Exam technique
When answering coastal questions in GCSE papers, always start by reading the question carefully and identifying the command word. If the task asks you to describe, give a clear sequence of features or events; if it asks you to explain, link processes and causes to effects; if it asks you to assess or evaluate, balance strengths and weaknesses and reach a justified judgement. Use place examples to make answers concrete: refer to a Welsh coastline such as Pembrokeshire for erosional landforms or to the Gower and Kenfig for depositional systems. For mid-mark questions, a diagram with clear labels can save time and add marks—sketch a simple cross-section of a beach profile, a sequence showing cave to stump, or a diagram of longshore drift. For extended responses, plan paragraphs so each makes one main point supported by evidence and explanation; a common structure is point, evidence, explanation and link back to the question. In decision-making or evaluate-style questions, address economic, social and environmental impacts and explicitly judge sustainability using the three pillars approach. For fieldwork NEA-style responses, be precise about methods and justify your sampling strategy; when drawing conclusions always link back to the original enquiry question and use data to support your claims, then evaluate limitations and suggest realistic improvements. Practice past questions under timed conditions, learn key terms and processes so definitions are accurate, and remember that examiners reward clear, well-supported arguments that show geographical understanding, application to context, and thoughtful evaluation.
