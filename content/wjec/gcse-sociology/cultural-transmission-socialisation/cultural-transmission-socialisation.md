# Cultural transmission and socialisation (GCSE Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## What is cultural transmission and why it matters
Cultural transmission is the process by which a society’s patterns of behaviour, beliefs and knowledge are passed from one generation to the next and shared between people within a society. In sociology this idea is central because it helps explain how individuals come to feel and act as members of a group rather than as isolated biological beings. Socialisation is the everyday process that achieves cultural transmission. It shapes our expectations, teaches us what counts as normal or acceptable, and gives us the categories—such as gender, class and ethnicity—through which we interpret ourselves and others. Understanding cultural transmission and socialisation helps us explain why people from the same society often behave in similar ways, how social order is created, why change occurs, and why different groups within the same society may develop different values and identities.

## Key concepts used when studying socialisation
Several concepts recur when we study cultural transmission. Culture refers to the shared ways of life of a group, including customs, beliefs, language and symbols. Norms are the unwritten rules about acceptable behaviour; values are deeper beliefs about what is important. Roles describe expected behaviour associated with a social position, while status indicates the social position itself, whether earned, ascribed, high or low. Identity is the self-concept formed through interaction with others and through the internalisation of social meanings. Sanctions are reactions to behaviour that encourage conformity or punish deviation; these can be positive, such as praise, or negative, such as fines or social exclusion. Cultural diversity recognises that different groups—regional, ethnic, religious or class-based—have different cultural practices and that these differences affect how individuals are socialised.

## Nature, nurture and the acquisition of identity
A key debate in socialisation is nature versus nurture: to what extent are our behaviours and identities the product of biology, and to what extent are they learned? Sociologists generally stress the importance of socialisation without denying biological factors. Cases of feral children, for example, illustrate the role of social interaction in developing language, emotional attachment and social skills, and they suggest there are critical periods in early life when social experience is especially important. At the same time, there is a social constructionist view that identities such as gender and class are created through interaction and social processes rather than being simply natural. Contemporary examples—such as changes in gender roles across generations—show how identity can change as societies change. It is also helpful to remember that identities are multiple and overlapping: someone’s sense of self can draw on gender, class, ethnicity, sexuality, religion and other factors at the same time.

## Major agents of socialisation and how they pass on culture
Socialisation takes place through a range of agents, each of which passes on culture in different ways. The family is the primary agent during early childhood. Parents and close kin transmit basic language, manners, routines and the first ideas about gender and hierarchy; sociologists describe this as primary socialisation because it establishes the foundation of identity. Schools and education are crucial secondary agents: through formal teaching they transmit knowledge and skills, and through the “hidden curriculum” they pass on expectations about punctuality, obedience, competition and merit. Peer groups are especially important in adolescence; friends provide approval or disapproval, shape tastes and leisure activities, and can reinforce or challenge family values. The media, now including social media, is a powerful transmitter of norms and images, offering role models, normalising certain behaviours and representing groups in particular ways that influence public attitudes. Other agents such as religion, work, and wider community networks also play their part. In practice, these agents interact: for instance, schools may reinforce or challenge family gender expectations, while media representations can influence both peer culture and adult behaviour.

## Mechanisms of socialisation and types of control
Cultural transmission works through a variety of mechanisms. Children learn by imitation, by being rewarded or punished, by being taught explicitly, and by observing the consequences of others’ actions. Sociologists identify forms of social control that encourage conformity. Informal social control includes praise, ridicule or ostracism from family and peers; formal social control involves laws, rules and sanctions enforced by institutions such as schools, the police and the courts. Sanctions may be immediate and personal, like a parent’s disapproval, or distant and impersonal, like imprisonment. Socialisation can be anticipatory, where individuals prepare for future roles (for example, vocational training), or resocialisation, where a person’s existing identity is deliberately changed (for example, in some workplaces or institutions). The process is not simply passive: people interpret, resist and negotiate social expectations, so socialisation involves both structure and agency.

## Cultural diversity, globalisation and change in socialisation
Patterns of cultural transmission are not fixed. Social change, migration and globalisation mean that people are exposed to a wider range of cultural influences than in the past. Multicultural societies present competing norms and values; families may pass on traditions from a country of origin while children at school or online adopt different practices. Technology, especially social media, accelerates exposure to global ideas and fashions, creating hybrid identities that blend local and global elements. Demographic shifts and changing laws—such as legal recognition of same-sex relationships—also reshape the norms that are transmitted. Sociologists examine both continuity and change, asking why some cultural traits persist while others spread rapidly. The concept of cultural diffusion helps explain how elements of culture move between groups, whereas concepts like assimilation and integration describe different responses to diversity.

## Theoretical perspectives on socialisation
Sociological theories offer different explanations of how and why culture is transmitted. Functionalist perspectives view socialisation as essential for social cohesion: by teaching shared norms and values, institutions like family and education bind people together and prepare them for specific roles. Talcott Parsons argued that primary socialisation equips children with the basic values needed for wider society. In contrast, Marxist theories argue that socialisation reproduces existing social inequalities by teaching acceptance of the status quo and by preparing different social classes for different positions in the economy; education, for example, may socialise working-class children into low-paid, routine jobs. Feminist theories highlight how socialisation reproduces gender inequalities, arguing that families, schools and media often transmit patriarchal norms that limit girls’ and women’s opportunities. Interactionist approaches focus on how identities are constructed in everyday interactions, emphasising labelling and the meanings people attach to behaviour; from this perspective, socialisation is an ongoing process shaped by interpretation rather than a one-way imposition of culture. Each perspective provides different insights and has different implications for how we might seek social change.

## Research methods and evaluating claims about socialisation
Studying cultural transmission uses a variety of research methods, and it is important to assess the strengths and limitations of the evidence we use. Ethnographic observation and longitudinal studies are valuable for understanding how socialisation unfolds over time and in context, while interviews and focus groups provide insight into people’s meanings and experiences. Quantitative methods such as surveys can identify broad patterns—how values or behaviours vary by age, class or ethnicity—but may miss the nuances of how socialisation happens. Secondary sources such as official statistics can show trends but must be interpreted cautiously, for example because not all behaviour is reported. Ethical questions arise when studying children or vulnerable groups, and access can be difficult. When you evaluate claims about socialisation in an exam, consider how the evidence was gathered, whether the sample was representative, whether researchers were objective, and whether alternative explanations are plausible.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on cultural transmission and socialisation, begin by defining the key terms you will use. For short answer questions, give a clear definition followed by a brief, relevant example such as family teaching gender roles or peers influencing leisure choices. For longer responses, structure your answer so that you include knowledge (AO1), application (AO2) and evaluation (AO3). A good strategy is to start with a short introduction that outlines your argument, then develop several paragraphs that apply sociological concepts to concrete examples, and end with a conclusion that evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence and theory. Always aim to link theory to evidence: for example, explain how Parsons’ idea of primary socialisation might account for conformity but also consider Marxist or feminist critiques that point to inequality or patriarchy. For evaluation, discuss the quality of the evidence, counter‑arguments and the role of agency. Where appropriate, bring in contemporary examples such as social media influence, multicultural families, or changes in law to show up-to-date understanding. Manage your time so that longer, higher-mark questions receive more detailed, balanced answers, and remember that clarity and use of sociological vocabulary will gain marks.
