# Poverty, social exclusion and life chances (GCSE Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## What we mean by poverty, social exclusion and life chances
Poverty is more than a low income: it is a condition that reduces people’s ability to participate fully in society. Sociologists distinguish between absolute poverty, where basic biological needs such as food, shelter and warmth are not met, and relative poverty, where people lack the resources that are typical in the society in which they live. Social exclusion describes the processes that push people to the margins of social, economic and civic life so that they cannot access jobs, services, or social networks. Life chances is a phrase first associated with Max Weber and it refers to the opportunities an individual has to improve their quality of life, such as access to good education, secure employment, health care and housing. Together these concepts help us understand how and why people experience very different outcomes across their lives.

## Measuring poverty: strengths and limits of different approaches
How poverty is measured matters because different measures give different pictures of who is affected. Absolute measures tend to use fixed thresholds based on a basket of essentials, while relative measures set the poverty line as a proportion of contemporary median income (for example, 60% of median household income). Material deprivation indices look beyond income to whether households can afford items and activities that are considered necessary, such as heating, adequate clothing or social participation. Subjective measures ask people whether they feel poor, which can reveal stigma and personal experience. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages: relative measures show changing standards of living but can indicate poverty even when everyone is materially comfortable; absolute measures capture basic need but can become outdated; material deprivation catches non-monetary poverty but relies on judgments about what counts as essential. In addition, official statistics can miss the “dark figure” of poverty caused by unreported income, informal work and temporary hardship.

## Who is most at risk and the patterns of poverty
Poverty is not evenly distributed. In the UK, some groups are consistently more likely to be poor: children (particularly those in single-parent households), lone parents, people with disabilities, some ethnic minority groups, young adults starting their working lives, and pensioners in particular contexts. The “working poor” are employed people who still struggle because of low wages, insecure contracts or high living costs. Geographical patterns also matter: deprivation is concentrated in some urban neighbourhoods and post-industrial towns but can be hidden in affluent suburbs. Gender plays a role because women are over-represented among low-paid, part-time and precarious work, and because caring responsibilities restrict labour market opportunities. Intersectionality is important: people who belong to more than one disadvantaged group—such as disabled ethnic minority women—often face compounded barriers and deeper poverty.

## Causes and processes: structural and individual explanations
Sociologists debate why poverty exists and persists. Structural explanations focus on economic and institutional factors: the decline of manufacturing and secure employment, the rise of precarious work and zero-hours contracts, austerity cuts to social security and public services, and the effects of globalisation which can shift jobs overseas. Discrimination within labour markets, education and housing—such as racism, sexism and ableism—also restrict opportunities for particular groups. Cultural or individual explanations, exemplified by the “culture of poverty” thesis advanced by some commentators, argue that attitudes, values or behaviours passed between generations sustain poverty. Most sociologists favour a combination: structural conditions set the context for life chances, while individual strategies and cultural resources shape how people navigate constraints. For example, two children from low-income families may have very different outcomes depending on access to social capital, school quality, and health.

## Social exclusion, the cycle of deprivation and effects on life chances
Social exclusion operates through many linked mechanisms and helps explain how disadvantage becomes long-term. The cycle of deprivation describes how poor housing, low-quality schooling, limited social networks, and health problems combine to restrict employment opportunities, which then reproduce poverty for the next generation. Excluded people may be cut off from digital access, transport, affordable childcare and cultural participation, making it harder to apply for jobs or complete training. These exclusions affect key life chances: educational attainment, occupational status and health. For instance, material hardship in early childhood is associated with worse educational outcomes, which then reduces the likelihood of stable, well-paid work and secure housing. Social policies that fail to break this cycle risk reproducing inequality over decades.

## Sociological explanations and key debates
Different sociological perspectives offer contrasting accounts of poverty and life chances. Functionalists see stratification as serving society, arguing that unequal rewards motivate people to fill different roles; critics of this view point out that it ignores structural barriers and inherited advantage. Marxists argue that capitalism produces poverty by allowing the bourgeoisie to exploit the proletariat and by creating insecure, low-paid work; they emphasise class conflict and the role of economic structures. Weberian analysis shifts attention to life chances in terms of class, status and party—highlighting how market position, social prestige and political power combine to shape opportunities. Feminist perspectives insist on the gendered nature of poverty, drawing attention to unpaid care, the feminisation of poverty and barriers such as the glass ceiling. Empirical debates include Townsend’s influential account of relative deprivation and social exclusion, which reframed poverty in terms of lacking resources necessary for normal participation, and Murray’s controversial “underclass” thesis which attributes persistent poverty to subcultural behaviours. Contemporary research, such as studies of social mobility and the role of private schooling or the “old boys’ network,” shows how privilege and institutional practices can preserve advantage across generations.

## Policies, responses and their debates
Governments and organisations respond to poverty through welfare provision, taxation, labour market regulation and public services. Policies such as progressive taxation, a generous social security system, minimum wage legislation and investment in early childhood education aim to reduce both absolute and relative poverty and to improve life chances. Active labour market programmes, apprenticeships and adult education seek to increase employability. Critics argue that some policies can create disincentives or fail to address structural inequalities; for example, benefit cuts and sanctions have been criticised for increasing hardship, while relying on market mechanisms in education and housing can widen inequalities. Internationally, globalisation has complicated policy responses: while trade and investment can create jobs, they can also depress wages in some sectors and increase job insecurity. Evaluating policy therefore requires attention to both intended effects and unintended consequences, and to the differing needs of various groups across gender, ethnicity, age and disability.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on poverty, social exclusion and life chances, begin by defining the key terms clearly and using them throughout your answer. For short answers, a concise definition followed by a relevant example will demonstrate AO1 and AO2. For longer responses, structure your answer so that each paragraph has a clear point, supported by evidence or a study, and followed by analysis and evaluation that addresses AO3.

To apply sociological theory, explain what a perspective says about poverty and then show how it helps to explain a specific pattern or example. For instance, when using a Marxist explanation, describe how capitalist labour markets might produce the working poor and then connect this to evidence about low-paid insecure employment. Balance explanations by evaluating their strengths and weaknesses: consider counter-arguments, such as how individual agency or cultural factors might interact with structural constraints, and discuss the extent to which evidence supports each view.

When a question asks you to “assess” or “evaluate,” explicitly weigh competing explanations and draw a reasoned conclusion. Use studies and thinkers named in the course—such as Townsend on relative deprivation, Murray on the underclass thesis, or Devine on the affluent worker—carefully, explaining their arguments and then critiquing them. Remember to consider methodological issues when relevant: discuss how measurements of poverty, sampling problems, or the “dark figure” might affect the evidence.

For data interpretation or applied methods questions, show that you can read trends and trends’ limitations. Refer to whether data come from official statistics, surveys or qualitative research, and discuss issues such as representativeness, validity and the impact of unreported phenomena. Where appropriate, suggest alternative research methods that could improve understanding.

Time management is crucial in examinations. Spend a few minutes planning longer answers: note the theories and examples you will use and the evaluation points you want to make. Use paragraphs to organise your argument and finish with a brief conclusion that answers the question directly. Aim to include both sociological knowledge and evaluative comment in every extended paragraph to meet AO1, AO2 and AO3. Finally, make your writing clear and precise: use sociological terms confidently, explain them, and link evidence to argument so that examiners can see your thinking at every stage.
