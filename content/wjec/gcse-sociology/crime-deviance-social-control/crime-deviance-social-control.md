# Crime, deviance and social control (GCSE Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## What we mean by crime and deviance
Sociologists make a clear distinction between crime and deviance. Crime refers to behaviour that breaks the formal laws of a society and can lead to official punishment such as fines, community sentences or imprisonment. Deviance is a broader term: it covers any action that breaks social norms and expectations, ranging from rude behaviour through to extreme forms of criminality. What counts as deviant or criminal varies between different societies and over time, so something illegal in one country or era may be acceptable somewhere else or at another time. This social construction of crime and deviance is an important starting point when thinking sociologically: it reminds us that rules are created and enforced by people and institutions, and that power and culture influence which behaviours are labelled unacceptable.

## The social construction of crime and deviance
Sociology emphasises that crime and deviance are not fixed categories but are shaped by cultural values, historical context and social reactions. Cultural variation can be illustrated by practices such as arranged marriages or alcohol consumption, which are judged differently across societies. Historical change is seen in how attitudes and laws have shifted on issues like homosexuality, which was criminal in the UK until the late twentieth century and is now legally recognised with equal rights. The process of labelling is central here: certain acts become defined as deviant because powerful groups label them so, and the media, politicians and moral entrepreneurs can amplify this labelling. The concept of moral panic describes moments when public anxiety about a perceived threat to social order is exaggerated, often by sensational reporting and political rhetoric. Studying these social processes helps us see that crime statistics are not just neutral facts but are produced within social and institutional frameworks.

## Social control: agencies, sanctions and social order
Social control refers to the ways in which behaviour is regulated to maintain order. It operates through both informal and formal mechanisms. Informal social control is exercised by the family, peer groups, teachers and local communities through approval, disapproval, gossip, praise and shame. Formal social control is carried out by state institutions such as the police, courts and prisons, using written laws, fines and custodial sentences. Agencies of social control overlap: schools teach rules and routines that reinforce social norms, parents socialise children into acceptable behaviour, religious institutions set moral expectations, and the media both reflects and shapes public attitudes. Sanctions can be positive or negative and range from a teacher’s praise for good behaviour to a prison sentence for a serious offence. Understanding how these mechanisms operate helps explain why most people conform and why some resist or break rules.

## Patterns of crime and explanations for differences
Sociologists investigate patterns in who commits crime and who is punished, paying attention to social class, gender, ethnicity and age. Recorded statistics consistently show higher rates of convictions and arrests among young people and males, but interpreting these patterns requires caution because different types of crime are recorded and policed differently. Class patterns are complicated: working-class neighbourhoods tend to have higher rates of recorded street crime, while middle-class and upper-class offenders are more likely to be involved in white-collar and corporate crimes that are less visible and often under‑reported. Ethnic minority groups can be over‑represented in criminal justice statistics, a pattern that prompts questions about policing practices, social disadvantage and institutional racism. Gender differences are explained partly by social roles and expectations—men tend to be involved in more violent and public forms of crime—yet feminist sociologists point out that social control of women and different opportunities shape these patterns. Age is a strong predictor of offending, with young people more likely to commit many types of offence; developmental, social and economic factors all play a part.

## The main sociological theories of crime and deviance
There is no single explanation for crime, and competing sociological perspectives offer different insights. Functionalism sees crime as an inevitable and sometimes useful part of social life: it can reinforce boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour and promote social change. Robert Merton’s strain theory, rooted in functionalist ideas, argues that when society’s goals are emphasised but the legitimate means to achieve them are blocked, people experience strain and may innovate or turn to crime.

Subcultural theories explain crime as the result of group values that differ from the mainstream. Albert Cohen, for example, argued that working-class youths who are denied status in school form delinquent subcultures that invert dominant values and gain status through anti‑school behaviour. Marxist and conflict perspectives shift focus to power and inequality, arguing that laws and their enforcement reflect ruling-class interests. Chambliss’s work on differential enforcement shows how elites can protect their interests while working-class and marginal groups are more heavily policed. Sutherland’s notion of white-collar crime highlights offences committed by people in positions of power, drawing attention to how some harmful acts remain less visible and less punished.

Interactionist approaches concentrate on labelling and social reaction. Howard Becker argued that deviance is produced when groups create rules and apply them to outsiders; being labelled can lead to a self‑fulfilling prophecy and a deviant career as the labelled person is pushed into deviant roles. Moral panics and media portrayals fit well with an interactionist focus on social reaction. Feminist theories emphasise gendered power relations: Heidensohn, for instance, examines how patriarchal controls in the family, workplace and public spaces restrict women’s opportunities and influence patterns of female conformity and deviance, while Carlen suggests that both class and gender shape criminal behaviour and the justice system’s responses to women.

## Types of crime, the “dark figure” and the role of the media
Crimes range widely from street-level offences such as vandalism and assault, to white-collar and corporate crimes like fraud, tax evasion and environmental damage. Corporate scandals and financial misconduct—examples often cited in contemporary debates—show how powerful organisations can commit large-scale harm that is sometimes slow to be uncovered and prosecuted. The “dark figure” of crime describes the gap between the amount of crime that actually occurs and the amount that appears in official statistics. Many offences go unreported by victims, are not recorded by police, or are dealt with informally, meaning official data underestimates true levels of harm. Victim surveys and self‑report studies are therefore important complements to police-recorded statistics because they can reveal hidden trends, though these methods have their own limitations. The media plays a powerful role in shaping public perceptions of crime: sensational reporting can exaggerate fears, contribute to moral panics, and influence policy responses such as calls for harsher sentencing or increased surveillance.

## Research methods and evidence in studying crime
A strong sociological understanding of crime draws on a range of research methods. Official statistics, such as police-recorded crime and court outcomes, are useful for measuring trends over time and comparing areas, but they are shaped by reporting practices and policing priorities. Victim surveys, like the Crime Survey for England and Wales, ask people directly about their experiences and help capture unreported offences, improving validity for certain crimes. Self-report studies, often used with young people, can reveal patterns of offending that evade official detection but may be affected by honesty and sampling issues. Qualitative methods—interviews, participant observation and case studies—provide depth and insight into motives, labelling processes and the social context of crime; however, they typically have limitations in terms of representativeness. Ethical issues are prominent in crime research: protecting respondents, ensuring informed consent, and avoiding harm are crucial when studying sensitive topics. Students should be able to consider the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and apply this understanding when evaluating evidence in exam answers.

## Policy responses, prevention and consequences
Sociological perspectives lead to different policy recommendations. A functionalist or consensus view might support policies that strengthen social institutions, improve education and promote social cohesion to reduce strain and delinquency. Stricter policing and harsher sentences are favoured by some approaches that emphasise deterrence, but evidence suggests that punitive policies alone do not address underlying causes. Marxist and critical perspectives favour tackling structural inequalities such as poverty, unemployment and lack of housing to reduce crime rooted in social disadvantage. Restorative justice, rehabilitation programmes and community-based interventions aim to repair harm and reintegrate offenders, addressing both victims’ needs and the social causes of offending. Understanding how different theories connect to policy helps explain why debates about crime control are often value‑laden and contested.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on crime, deviance and social control, start by making sure you understand the command word: define and explain for AO1, apply for AO2, and analyse or evaluate for AO3. For short-answer questions, give a clear definition and a concise example to demonstrate your knowledge. For longer, structured responses, ensure each paragraph has a clear point, supporting evidence and an application or evaluation. Use relevant sociological concepts and name key theorists when appropriate—for example, refer to Merton when discussing strain theory, Cohen for subcultures, Becker for labelling, Chambliss for differential enforcement, and Heidensohn or Carlen for feminist insights. Always show the link between theory and evidence: apply ideas to contemporary or familiar examples, such as youth crime, corporate scandals or high-profile moral panics, and comment on the strengths and limitations of the evidence you use. For evaluation, consider alternative explanations, issues of reliability and validity in the data, ethical problems with research methods, and wider social or historical context. In extended essays, a short introduction that defines key terms and outlines your argument will help examiners follow your response, and a concise conclusion that reaches a balanced judgement will secure higher AO3 marks. Manage your time so you leave a few minutes to check your spelling of key sociological terms and to ensure your argument reads clearly and directly.
