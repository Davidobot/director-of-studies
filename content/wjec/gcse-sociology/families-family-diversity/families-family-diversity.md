# Families and family diversity (GCSE Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: why families matter in sociology
The family is one of the central topics in GCSE Sociology because it is the main agent through which culture, identity and social roles are passed on. Sociologists study families to understand how individuals are socialised, how social rules are produced and reproduced, and how wider social changes — for example in the economy, law, religion and technology — shape everyday life. Studying families gives you tools to explain continuity and change, to compare different perspectives (consensus and conflict), and to evaluate the strength of different pieces of evidence. Throughout this topic you will need to think about different family forms, the debates over the functions of the family, changes in family relationships, and the inequalities that affect family life.

## What is a family and the main family forms
A family is not a single fixed thing but a social unit in which people are related by blood, marriage, partnership or shared responsibility for children. In the UK context you will be expected to recognise a range of family forms. The nuclear family is the traditional two-generation household made up of parents and their dependent children. An extended family includes relatives beyond the nuclear unit, such as grandparents, uncles and aunts, who may live together or nearby. Reconstituted (step) families form when partners with children from previous relationships marry or cohabit. Lone parent families are headed by one adult raising children. Cohabiting families live together without marriage. Beanpole families describe multi-generational but narrow family networks where there are more generations alive but fewer members in each generation. Single-sex families and same-sex parent families are increasingly visible as legal and social acceptance has grown. When studying these forms, remember to think about how family life is lived day-to-day — who does the childcare, who earns the money, and who makes decisions.

## Family diversity in the UK and global examples
Family diversity refers to the variety of family structures and practices found within and between societies. In the UK this diversity is shaped by ethnicity, class, religion, immigration and changing norms. Some ethnic minority families maintain extended kinship networks or communal childrearing practices that contrast with the nuclear ideal. Globally, family forms can be very different: polygamy is practiced in some cultures, arranged marriages remain common in others, and state policies have shaped family size in extreme cases, for example China’s historical one-child policy. Migration and globalisation have also created transnational families, where members are spread across countries but maintain strong emotional and economic ties. When you discuss diversity in exam answers, make sure to explain not only the different types of family but also the reasons for diversity, such as economic necessity, cultural tradition, legal frameworks and changing gender roles.

## Social changes affecting family structures
Over recent decades a number of broad social changes have altered family structures and the patterns of family life. Secularisation and changes in laws and values have reduced the social pressure to marry, contributing to later marriage ages, increased cohabitation and more serial partnerships. Economic factors, including women’s greater participation in paid work and shifts in employment patterns, have reduced the economic dependency that once sustained a single-earner nuclear family. Feminist movements have challenged traditional gender roles, leading to more negotiated domestic arrangements. Technology affects family life too, from contraception that allows family planning to social media that reshapes relationships and parenting. Immigration introduces different cultural norms and family arrangements. Sociologists such as the Rapoports highlighted family pluralism: the idea that modern societies support multiple family forms rather than a single dominant type. When explaining change, link cause and effect: show how laws, values, economy and culture interact to produce new patterns like rising lone-parent households, smaller family sizes, or mixed-ethnicity families.

## Changes in family relationships and roles
Changes in structure often go hand-in-hand with changing roles within the home. The domestic division of labour — who does housework and childcare — has been a central focus. Traditional segregated conjugal roles separate paid work for men and domestic work for women, while joint conjugal roles involve both partners sharing domestic tasks. Sociologists describe a shift toward more symmetrical families where couples share responsibilities more equally, particularly among younger and middle-class couples. The “New Man” idea captures the cultural image of men more involved in childcare and domestic tasks, although this change is uneven and influenced by class, culture and economic constraints. Other important patterns include the rise of dual-career families where both partners work paid jobs, the phenomenon of “boomerang” children returning home after higher education or unemployment, and the “sandwich” generation who care for both children and ageing parents. Decision-making and money management in families are also sites of power and negotiation; who controls household finances can reveal continued inequalities or more egalitarian partnerships.

## Sociological theories: how they explain the family
Different sociological perspectives offer contrasting explanations of the family’s role in society. Functionalist theory presents a consensus view: families perform positive, necessary functions for social stability. Talcott Parsons, for example, argued that the family performs primary socialisation of children and stabilisation of adult personalities, helping society to reproduce itself. The New Right also values the nuclear family, arguing that it is the best environment for raising children and that social problems stem from family breakdown. By contrast, Marxist perspectives see the family as serving capitalist interests. Marxists argue the family reproduces labour power, socialises acceptance of inequality, and acts as a unit of consumption that benefits capitalist economies; Zaretsky emphasises how family life cushions the impact of exploitation. Feminist theories analyse the family as a patriarchal institution where women’s labour (both paid and unpaid) is exploited and gender inequalities are produced and reproduced. Radical feminists such as Delphy and Leonard view the family as central to women’s oppression, while more liberal feminists focus on gradual reforms through changes in law and opportunity. When writing exam answers, you should be able to explain each perspective clearly and use them to interpret family patterns and changes.

## Criticisms, problems and the “dark side” of family life
While many sociological perspectives identify positive functions of family life, it is vital to recognise criticisms and the problems that occur within families. Critics suggest the decline of traditional functions can leave individuals isolated and lacking broader kinship support. Families can be sites of conflict, abuse and violence; domestic violence, child abuse and coercive control are serious social problems that challenge idealised views of the family. Divorce and marital breakdown create practical and emotional difficulties for adults and children, though they can also lead to reconstituted families and new family forms. Feminists have pointed out the status and role of women in families, arguing that unequal power and unrealistic expectations can produce stress and inequality. Some discussions of family decline point to “dysfunctional” families, but sociologists caution against moral panic; it is important to use evidence and to explain social causes such as poverty, unemployment and lack of social support. In essays, balance descriptions of problems with explanations of causes and consider policy responses where relevant.

## Research and evidence when studying families
Research methods are fundamental to understanding families. Sociologists use both quantitative sources, such as censuses and official statistics, and qualitative methods, such as interviews and ethnographies, to study family life. Quantitative data helps identify broad trends — for example, changes in household composition over time — but may miss the meanings people attach to family relationships. Qualitative research provides depth and insight into daily interactions, parenting styles and power dynamics, but may be limited in representativeness. When you use evidence in essays, evaluate its source: consider whether statistics might under-report phenomena (the “dark figure”), whether interviews are biased by social desirability, and whether access and ethical issues shaped the research. Be ready to discuss the strengths and limitations of different methods when explaining why sociologists reach different conclusions about family change and diversity.

## Exam technique
For exam answers, begin by reading the question carefully and underlining key command words such as “describe”, “explain”, “evaluate” or “compare”. Aim to show all three assessment objectives: demonstrate knowledge (AO1) by defining key concepts and naming relevant sociologists; apply knowledge (AO2) by linking theories to the specific context in the question (for example, using examples from the UK or a named family form); and analyse and evaluate (AO3) by offering balanced arguments, comparing perspectives and assessing the quality of evidence. In a 12-mark question allocate time to make two or three developed points with evidence and an evaluative comment. For 20–24 mark essays plan a clear structure: an introduction that outlines your argument, several paragraphs each with a point, explanation, sociological theory or study, and evaluation, and a brief conclusion that answers the question directly. Use named theories and studies to support points, but always explain their relevance rather than simply naming them. Where appropriate, compare competing views (for example, Functionalist vs Marxist vs Feminist) and weigh strengths and weaknesses, including methodological critiques. Practice writing concise introductions and conclusions, and practise timing so you can include evaluation in every answer. Finally, remember to place your answer in the UK context where the specification requires it, and to bring in contemporary examples when they help to illustrate your points.
