# Sociological theories and perspectives (GCSE Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## What sociology studies and the main perspectives
Sociology is the study of how societies are organised and how they shape the lives of individuals. At GCSE you will learn to think about the relationship between larger social structures — such as class, gender, institutions and culture — and individual choices and identities. A central distinction in sociology is between consensus perspectives, which see society as held together by shared norms and institutions, and conflict perspectives, which emphasise power, inequality and competing interests. Functionalism is the main consensus perspective: it argues that institutions such as the family and education perform useful functions that keep society stable. In contrast, Marxism, as a conflict perspective, focuses on how capitalism creates and reproduces class inequality; it highlights how institutions can serve the interests of the powerful. Feminism also belongs to the conflict tradition, drawing attention to gender inequality and the patriarchal features of many social institutions. Interactionist approaches focus on how people create social reality through everyday interactions, for example how labels or expectations can shape behaviour. Throughout the course you will use these perspectives to explain topics such as socialisation, the family, education, crime and social stratification.

## Key concepts, socialisation and cultural transmission
Understanding a set of core concepts will help you unpack sociological questions. Culture refers to the shared ways of life of a group, including values, norms, roles and status. Socialisation is the process through which people learn culture and acquire an identity; this happens through agents such as the family, education, peers and the media. Debates over nature and nurture ask to what extent behaviour is biologically determined or learned through social experience. Sociologists use dramatic examples such as feral children to show how the absence of socialisation affects development, and they also point to cultural differences in child-rearing and gender expectations to show the power of environment. Social control operates through sanctions and expectations; formal control comes from institutions like the police and schools, while informal control operates through family pressure, peer approval and media messages. Cultural transmission is the idea that values and norms are passed down across generations and through social institutions, and understanding how different agents do this helps explain why identities and behaviours vary by class, gender and ethnicity.

## The family: forms, changes and theories
The family is a vital focus for understanding identity and social relationships. Families take many forms in the UK and globally: nuclear and extended households, lone-parent families, reconstituted families after divorce, cohabiting couples, same-sex families and diverse family arrangements shaped by culture and law. Social change has altered family life over recent decades: laws, economic patterns, technology and shifting social norms have affected rates of marriage, divorce, cohabitation and fertility. Sociologists study these changes to explain trends such as later marriage, smaller family size, and more varied family structures.

Theories give different explanations of the family’s role. Functionalists argue the family performs essential functions for society, such as primary socialisation and emotional support; Parsons, for example, described the family as stabilising adult personalities. Marxists argue the family supports capitalism by reproducing labour power and ideological conformity, and writers like Zaretsky have suggested the family cushions the worker from exploitation. Feminists criticise the family as a site of patriarchy where gender power imbalances are reproduced, pointing to unequal domestic labour and domestic violence as evidence. The New Right offers a more conservative critique, arguing that a decline in traditional family forms harms social stability. When evaluating the family, you should consider both positive functions and negative consequences such as isolation, inequality between genders, and the "dark side" of family life where abuse and control occur.

## Education: functions, processes and achievement
Education is one of the main institutions that sociologists study to understand social reproduction, mobility and identity. Functionalists see education as serving society by transmitting shared values, preparing young people for work and encouraging meritocracy — the idea that achievements should depend on ability and effort. Durkheim emphasised education’s role in social solidarity, while Parsons saw schools as a bridge between family particularism and wider society’s universalistic standards. Marxists, however, argue that education reproduces class inequality and serves the needs of capitalism; Bowles and Gintis’s correspondence theory suggests that school organisation parallels workplace hierarchies, preparing pupils to accept future exploitation. Feminist scholars highlight how education can reinforce gender stereotypes or, alternatively, how changes in schooling have opened opportunities for girls.

Inside schools, processes such as labelling, streaming, the hidden curriculum and peer subcultures influence pupils’ outcomes. Teachers’ expectations can become self-fulfilling prophecies, helping some pupils to succeed and disadvantaging others. Sociologists study patterns of achievement by gender, class and ethnicity and look at material factors (such as poverty and resources), cultural factors (such as language and parental attitudes), and institutional factors (such as school choice and selection). Research into catchment areas, private schooling and the effects of streaming show how structural factors create unequal life chances. When explaining attainment you should draw on theories and specific mechanisms — for example, how working-class pupils may be labelled and thus pushed into lower sets, affecting their qualifications and future opportunities.

## Research methods and applied sociological enquiry
Sociology relies on a range of research methods so that claims about society are evidence-based. Research can produce primary data collected directly from participants and secondary data compiled by others. Methods fall broadly into quantitative approaches, such as structured questionnaires that produce numerical data, and qualitative approaches, such as unstructured interviews and participant observation that produce rich, detailed accounts. Each method has strengths and weaknesses. Quantitative data are useful for identifying patterns and comparing groups, but may miss context and depth. Qualitative data offer understanding of meanings and motivations, but are harder to generalise.

Key issues in research include validity (does the study measure what it claims?), reliability (could the results be reproduced?), ethics (informed consent, confidentiality, avoiding harm) and representativeness (does the sample reflect the wider population?). Practical problems such as gaining access to research subjects, dealing with gatekeepers, time and funding constraints, and the need for pilot studies must also be managed. Mixed methods combine quantitative and qualitative techniques and are often valuable because they balance breadth and depth. In applied methods you will also learn to interpret material presented in graphs, tables and charts, and to evaluate sources such as official statistics, victim surveys and self-report studies; for example, official crime statistics are useful for trends but can underestimate actual crime because of under-reporting, a phenomenon known as the "dark figure" of crime.

## Social differentiation, stratification and power
Sociology examines how people are organised into different positions in society and how those positions affect life chances. Stratification describes a system of structured inequality, and theories differ over its causes and consequences. Functionalist accounts, such as Davis and Moore, argue stratification has positive functions: it motivates people to fill different roles through rewards and ensures talent is allocated efficiently. Conflict perspectives, notably Marxism, see stratification as the outcome of exploitation, with the bourgeoisie controlling resources and ideology to maintain dominance. Weber offered a multi-dimensional view, arguing that class, status and party are separate sources of advantage and power. Feminists add that patriarchy structures gender inequality across institutions and workplaces.

Power can be formal, located in institutions and offices, or informal, expressed through cultural influence and social norms. Agencies of control — including the police, courts, media and education — help reproduce dominant power relations, sometimes through subtle mechanisms like stereotyping or gatekeeping. Sociologists investigate inequality across dimensions including class, gender, ethnicity, age, disability and sexuality, looking at patterns in income, health, education and criminal justice. Topics such as poverty, including absolute and relative deprivation, cycles of exclusion and the impact of globalisation, are explored to understand who is most vulnerable and why. Concepts such as the glass ceiling, institutional racism, ageism and models of disability (medical versus social) provide ways of explaining barriers to equality.

## Crime and deviance: explanations and evidence
Crime and deviance are studied to understand what society defines as unacceptable, who is likely to be criminalised, and why. Definitions of crime and deviance change over time and vary between cultures, showing that these are socially constructed categories. Social control operates through informal agents such as family and peers and formal systems such as the police and courts; sanctions range from social disapproval to imprisonment.

Theories of crime are diverse. Functionalists point to functions of crime and to strain theory, which claims that when socially approved goals are blocked, people may turn to deviance. Subcultural theories suggest that some groups develop alternative values that celebrate deviant behaviour. Marxists focus on the selective enforcement of laws and on crimes of the powerful, including white-collar and corporate crime. Interactionists highlight labelling processes: being labelled as a criminal can lead to a deviant career as the labelled individual is pushed to conform to that identity. Feminist approaches examine how gender shapes patterns of offending and victimisation and explore explanations for female conformity and marginalisation in the criminal justice system.

When using data on crime you should be aware of limitations. Official statistics reveal trends but are shaped by police recording practices and public reporting. Victim and self-report surveys can uncover unrecorded offending, but each source has biases. Sociological answers should combine theory with evidence, explaining patterns by social class, gender, age and ethnicity, and analysing how social structures and cultural meanings interact to produce crime and responses to it.

## Exam technique
To succeed in WJEC Eduqas GCSE Sociology, make sure you meet the assessment objectives: demonstrate knowledge (AO1), apply that knowledge to context (AO2), and analyse and evaluate (AO3). For short-answer questions, use clear sociological terms and concise definitions. For longer structured questions, apply a theory or study to the scenario given and explain how it helps to understand the issue; always bring in an example or piece of evidence to support your point. For extended-response questions allocate time to plan a coherent argument, present several analytical points, and conclude with an evaluative judgement. Use the “point, explain, example, evaluate” approach so each paragraph makes a clear claim, explains its sociological basis, gives evidence or an example, and then considers limitations or alternative perspectives. Remember to include research methods where relevant — for example, when evaluating evidence, comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the data source and whether it is valid or representative. Time management is important: read the question carefully, underline command words (describe, explain, assess), and avoid waffle. Practise past-style questions under timed conditions, and learn how to weave theory, concepts and methods together in your answers so that each response demonstrates knowledge, application and critical evaluation.
