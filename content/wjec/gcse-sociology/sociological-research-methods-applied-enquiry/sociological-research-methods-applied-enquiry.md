# Sociological research methods and applied enquiry (GCSE Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## What is sociological research and why it matters
Sociological research is the systematic way sociologists collect, analyse and interpret evidence about how people live together. At GCSE level, research methods are not just a separate topic to be learned: they are the tools you use to test ideas about families, education, crime and inequality. Research helps us move from common-sense impressions to evidence-based explanations. For example, instead of assuming that exam results reflect only talent, sociological research lets us explore how class, school processes or culture shape achievement. Understanding methods also helps you judge the strength of sociological claims: when you read about patterns in official statistics or case studies from qualitative research, you should ask how the evidence was gathered and whether it can support the conclusions drawn.

## Types of data and sources
Sociologists work with two broad distinctions of data. Primary data is information gathered directly by the researcher for a specific project, such as questionnaires completed in class or interviews with parents about family life. Secondary data is material produced for other purposes that researchers reuse, including official statistics, academic journal articles, newspapers, journals and historical documents. Another important distinction is between quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data is numerical and can show patterns and trends, such as GCSE attainment rates by social class or the number of recorded crimes in a year. Qualitative data is descriptive and seeks depth and meaning; it comes from interviews, participant observation or open-ended survey responses and helps us understand motives, experiences and the social meanings people attach to their actions. Each type of data and source has its uses: official statistics are invaluable for showing large-scale trends in unemployment or crime, while a small set of interviews can reveal why young people form anti-school subcultures or how parents negotiate household roles.

## Methods of research and their strengths and weaknesses
There are several common research methods you must know and evaluate. Questionnaires, which can be structured with fixed-response items, are efficient for gathering quantitative data from many people and are useful when you need representative samples. Their weakness lies in limited depth and the risk of low response rates or dishonest answers. Structured interviews follow a pre-set schedule and improve comparability between respondents, while unstructured interviews are more like guided conversations and produce rich qualitative data but are harder to compare and take longer to analyse. Observational methods can be either participant (the researcher takes part in the setting) or non‑participant (observing from the outside), and either overt (people know they are being observed) or covert (they do not). Participant observation gives deep insight into everyday interactions and subcultures, but raises ethical issues and can be time-consuming and hard to replicate. Covert observation may produce more natural behaviour but poses serious ethical problems. Other approaches include case studies, life histories and the use of diaries. Each method should be assessed in terms of validity (does it capture what it claims to measure?), reliability (could another researcher repeat the study and get similar results?), representativeness (can findings be generalised?), ethics and practicality (time and cost). Mixed methods combine quantitative and qualitative techniques and often offer a balance: surveys can identify patterns that interviews then explain in detail.

## Sampling and representativeness
Sampling determines how far we can generalise research findings beyond the people actually studied. Representative sampling aims to select participants so that they reflect the wider population; techniques include simple random sampling, systematic sampling and stratified sampling which ensures sub-groups (for example, social class or ethnicity) are included in proportion. Non-representative methods such as opportunity (convenience), snowball or quota sampling are quicker and cheaper but risk bias. For example, a snowball sample used to access a hidden group like young people involved in informal street economies can be the only practical route to data, but results cannot be assumed to reflect the whole population. Sample size also matters: small samples may be rich in qualitative insight but limited in generalisability, while large samples improve statistical confidence but may lack depth. When evaluating studies, always consider how the sampling technique affects the claims the researcher can legitimately make.

## Practical issues and ethical considerations
Practical constraints frequently shape sociological research. Gaining access to schools, prisons or workplaces often requires permission from gatekeepers such as headteachers or managers, and gatekeepers’ cooperation can affect who is studied and what data is collected. Time and cost limit how long observations can last and how many interviews can be conducted. Ethics is central to sociological enquiry: researchers must consider informed consent, confidentiality, the risk of harm, and the use of deception. Informed consent means participants know the purpose of the research and agree to take part; confidentiality means personal details are not revealed; harm includes psychological distress or damaging reputations; deception involves giving false information to participants and is only justifiable in exceptional circumstances and with appropriate safeguards. Strategies to address ethical issues include anonymisation of data, obtaining parental consent for minors, debriefing participants after covert elements, and using pilot studies to anticipate problems. Ethical constraints may limit the methods you can use—overt participant observation in a vulnerable setting may be acceptable whereas covert methods may not be—but these constraints are part of what makes sociological research responsible and trustworthy.

## The research process and applied enquiry
Applied methods of sociological enquiry involve planning a study from the initial idea through to analysis. The process typically begins with choosing a research area and establishing a clear aim or hypothesis. A pilot study is then often used to test questions or procedures and refine the approach. The researcher chooses an appropriate method (or a combination of methods), selects a sampling technique, gathers data and analyses it. Analysis may involve statistical techniques for quantitative data or coding and thematic analysis for qualitative material. In applied enquiry, the emphasis is on using research to address real questions and on evaluating how well different methods answer those questions. For example, if you want to investigate whether streaming increases inequality in achievement, you might use official attainment data to map patterns (quantitative), classroom observations to see how streaming operates in practice (qualitative), and interviews with teachers to understand expectations and labels. This mixed-methods approach allows you to triangulate findings: where different methods point to the same conclusion, the evidence is stronger. Throughout the research process, reflexivity—awareness of how the researcher’s own background and actions may influence the study—helps to explain potential biases and limitations.

## Interpreting and presenting data
Being able to interpret graphs, tables, charts and statistics is essential. When you examine a table of exam results, look for overall trends (rising or falling), differences between groups (gender, class, ethnicity) and any anomalies. Consider how far a correlation implies causation and whether other variables might explain a pattern. In crime studies, official statistics can show long-term trends but must be read alongside victim surveys and self-report studies to account for the “dark figure” of unreported crime. Self-report studies may reveal experiences that never enter official records, but they also depend on respondents’ willingness to disclose. Qualitative data can be presented as illustrative quotations or case descriptions to add depth and human meaning to numerical patterns. When writing up findings, clarity matters: label axes and tables, explain where the data came from, and be honest about limitations such as sample size, possible biases, and measurement problems. In applied enquiry, the aim is not only to describe patterns but to evaluate how well the methods used support any conclusions and to suggest improvements or further research.

## Exam technique
To do well in exam questions on research methods and applied enquiry, be explicit about which assessment objective you are addressing. For AO1 (knowledge), define key terms such as validity, reliability, primary/secondary data, and types of sampling. For AO2 (application), link methods to specific topics or studies—for example, say how a questionnaire could measure pupil attitudes to homework or how participant observation could reveal peer-group pressures. For AO3 (evaluation), balance positives and negatives: discuss strengths and weaknesses in terms of validity, reliability, ethics, representativeness and practicality. Use examples or brief mini-case studies to support points and show sociological thinking. Structure longer answers with clear paragraphs that make a point, explain it, give an example and then evaluate it. Pay attention to the command words in the question: “describe” asks for clear explanation, “explain” requires cause and effect, “evaluate” needs balanced assessment, and “assess” asks you to weigh up evidence before reaching a judgement. Manage your time by allocating marks proportionally—spend longer on questions worth more marks and reserve a few minutes to write a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Finally, practise interpreting data under timed conditions and always link method strengths and limitations back to how they affect the sociological claims being made; examiners reward answers that combine clear knowledge with relevant application and thoughtful evaluation.
