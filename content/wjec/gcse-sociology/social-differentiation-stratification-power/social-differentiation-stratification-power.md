# Social differentiation, stratification and power (GCSE Sociology WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: what we mean by social differentiation, stratification and power
Social differentiation describes the process by which society is divided into distinct groups, such as by age, gender, class, ethnicity, disability or sexuality. Stratification is the structured ranking of these groups so that some have greater access to resources, status and life chances than others. Power is the capacity of individuals or groups to make decisions that affect others, to influence behaviour and to control resources; authority is the legitimate form of power. Together, these ideas explain why people in the same society experience very different outcomes in areas such as education, work, health, income and justice. Understanding these ideas helps us analyse social order and conflict, and to evaluate claims about equality and fairness in a modern UK context.

## Major sociological theories of stratification
Different sociological perspectives offer competing explanations for why societies are stratified. Functionalists argue that stratification is a necessary and useful feature of society: positions must be filled, and different roles require different talents and rewards. Davis and Moore suggested that unequal rewards motivate people to train for and perform the most important jobs, producing efficient role-allocation. This leads to the idea of meritocracy, where position is earned through ability and effort. By contrast, Marxists see stratification as rooted in the economic organisation of capitalism. They argue that society is divided into classes defined by their relationship to the means of production: the bourgeoisie who own capital and the proletariat who sell their labour. For Marxists, inequality is a result of exploitation and is reproduced through ideology and institutions. Weber expanded the debate by adding status and party to class: for Weber, stratification involves economic class, social prestige (status) and political power (party), which may overlap but can also differ. Feminist perspectives foreground patriarchy, arguing that gender is a key axis of stratification: institutions and cultural norms can systematically disadvantage women, producing gendered divisions of power and opportunity. When you answer exam questions, name these perspectives and use them to explain different patterns of inequality.

## Forms and sources of power and authority
Power can be formal, exercised through institutions such as the state, courts and police, or informal, exercised through cultural influence, family and media. Max Weber’s typology of authority remains a helpful tool for understanding legitimacy. Traditional authority rests on customs and inherited power, charismatic authority rests on an individual’s personality and ability to inspire followers, and rational-legal authority rests on rules, laws and formal offices. In practice, power is held and exercised through a range of agencies: governments use legislation and welfare policy; employers exercise economic power in the workplace; educational institutions shape opportunities; and media and cultural elites influence norms and public perceptions. Power is often invisible: networks such as the “old boys’ network” or informal connections can secure jobs and influence without formal recognition. Noting the source of power helps explain how inequalities are sustained or challenged.

## Inequality across life chances: class, gender, ethnicity, age, disability and sexuality
Inequality appears across many areas of life. Social class continues to shape educational attainment, occupational opportunities and income. Children from wealthier families can access private schools, extra tuition and stable housing, advantages that accumulate into higher adult incomes and better health. Gender inequalities show up in pay gaps, occupational segregation and the “glass ceiling” that blocks many women from senior positions, while some men face a “crisis of masculinity” in changing labour markets. Ethnic inequalities are visible in unemployment rates, housing, health outcomes and criminal justice statistics; institutional racism can produce systematic disadvantages even when overt prejudice is absent. Ageism affects older people’s access to work and services, and young people may be stereotyped in media and policy. Disability is experienced both as impairment and as social exclusion; the medical model focuses on individual impairment, while the social model locates disadvantage in barriers and discrimination within society. Sexuality shapes experiences through homophobia and heteronormative assumptions that can limit rights and recognition. In each case, patterns of inequality are complex and intersectional: someone’s life chances are shaped by the combined effects of class, gender, ethnicity and other identities.

## Factors influencing access to life chances and power
A range of social processes and institutions influence who gains access to resources and decision-making. Cultural processes such as socialisation create expectations about roles and abilities, often reproducing stereotypes that limit opportunities. Prejudice, discrimination and stereotyping by employers, schools or officials can restrict access to jobs and services. Media representation affects public perception, shaping who is seen as deserving or dangerous, which in turn can influence policy. Legislation can reduce inequality: anti-discrimination laws, minimum wage policies and educational reforms can open up opportunities, while cuts to welfare or regressive tax policies can widen gaps. Subcultures and moral panics shape social reactions to particular groups (for example, youth subcultures being labelled as deviant), while gatekeeping practices in professions and elite networks preserve privilege. When analysing answers, connect these factors to specific examples such as private schooling and elite recruitment, the glass ceiling in corporate contexts, or institutional racism within criminal justice systems.

## Poverty, social exclusion and global influences
Poverty can be understood in absolute and relative terms. Absolute poverty refers to a lack of the basic resources necessary to survive, while relative poverty measures people’s resources against wider societal standards. Material deprivation highlights shortages of income, housing and access to services. Sociologists have described how poverty can be cyclical: disadvantage in early life can lead to poorer education, lower-paid work and worse health, passing disadvantage between generations. The concept of social exclusion emphasises how people can be shut out of normal social, economic and cultural life. Debates around a “culture of poverty” suggest that attitudes and behaviours can perpetuate disadvantage, although critics argue that structural causes—such as deindustrialisation, welfare policy and global economic shifts—are more important. Globalisation also matters: the movement of capital, changes to labour markets and international policy can affect employment and inequality in the UK. Recognising the roots of poverty is essential for evaluating policy responses and for constructing balanced exam answers.

## Crime, social control and the relationship to power
Crime and deviance are socially constructed: what counts as criminal or deviant varies across time and place. Social control is exercised both informally—through family, peers, religion and media—and formally, through the police, courts and prisons. Patterns of offending and victimisation often reflect wider inequalities: class, age, gender and ethnicity all show different crime profiles. Theories explain crime in different ways. Functionalists view crime as having social functions and attribute some crime to anomie and strain when goals and means are mismatched. Subcultural theories explain youth crime as a response to blocked opportunities. Marxist analyses focus on the differential enforcement of the law and highlight white-collar and corporate crime as expressions of elite power. Interactionists stress labelling and the process by which individuals become “deviant” through social reaction, and feminist perspectives draw attention to how gender shapes both offending and the control of women. When using data on crime, remember the “dark figure”: many crimes go unreported or unrecorded, so official statistics can misrepresent reality. Victim surveys and self-report studies offer alternatives but have their own limitations. A sociological answer should link crime to power, showing how laws reflect social interests and how enforcement can reproduce inequalities.

## Research and evidence: how sociologists study stratification and power
Studying social differentiation requires careful use of methods and evidence. Quantitative sources such as official statistics, income surveys and large-scale datasets are valuable for identifying broad patterns in employment, health or education. Qualitative methods—interviews, ethnography and participant observation—are valuable for understanding lived experience, meanings and processes such as labelling or exclusion. Each method has strengths and weaknesses: official statistics are useful for trends but may conceal the invisible or unreported; interviews give depth but may lack representativeness; experiments and structured questionnaires can be reliable but miss context. Ethical issues are central when researching vulnerable groups: informed consent, confidentiality and avoiding harm are essential. Sampling decisions—representative versus purposive samples—shape the conclusions that can be drawn. Mixed-methods approaches often provide the most rounded picture, combining the generalisability of quantitative data with the depth of qualitative insight. In exams, show awareness of research limitations when you use evidence to support explanations of inequality and power.

## Exam technique
To score highly on WJEC/Eduqas questions about social differentiation, stratification and power, combine clear definitions with applied examples, theory and evaluation. Start answers by defining key terms (for example, stratification, power or relative poverty) and by identifying the perspective you will use. Apply sociological theory to UK examples: explain how a functionalist, Marxist, Weberian or feminist account would interpret the same issue and illustrate each claim with contemporary or classical examples, such as private schooling, the glass ceiling, institutional racism or the “dark figure” of crime. For longer questions include an explicit “evaluation” paragraph that weighs strengths and weaknesses of explanations, points out empirical limitations, and suggests alternative interpretations. When using evidence, comment on its source and reliability: note whether statistics might under-report a problem or whether qualitative studies may lack representativeness. Keep subject-specific terminology accurate and use it throughout your answer to show AO1 knowledge. For AO2, apply theory and evidence to the question; for AO3, provide analysis and evaluation that reaches a clear conclusion. In timed exams, plan short paragraphs that each make a single point with explanation and example, and reserve time to write a concluding sentence that answers the question directly. Finally, remember that research methods are often examined alongside theorising about inequality: show awareness of how the evidence you use was produced, and link method critique to the argument you are making.
