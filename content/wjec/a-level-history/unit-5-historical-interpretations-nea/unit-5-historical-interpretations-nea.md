# Unit 5 NEA — Historical Interpretations (independent investigation) (A-level History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of Unit 5
Unit 5 is the non-examination assessment (NEA) component of the WJEC/AQA A‑level History course that asks you to carry out an extended independent investigation into an issue of historical debate. It is worth 60 marks and contributes 20% of the overall A‑level. The task is an extended essay of between 3,000 and 4,000 words (excluding extracts from sources and interpretations) in which you explain how and why different historical interpretations have been formed about a clearly defined question. The enquiry must address a contentious issue, must develop and evaluate a range of contemporary and later evidence, and must place at least two differing interpretations in their historiographical context. The NEA is your opportunity to bring together the skills you have practised across the course: selecting and deploying knowledge, analysing sources, engaging with historians’ debates and producing a careful, evidence‑based judgement.

## What WJEC expects and the assessment focus
WJEC allocates the unit’s marks across the three assessment objectives in the following way: AO1 (use of knowledge, organisation and judgement) 25% of the component, AO2 (analysis and evaluation of source material) 25% of the component, and AO3 (analysis and evaluation of historical interpretations and historiography) 50% of the component. The marking scheme rewards coherent, well‑substantiated argument, judicious use of evidence, clear understanding of provenance and context when handling sources, and a well‑developed awareness of why historians differ in their interpretations. High‑scoring work shows sustained evaluation: it does not merely describe interpretations or summarise sources but interrogates their basis and limitations and integrates that interrogation into an overall, balanced conclusion.

## Choosing a question and getting approval
Your enquiry must take the form of an issue and a focused question that can be researched and argued within the word limit. The question must be approved by WJEC via a Proposal Form and learners must not start their investigations until written approval has been received; centres must submit proposals at least ten weeks before the start of the exercise. The NEA question should be capable of debate and should not duplicate the specific content studied in your Units 2 and 4 depth studies. Centres may offer up to four approved titles for a cohort, or learners may propose their own titles. Approved titles may be used for up to three years. Good titles are precise, historically bounded and invitational of analysis of interpretations rather than mere narrative: examples might include assessments drawn from the specification such as an evaluation of Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement to 1939, a question about the economic versus social impact of the Black Death in 1348–1400, or an enquiry into the role of education in the survival of the Welsh language during the twentieth century. Choose a question that stretches your knowledge but is narrow enough to research thoroughly.

## Researching sources and the historiography
Your NEA must be built on a carefully selected range of evidence. WJEC expects a “range” of around eight to ten items in total, combining contemporary primary material and later interpretations. Sources can include official documents, letters, newspaper reports, eyewitness accounts, images, speeches, parliamentary debates, statistical data and relevant sections of modern historical works. You should take care to find material that illuminates different sides of the debate rather than simply backing a predetermined view. Equally important is the historiographical component: you must identify at least two differing or contrasting historical interpretations and explain why historians have reached different conclusions. This means tracing how interpretations have developed over time, what evidence or theoretical frameworks underpin them, and how context — such as political debates, new archival discoveries or changing historical fashions — has shaped those judgements. Always note provenance, authorial purpose and audience for each source and interpretation; provenance is central when you are explaining reliability and usefulness.

## Planning, structure and presentation of the essay
A clear plan is essential. A strong essay ordinarily opens with a concise introduction that sets the historical context of the question, defines the terms of the enquiry and signals the argument and structure. The body of the essay should be organised so that points about interpretations and sources are integrated rather than siloed: analyse an interpretation, show how source evidence supports or undermines it, evaluate provenance and limitations, and then move to the next line of argument. You can organise the essay thematically, chronologically or as a dialogue between interpretations, but the structure must build logically to a final, substantiated judgement. Sources should be embedded in the text at relevant points and copies or extracts inserted in the main body where they directly illuminate the argument; each source must be accompanied by clear references to origin and provenance. Every page should be numbered, a word count supplied, and a bibliography provided with full bibliographic details. Use ICT for research, drafting and presentation, and adopt a consistent referencing style (for example Harvard or footnote‑based), ensuring that the moderator can locate every source you used.

## Conduct, supervision and academic integrity
Your teacher will guide you through research skills and may run a short course on historiography and source evaluation, but the NEA is independently researched. Teachers must supervise and monitor work as it develops, keep records of that supervision, and be satisfied that the submitted work is the candidate’s own. You must retain rough notes, research logs, annotated drafts and any files that show the development of your essay; these materials are evidence that the essay is your independent work and may be requested during moderation. Teachers can give general feedback during drafting but must not substantially re‑write or add material. All candidates must sign a declaration that the work submitted is original and centres must countersign to confirm their validation checks. Plagiarism is treated seriously; any work that is not your own or that improperly uses other writers’ words or ideas without acknowledgement will be penalised.

## Marking, internal moderation and external moderation
Assessment is carried out in the centre by your teacher using the WJEC mark scheme. Teachers must annotate scripts to show how marks have been awarded against the criteria and provide summative comments. When more than one teacher marks work in a centre, internal standardisation is required so that marking is consistent. A sample of scripts and associated documentation will then be sent for external moderation. Moderators check that the mark scheme has been applied accurately, that appropriate sources and historiography were used, and that academic integrity has been observed. Keep a clear bibliography, provenance notes for each source and a research log to facilitate moderation. WJEC will ask centres to provide candidate declaration forms and a completed NEA coversheet for each submission.

## How marks are won: what distinguishes stronger work
High‑quality NEAs demonstrate secure, well‑organised historical knowledge deployed in analytical rather than descriptive ways, and they build a sustained, well‑substantiated judgement. For AO2, top essays do more than quote sources; they interrogate provenance, purpose, audience and reliability, and use that interrogation to support an argument. For AO3, the best work goes beyond summarising historians’ positions and explains why interpretations differ: it shows sensitivity to historiographical context, to changing evidence or to differing methodologies and assumptions. Strong essays interweave source evaluation and historiography so that sources are used to test interpretations and interpretations are used to frame the significance of sources. Weak essays tend to separate narrative, source commentary and historiography into discrete sections that do not cohere, or rely on a narrow set of materials and a single viewpoint.

## Submission, administration and common practicalities
Practically, centres must submit the NEA proposal before you begin and receive approval. You should not begin research until that approval arrives. The essay must be between 3,000 and 4,000 words; remember that verbatim extracts from sources and interpretations do not count towards the word limit, but lengthy unattributed quotations are poor practice. Include a clear word count on the front page. Every source you used should be referenced precisely so moderators can check them. If a centre reuses a title it may do so for up to three years; centres may set up to four different titles per cohort. When planning time, allow sufficient weeks for research, teacher feedback on draft structure, revision and final drafting, because teachers must retain oversight and declare authenticity. Centres will confirm entries and follow the WJEC timetable for submission and moderation.

## Exam technique
Treat the NEA as a sustained, timed project rather than a conventional exam question. Begin by refining a sharply finessed question and mapping the arguments you will need to address. Create a research plan that identifies eight to ten sources early; aim to include a mixture of contemporary primary material and later scholarly interpretations. As you read, keep a research log recording provenance, date, author, intended audience and your initial evaluation of usefulness. When you draft, write a focused introduction that sets context, defines the terms of the question and outlines your line of argument. Structure the main body so that each paragraph or section advances the argument: present an interpretation, show relevant source evidence, evaluate that evidence’s strengths and limitations (provenance, bias, scope), and explain how this affects the interpretation. Always make historiography work for you: explain why historians disagree — whether because they use different sources, apply different conceptual frameworks, or write from different political or chronological perspectives — and use that explanation to qualify your own judgement. Keep source analysis integrated into your argument instead of tacking it on as a separate feature. Conclude with a measured, evidence‑based judgement that recognises complexity and uncertainty rather than a simplistic verdict. Proofread and check presentation, include a bibliography and page numbers, provide the word count, and ensure all drafts and notes are retained. Finally, be honest about the limits of your evidence: acknowledging ambiguity and showing why a particular interpretation is more convincing in light of the available sources is much more persuasive than overstating certainty.
