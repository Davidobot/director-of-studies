# Europe in the Age of Absolutism & Revolution (c.1682–1815) (A-level History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of the period and key themes
The period c.1682–1815 traces a transition from consolidated absolutist states and early modern diplomatic rivalries into revolutionary upheaval and the reordering of Europe under the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. Across these years rulers experimented with centralised administration, standing armies and mercantilist economies; intellectual currents associated with the Enlightenment challenged traditional authority; and the late eighteenth century saw political crises that culminated in the French Revolution and its European ripple effects. To understand this period it helps to follow three strands at once: the internal transformation of states (administration, law, economy, society), the personalities and policies of leading rulers, and the international system of alliances and wars that shaped Great Power relations. Themes you will meet repeatedly are the drive for fiscal and military competence, attempts to modernise society from above (so-called “enlightened absolutism”), the tensions between traditional elites and new bureaucratic or military classes, and the way revolutionary ideas spread, were resisted or were harnessed by leaders.

## Russia under Peter the Great: modernisation and expansion
Peter the Great is a crucial figure for the opening decades of this period. Coming to effective power in the 1690s, Peter pushed a deliberate programme of westernisation intended to transform Russia from a landlocked, feudal realm into a major European power. His reforms reorganised the military along Western lines, created a navy that would be decisive in the Great Northern War, restructured taxation and administration to support larger standing forces, and subordinated the Russian Orthodox Church to state control through the Holy Synod. The founding of St Petersburg in 1703 symbolised a new outward orientation: a “window to Europe” placed on contested Baltic littoral. Peter’s successes in the Great Northern War (1700–1721) secured Russia’s access to the Baltic and a place among the Great Powers, but his reforms were uneven in social effect. Nobles were co-opted by service requirements and rewards, peasants remained subject to severe obligations, and the state’s fiscal and military transformation set patterns of centralised power that lasted into the nineteenth century.

When teaching Peter’s Russia, emphasise the mix of coercion and innovation in reform: recruitment, conscription and forced cultural changes were as important as imported technology. Discuss also limits: the largely agrarian economy, serfdom’s persistence, and the degree to which Peter’s changes created long-term structural capacities rather than immediate liberalisation.

## Prussia and Frederick the Great: disciplined state and the image of the “enlightened despot”
Prussia under Frederick II (the Great) illustrates a different model of modernisation that combined military strength with selective reform. Frederick inherited and expanded a highly efficient administrative and military machine built by his predecessors. His reign (1740–1786) is noted for victories in the Silesian Wars and for Prussia’s emergence as a major northern power. Frederick pursued legal and bureaucratic reforms, patronised arts and philosophy, and corresponded with leading Enlightenment thinkers, leading some historians to label him an “enlightened despot.”

A balanced classroom approach stresses both the substance and the limits of this label. Frederick’s judicial and administrative reforms strengthened rational governance, but his rule retained harsh military discipline, serfdom persisted in rural areas, and Prussia’s strength depended on an oversized army relative to population and resources. Discuss the relationship between war and reform: the need to sustain a powerful army drove taxation and centralisation, while military prestige shaped state identity and diplomatic leverage.

## France to 1789: fiscal crisis, social structure and the path to revolution
By the mid-eighteenth century France remained the most populous European polity but suffered from structural weaknesses that fed the revolutionary crisis of 1789. The ancien régime combined a complex fiscal system, privilege-exempting elites, and an over-centralised monarchy with an inefficient taxation base. Wars in the eighteenth century, notably the Seven Years’ War, and later support for the American Revolution, enlarged the state’s debts and amplified calls for fiscal reform. Attempts by ministers such as Turgot, Necker and Calonne to reform taxation and state spending met resistance from privileged estates and court factions, and the summoning of the Estates-General in 1789 became the opening of the political crisis.

When exploring pre-revolutionary France, move beyond the caricature of a corrupt court. Students should trace how economic pressures, demographic patterns, agricultural distress, and the spread of Enlightenment political discourse combined to make reform difficult and political conflict explosive. The Revolution itself must be taught as both a political and social rupture: constitutional experiments, radicalisation, and the redefinition of sovereignty produced multiple phases with different dynamics.

## Great Power relations to 1756: alliances, rivalry and the Diplomatic Revolution
The balance of power in the first half of the eighteenth century was fluid and driven by dynastic claims, colonial competition and shifting continental interests. The War of the Spanish Succession and later conflicts illustrated how wars on the continent and overseas were increasingly linked. By the mid-century the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756—when traditional enemies France and Austria allied, while Britain supported Prussia—reconfigured alliance patterns and presaged the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763), a global war fought in Europe, North America, India and at sea. The Seven Years’ War marked a turning point: Britain’s naval and colonial gains accelerated its imperial ascendancy, while Prussia’s survival established it as a major land power. The strain of prolonged warfare also hardened fiscal and administrative practices across Europe, making permanent standing armies and sophisticated state machinery more necessary.

Teaching diplomacy for this period benefits from a focus on the logic of alliance-making. Explain why states swapped partners: the desire to check a hegemonic rival, secure territorial gains, or protect dynastic interests. Use a few case studies—Mulgrave’s diplomacy, Frederick’s calculations in 1756, or the Anglo-French naval contests—to show how grand strategy intersected with immediate political pressures.

## Diplomacy, revolution and the Napoleonic reordering, 1756–1815
The final decades of the period are dominated by the French Revolution and Napoleon’s wars, which transformed the diplomatic, military and ideological map of Europe. The revolutionary wars began as defensive struggles but soon carried revolutionary aims abroad, provoking coalitions of monarchical powers determined to contain France. Napoleon’s rise created an empire that exported legal and administrative templates—Napoleonic codes, secularisation of institutions and meritocratic bureaucracies—while also provoking nationalist reactions. The scale of mobilisation was unprecedented: mass conscription and the levée en masse produced armies capable of sustaining long campaigns, and the sheer demands of total war drove innovations in logistics, conscription policy and state control of economies.

By 1815 the Congress of Vienna attempted to restore balance and stability, re-establishing conservative monarchies while creating a diplomatic framework intended to prevent another hegemon. In the classroom consider both the destructive and constructive legacies: the suppression of local liberties and the imposition of foreign rule contrast with the diffusion of legal reforms and the political language of rights that inspired future national movements. Encourage students to think about continuity and change together—how did the Napoleonic period accelerate trends already underway, and where did it create genuinely new political dynamics?

## Exam technique
Answering essay questions on this option requires clarity about what the question asks and disciplined use of evidence across the period. Begin by unpacking command words: “assess the significance”, “to what extent”, “explain why” all demand different emphases—significance requires weighing importance relative to alternatives, “to what extent” asks for measured judgement and qualification. Plan an argument before writing and ensure every paragraph links to the question; stray narrative without analysis costs marks. For Unit 1-style essays, AO1 dominates: you must demonstrate secure factual knowledge, make comparisons across the period (changes, continuities, causes and consequences) and reach a substantiated judgement. Use specific examples—dates, events, names and policies—to support points, and where appropriate show change over time (for example, comparing Peter’s early reforms with longer-term social effects, or contrasting pre- and post-1756 alliance systems).

When source evaluation is required in other units, always place a source in context before using it: consider who produced it, when, why and how that affects its reliability and utility. For AO3 tasks or the NEA, historiography matters: present differing interpretations, explain why historians might disagree (source base, political context, theoretical outlook), and use this to refine your own judgement. Avoid treating historians as authorities to be cited as decoration; instead use interpretations as evidence to be weighed and critiqued.

Time management in exams is critical. Allocate time to plan, write and revise; a brief plan ensures essays remain focused. Structure answers with clear topic sentences that signpost argument development, and end with a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. In longer essays aim to integrate analytical comment into your narrative rather than tacking analysis on at the end. Practice writing synoptic paragraphs that link political, social and economic factors—examiners reward breadth of understanding that remains tightly focused on the question.

Finally, use past questions to practise forming balanced arguments under timed conditions. Annotate model responses to identify techniques that win marks (clear thesis, well-chosen evidence, engagement with counter-arguments, and precise historiographical awareness). Regular, targeted practice will make the intellectual demands of c.1682–1815 manageable and will help you present answers that are historically informed, coherent and persuasive.
