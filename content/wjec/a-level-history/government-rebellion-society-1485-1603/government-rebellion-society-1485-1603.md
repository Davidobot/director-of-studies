# Government, Rebellion & Society in Wales & England (c.1485–1603) (A-level History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction
This option asks you to hold a wide chronological sweep in your mind while focusing on a number of connected themes: how government was consolidated and practised across the Tudor century, how religion re-ordered politics and society, why rebellions occurred and how the state responded, and how social and economic change reshaped communities in both England and Wales. The period begins with the fragile settlement of Henry VII after Bosworth (1485) and closes with the succession of James VI of Scotland to the English throne in 1603. Across this cycle of three Tudor reigns — Henry VII/Henry VIII, Edward VI/Mary I and Elizabeth I — students must make comparative judgments about continuity and change, explain causes and consequences, and be ready to deploy short-range case studies alongside long-term trends.

## Political consolidation and government (1485–1603)
After 1485 the central concern of government was stability. Henry VII established a cautious, fiscally-minded monarchy that aimed to neutralise magnate power. He developed new administrative and financial methods, using bonds, recognisances and the Council Learned in the Law to extract control and income from the nobility; these methods were not always popular, but they did reduce the risk of aristocratic rebellion and raised the crown’s resources. Henry VIII’s reign marked a different transformation: an energetic king reshaped government to pursue dynastic glory and, from the 1530s, a major constitutional break with Rome which in practice enhanced royal control. Henry relied on powerful ministers: Wolsey’s predominance in the 1510s-20s showed the importance of personal government and legal administration, while Cromwell’s reorganisation of government in the 1530s laid the foundations for a more bureaucratic state, using Parliament as an instrument to give legal force to major policies.

Under Edward VI and especially in Elizabeth I’s reign, the role of ministers and the Privy Council became more institutionalised. The mid-century regency governments exposed the limits of factional rule, whereas Elizabeth’s long reign demonstrated the flexibility of a monarchy working through councillors (Cecil, Walsingham) and a selective use of Parliament. Parliament’s growing importance lay not just in legislation but in supplying taxation and political legitimacy; it remained, however, a consultative partner rather than an independent source of power. The Tudor state increasingly combined personal monarchy, a professional administration and coercive regional structures to govern a complex society.

## Religious change and its effects (1529–1588)
Religion lies at the heart of this period. The Henrician Reformation began as a dynastic and personal crisis — the King’s “Great Matter” — but became a structural revolution when Henry asserted royal supremacy over the Church in England. The dissolution of the monasteries (1536–1540) had far-reaching consequences: it removed a major social and economic institution, redistributed considerable landed wealth to lay owners, and altered local patterns of charity and authority. Edward VI’s government pushed Protestant reform further, introducing liturgical change and doctrinal reform that unsettled many communities.

Mary I’s brief counter-reformation (1553–1558) attempted to restore Catholicism and papal authority, producing persecution of Protestants that has since shaped historical debate. Elizabeth I’s settlement after 1558 aimed to establish a via media: the 1559 Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy created a national church with an ambiguous theology and an outward conformity enforced by the state. The Settlement’s moderation masked continued contestation. Puritan critics sought further reformation; Catholic recusants hoped for foreign or domestic reversal of Protestant establishment. From the 1570s onwards the papal bull excommunicating Elizabeth and the intensification of international Catholic plots increased the political stakes of religious division and pushed the English crown towards firmer measures against Catholics.

When you study religious change, balance doctrinal developments with social and institutional consequences. Think about parish life, the fate of former monastic properties, the role of preaching and literacy, and the ways local elites used religion to assert influence.

## Rebellion, protest and the state's response (1509–1569)
Rebellion in the Tudor period ranged from dynastic threats soon after 1485 to popular uprisings in response to economic, social or religious pressures. Major conspiracies and rebellions are pivotal case studies for this option because they reveal the causes of unrest and the effectiveness of Tudor government.

Henry VIII’s reign saw the Pilgrimage of Grace (1536), a large-scale northern uprising against religious and economic policies that combined conservative religious motives with local grievances about taxation and social order. The mid-century rebellions of 1549 — the Western Rising in Devon and Cornwall and Kett’s Rebellion in Norfolk — illustrate different dynamics: the Western Rising combined opposition to religious change with resentment over economic and social pressures, while Kett’s movement focused sharply on enclosure and local corruption. Under Mary, Wyatt’s Rebellion (1554) illustrated the interweaving of religious fear and opposition to a Spanish marriage. Later, the Northern Earls’ rising in 1569 showed how Catholic nobles could be drawn into rebellion by both religious conviction and dynastic calculation.

The state’s responses varied. Punitive repression, targeted executions and the use of martial force were features, but so were negotiation and selective concessions. The crown learned to combine surveillance, local governance through trusted officials, legal punishments and propaganda to deter and contain unrest. In essays, use rebellions to probe the limits of Tudor authority and to test arguments about the extent of popular grievance versus elite manipulation.

## Social and economic change in the sixteenth century
The sixteenth century was a period of substantial social and economic transition. Population growth put pressure on prices and land, contributing to inflation and repeated poor harvests that created insecurity for the poor. Enclosure and the consolidation of estates altered traditional agrarian relations and generated visible conflicts, especially where customary rights were undermined. Urban growth and the expansion of trade fostered the development of a renewed merchant class, while the gentry expanded in wealth and political importance, often benefiting from the acquisition of former monastic lands.

Industry and overseas commerce grew unevenly. Cloth production and export linked English towns to continental markets, while ports and merchant networks contributed to rising prosperity for some. At the same time, many people experienced acute poverty, and official attitudes toward vagrancy hardened; Tudor legislation gradually moved from punitive measures to a more organised—if limited—system of poor relief. The social changes had cultural consequences too: increasing literacy, the spread of printing, and new ideas about gentility and social mobility all reshaped people’s expectations and identities. When you write about social and economic change, avoid seeing only decline or only improvement; emphasise regional variation and the ways economic change affected distinct groups differently.

## Wales and its integration with England after 1530
Wales experienced both integration and distinctive developments under the Tudors. The Acts of Union (1536 and 1543) legally incorporated Wales into the English legal and administrative system, abolishing many marcher privileges and introducing English county organisation. This created clearer government structures and extended English law, but it also produced tensions over language, local rights, and representation. The Council of Wales and the Marches became an important instrument of regional governance, administering justice and extending royal authority.

Cultural and religious policies had significant effects in Wales. The translation of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer into Welsh (the full Protestant Welsh Bible translation being completed by William Morgan in 1588) was crucial for the Protestant settlement’s penetration into Welsh-language communities and for preserving Welsh as a liturgical language. The Welsh gentry increasingly participated in the English administrative world, creating new social pathways but also accelerating anglicising pressures. In essays, treat Wales both as part of the English polity and as a region with its own social, legal and linguistic dynamics; use local examples to show how national policies played out across different communities.

## Exam technique
Answering Unit 1 questions successfully requires clear organisation, purposeful use of evidence and an awareness of the question’s demand for concepts such as change, continuity, cause and consequence. Begin by reading the question carefully and underlining its focus words: does it ask you to assess the significance, the extent of change, causes, or the effectiveness of government? Spend a few minutes drafting a brief plan that sets out your argument in a thesis sentence and a sequence of linked paragraphs. Each paragraph should open with a clear topic sentence, develop an argument supported by factual detail and example (for instance, Pilgrimage of Grace, Kett’s Rebellion, the Acts of Union, dissolution of monasteries), and end by linking back to the question.

Use precise evidence to support points: ministers (Wolsey, Cromwell, Cecil), specific laws (Acts of 1536 and 1543), parliamentary measures (Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity), notable rebellions and their dates, and social indicators (enclosure, population pressure, growth of the gentry). Avoid dumping disconnected facts; instead integrate them into analysis that evaluates significance. When the question invites you to judge change over time, explicitly compare earlier and later periods and explain causation as well as consequence. For 40–50 minute essays, allocate time for introduction, two to four developed analytical paragraphs, and a concise conclusion that makes a sustained judgement.

Where appropriate, demonstrate awareness of interpretations and debate in concise terms: mention competing explanations (for example whether the Henrician Reformation was driven by genuine reformist conviction or dynastic need) and explain which evidence you find most convincing. Use a formal, balanced tone and watch the clock so that the strongest evidence appears in the middle paragraphs. Finally, practise by writing timed essays on key topics and asking teachers for targeted feedback on argument structure and use of historical detail.
