# Depth Study: Source Analysis & Interpretations (Units 2 & 4) (A-level History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview of the depth-study approach
The WJEC / Eduqas A-level in History asks you to develop both broad chronological knowledge and concentrated, investigative skill. Units 2 and 4 together form a single depth study taken across AS and A2: Unit 2 concentrates on the earlier phase of a chosen topic and Unit 4 continues that same topic into later years. These two papers place a particular emphasis on handling contemporary source material and on the historian’s craft of interpretation. The aim is not simply to recall facts but to use evidence and debate to produce reasoned, historically rooted judgements. As you revise, bear in mind that depth study questions reward a balance of contextual knowledge, careful source evaluation and an awareness of historiographical argument.

## How the specification is structured and what that means for you
The course is unitised: two AS units and three A2 units together make the full A-level. The depth study is a linked pair: Part 1 at AS (Unit 2) and Part 2 at A2 (Unit 4). In Unit 2 you will be introduced to the earlier phase and practised on source evaluation and on explanation of differing interpretations. In Unit 4 the source work becomes broader and often more demanding, and essays expect you to draw on the whole depth study where appropriate. You must choose one depth topic from a set list that ranges from Tudor England and mid‑eighteenth century France to Weimar Germany and the American Civil War. Note the combination rule: if your Unit 1 period study is on Wales and England you must choose a non‑British depth study for Units 2 and 4, and vice versa. This rule preserves breadth in knowledge across the qualification.

## Assessment objectives and what examiners are looking for
There are three assessment objectives. AO1 expects you to demonstrate and organise factual knowledge and to use it to explain cause, consequence, change, continuity, similarity, difference and significance. AO2 requires analysis and evaluation of source material that is primary and/or contemporary to the period, assessed within its historical context. AO3 assesses your ability to explain how and why historians have constructed different interpretations of the past. On the full A-level these objectives are weighted so that AO1 carries the largest share, AO2 is significant and AO3 is also a substantial component. For Units 2 and 4 you will be tested on all three objectives: source evaluation and contextual knowledge are examined in compulsory source questions, and interpretative judgment is tested in compulsory interpretation questions. Always aim to combine direct use of the sources with your own contextual knowledge: the marks reward both.

## What each depth‑study paper asks you to do
Unit 2 (Part 1) typically asks you to analyse three short sources: you must consider their content, provenance where relevant, the message and the usefulness of each piece for answering the set question. The interpretation question in Unit 2 asks you to evaluate contrasting accounts of an issue from historians and to explain why these interpretations differ. Unit 4 (Part 2) builds on this by giving source material of greater range and complexity: there may be more implicit assumptions to unpack and more scope to deploy wider contextual knowledge from both Part 1 and Part 2 of the depth study. The essay question in Unit 4 often calls for a synthetised judgement that draws on the whole depth study. For example, in the Mid‑Tudor depth study you will use sources about religious change, rebellions such as the Pilgrimage of Grace or Kett’s Rebellion and you will be expected to bring in knowledge about the Acts of Union with Wales, the impact of enclosure, and the political role of figures such as Cromwell and Somerset. In the Germany depth study you will combine analysis of Weimar sources (hyperinflation, reparations, political instability) with later Nazi sources (propaganda, legal changes) to show continuity and change.

## Practical guidance for handling sources and interpretations (AO2 & AO3)
Always begin a source question by placing the extract briefly in its historical context: what is the basic situation that the source addresses? Then work through the source’s content, explaining what it actually says and what it implies. Consider provenance: who produced the source, when and for what audience and purpose? That leads naturally to evaluating strengths and limitations. A troop movement report from 1940 might be accurate about numbers but partial about morale; a government speech can reveal official policy but not private motivations. Next, compare and corroborate: note agreements and contradictions between the three sources and bring in your own knowledge to test claims. Avoid treating provenance as a tick‑box; use it to explain why the source might present a particular angle and how far that affects its reliability for the question. For interpretation questions, identify the central claim of each historian, summarise the evidence each uses, and explain why historians might disagree. Differences frequently arise from access to new evidence, differing ideological perspectives (for example, Marxist, revisionist or post‑revisionist approaches), methodological emphasis (political narrative versus social history), or the historian’s national and temporal context. A strong response will show how the available sources support or challenge each interpretation and will conclude with a reasoned judgement explaining which interpretation you find more convincing and why.

## Preparing Unit 5 (Historical Interpretations) and doing independent research
Unit 5 is a 3,000–4,000 word non‑examination assessment in which you investigate an historical issue through the lens of interpretation. Your enquiry must be approved by WJEC before you begin, and the centre will submit a proposal form. Choose an issue that is genuinely debatable rather than a simple factual question: for example, “Was the main cause of the French Revolution financial crisis or rising political expectations?” or “How far did the New Deal transform American society?” You must research and supply a deliberate range of evidence — typically eight to ten sources — and you must engage with at least two contrasting historical interpretations. The essay should integrate source analysis with historiography: show how primary evidence supports or undermines particular interpretations, explain why historians have reached different conclusions, and end with a clear, substantiated judgement. Keep careful records, cite sources precisely and include a bibliography. Teachers may guide your development and may comment on drafts in general terms, but the work must be your own: keep drafts and notes as evidence of independent research and remember to sign the authenticity declaration. Centres submit work for external moderation and must follow WJEC guidance on approval, monitoring and plagiarism.

## Exam technique
Approach each question with a clear plan. For source questions spend the first minute placing the source in context and the next ten to fifteen minutes analysing provenance, content and utility, using your own knowledge to test and extend the source’s claims. Always compare sources directly: a paragraph that contrasts two or three sources and then brings in specific contextual facts scores highly. For interpretation questions identify the central contention of each interpretation, explain the evidence and reasoning behind them, and assess them against both the sources provided and your wider knowledge before reaching a reasoned judgement. For essays allocate time to planning, writing and checking: introduce the issue clearly, structure the argument into coherent paragraphs each focused on one line of reasoning, and conclude by weighing up the evidence. Use topic sentences that make an explicit argument, and signal historiographical debate when relevant. Write with precision and keep your handwriting legible if sitting written exams. Finally, practise exam conditions: timed source analyses and full essays build fluency in using evidence, balancing interpretations and crafting substantiated judgements — the core skills that Units 2 and 4 demand.
