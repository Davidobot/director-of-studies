# Government, Revolution & Society in Wales & England (c.1603–1715) (A-level History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: the period and its big questions
The years c.1603–1715 encompass one of the most turbulent and transformative stretches in the history of Wales and England: the transition from Tudor settlement to Stuart rule, the breakdown of politics that produced civil war and regicide, a republican experiment, the Restoration of the monarchy, and the revolutionary settlement of 1688–89 that reshaped monarchy, Parliament and party politics. For students, the period should be approached through a small set of interconnected big questions. How secure was royal authority and why did it crack? In what ways did Parliament grow in confidence and capacity? How did religion, local grievance and economic pressures combine to create protest and rebellion? What was the human cost of war and regime change, and how did ordinary people — gentry, townspeople, artisans and rural labourers — experience and respond to these changes? Thinking in terms of cause and consequence, continuity and change, and the competing interpretations historians offer will help you structure revision and exam answers.

## The early Stuarts: James I and the drift to crisis (1603–1642)
James I inherited an enlarged dynastic authority but faced immediate challenges. He strove to affirm royal prerogative while managing a more assertive political nation: Parliament expected to be consulted over taxation and law. James’s belief in the divine right of kings, together with unpopular court favourites and fiscal demands, created tensions that his personality and style of government failed to soothe. His son Charles I intensified the problem. The reign of Charles saw increasing disputes over taxation, religious policy and the limits of royal authority. Financial expedients such as forced loans, impositions and the controversial use of prerogative courts (e.g. Star Chamber) provoked legal and parliamentary resistance. On religion, Charles and Archbishop Laud promoted a high Anglicanism and ceremonial form of worship that many Puritans regarded as a drift towards popery. These political, fiscal and religious strains fed into a constitutional crisis: the Personal Rule (1629–1640) in which Charles attempted to govern without Parliament, and the later attempts by both sides to build political coalitions that could enforce their view of the constitution. Regional and imperial pressures — notably the Scottish Covenanters and unrest in Ireland — soon brought these tensions back into the open and made accommodation ever harder, setting the scene for civil war.

## Civil War, regicide and republican experiments (1642–1660)
War opened in 1642 when compromise failed and both king and Parliament mobilised armed forces. The conflict is best seen as a sequence of contestations: arguments over control of the armed forces, the question of the king’s advisors and ministers, the role of the army and the radicalisation that grew during wartime. Military innovation and leadership mattered: the New Model Army, with professional command and ideological cohesion, proved decisive. The war’s outcome included the capture, trial and execution of Charles I in 1649 — a radical constitutional rupture. The interregnum that followed was not a straightforward ‘republical utopia’ but a period of experimentation and contest about how to govern. The Rump Parliament sought reform, but instability and factionalism opened the way for Oliver Cromwell, who accepted the role of Lord Protector and oversaw a regime that combined military authority with some modernising reforms. Policies under the Commonwealth and Protectorate included efforts at religious toleration for certain dissenters, administrative reform, and controversial experiments in governance such as the Major‑Generals who enforced order in regions including Wales and the Marches. Historians debate Cromwell’s place: was he a pragmatic stabiliser or a military dictator? Understanding competing accounts helps when you evaluate interpretations in essays.

## The Restoration and the later Stuart challenge (1660–1688)
By 1660 the monarchy returned, but restoration did not mean a simple reversion. Charles II and his ministers re-established the Church of England and sought a settlement that would prevent future breakdowns while preserving royal dignity. The Clarendon Code and Test Acts limited dissent and sought to secure the restored settlement. Politically, the period saw sharp questions over the balance between crown and Parliament: the Exclusion Crisis of the late 1670s and early 1680s revealed deep anxiety about a Catholic succession. Religious fear was intensified by episodes such as the Popish Plot (fabricated allegations in 1678) and by James II’s open Catholicism when he succeeded in 1685. The period also saw the emergence of more recognisable party politics: the Whig and Tory labels began to reflect organised groupings and deep divisions about succession, toleration and the role of the crown.

## The Glorious Revolution and the revolutionary settlement to 1715
The deposition of James II in 1688 and the accession of William and Mary was titled “glorious” because it established a new constitutional framework without the prolonged violence of earlier revolution. The Settlement after 1689, with the Bill of Rights, the Toleration Act and the development of the Hanoverian succession, limited the monarchy’s arbitrary powers and established parliamentary supremacy in key respects. The Revolution still left open questions about the franchise, the powers of the crown in foreign policy, and religious liberty — Protestants benefited most from toleration, while Catholics remained excluded. The years to 1715 consolidated party politics and constitutional monarchy, but the succession of 1714 from the Stuarts to the Hanoverians produced a Jacobite challenge culminating in the 1715 rising. The settlement also had long-term consequences: it accelerated the shift towards a managed parliamentary system in which ministers, not monarchs, increasingly led government business in Parliament.

## Religion, radicalism and ideas: from sects to the Scientific Revolution
Religion was both cause and consequence across the period. High Anglicanism and Laudian ritual provoked Puritan resistance; the Civil War unleashed a proliferation of sects — Levellers, Diggers, Fifth Monarchists — many of which proposed radical social or religious change. The post‑Restoration settlement sought to check dissent while the Toleration Act carved out limited space for Protestant nonconformists. Intellectual change was equally important. Thomas Hobbes and John Locke produced seminal political thought: Hobbes justified strong sovereign power in the face of anarchy, while Locke’s later writings provided an intellectual foundation for constitutional government and religious toleration. Scientific advances, embodied institutionally by the Royal Society, reshaped assumptions about knowledge and authority. When addressing interpretations in essays, you should be prepared to compare religious motivations with political, economic and intellectual explanations for events: historians emphasize different factors and understanding these schools of thought is crucial for AO3 style questions.

## Society, economy and the Welsh experience
Economic change and social pressure shaped politics as much as high-level conflicts. Agricultural trends, inflation and local grievances contributed to unrest; the costs of war, taxation and requisitioning affected ordinary people’s livelihoods. Wales’s experience between 1603 and 1715 must be considered alongside England. Although a degree of political integration pre-dated this period, Wales had its own patterns of local government, gentry networks and religious life. During the Civil War many Welsh localities were broadly Royalist in allegiance, but there were important regional variations and episodes of local unrest. The Interregnum introduced administrative changes and the Major‑Generals’ rule brought direct military oversight to some parts of Wales and the Marches. Religious developments — including the growth of dissenting Protestant groups — had distinctive Welsh dimensions and political alignments. When writing essays you should weave in local examples from Wales where appropriate: they enrich argument and demonstrate the specification’s emphasis on the Welsh perspective.

## Exam technique
Exams in this option test three main skills: AO1 (knowledge argument and judgement), AO2 (source analysis), and AO3 (evaluation of historical interpretations). Time management begins in the revision room: learn the chronology so you can place sources and events immediately in context. For source questions, practise identifying each source’s provenance (who, when, why), summarising the content succinctly, and evaluating strengths and limitations in relation to the question. Use contextual knowledge to explain what a source can and cannot tell you, and compare sources to show corroboration or conflict. For essay questions, start with a clear thesis that answers the question directly, then structure the response so each paragraph makes a distinct analytical point supported by evidence and, where useful, historiographical perspective. Don’t simply narrate: link each paragraph back to the question and show the chain of cause and consequence. For AO3-type tasks draw explicitly on different schools of interpretation — for example Whig constitutional narratives, Marxist/class interpretations, and revisionist/localist accounts — and explain why historians reached contrasting conclusions given the evidence and their contexts. In timed exams allocate a proportionate time to each question and leave a few minutes at the end to check clarity and add a final paragraph that reinforces your judgement. Practise with past-style questions, mark your answers against the assessment objectives, and build concise ready-made examples and short quotations from primary sources to deploy fluently under exam conditions.
