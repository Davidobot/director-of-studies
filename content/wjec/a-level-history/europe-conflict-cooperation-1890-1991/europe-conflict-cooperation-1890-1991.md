# Europe: Conflict & Co-operation (c.1890–1991) (A-level History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Overview: a century of competing forces
The period c.1890–1991 is shaped by an intensifying interplay between conflict and co‑operation across Europe. At the opening of the period great‑power rivalry, imperial ambitions and military build‑ups point towards large‑scale war; by the end the map of Europe has been redrawn twice and the continent is divided and then gradually reunited through new structures of co‑operation. Students should treat this as an argument about processes as much as a sequence of events: how and why the same states moved from alliance and confrontation to international institutions, economic integration and détente, and how the persistence of ideological fault‑lines kept conflict alive in changing forms. Key long‑running threads to follow are the rise and fall of empires and empires of ideology (liberalism, nationalism, fascism, Communism), the changing balance of power, the experience and consequences of total war, and the institutions and ideas that attempted to manage or prevent conflict from 1919 onwards.

## International relations to 1939: alliances, war and the failure of collective security
The years 1890–1939 form a coherent phase in which diplomatic structures, military competition and crises produced two global wars. From the 1890s the system of alliances and ententes—Bismarckian isolation giving way to the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance—created rigid commitments that amplified regional disputes. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 exposed these commitments and turned a Balkan crisis into the First World War. Teach this period as a chain of interconnected causes: long‑term structural factors (industrialisation, naval and arms races, rival empires), short‑term triggers (crises of 1905–14, July Crisis), and contingency (decisions by political leaders). The peace settlement of 1919–23 attempted to reorder Europe through new nation‑states and international organisations. The League of Nations represented a novel attempt at collective security, yet it lacked the participation of key powers, had no enforcement mechanism and failed to restrain revisionist regimes in the 1930s. The economic dislocations of the 1920s and successful revisionist foreign policies—Japanese aggression in Asia, Italian expansionism in Africa, and German revisionism under the Nazis—highlight how fragile the post‑war order was. The policy of appeasement in the late 1930s is best understood in terms of memory of 1914–18, domestic politics, economic limits and calculations about the balance of power; students should be prepared to evaluate whether appeasement was cowardice, miscalculation or a pragmatic attempt to buy time.

## Italy 1918–1945: from post‑war crisis to fascist dictatorship
Italy illustrates the domestic stresses behind interwar revisionism. After the First World War Italy suffered economic disruption, social unrest, fears of socialist revolution and a sense of wounded national pride over alleged “mutilated gains.” These conditions created fertile ground for Benito Mussolini and the Fascist movement, which combined anti‑liberal rhetoric, aggressive nationalism and a promise to restore order. Between 1922 and the mid‑1930s the Mussolini regime consolidated power by eliminating legitimate political opposition, controlling the press and reshaping institutions through corporatism rather than socialism or liberal democracy. In foreign policy Mussolini alternated between opportunistic collaboration with and competition against other powers: the invasion of Ethiopia (1935–36), intervention in the Spanish Civil War, and the 1939 pact with Hitler show both ambition and strategic overreach. The Italian case allows students to explore themes of legitimacy, the transformation of mass politics, the role of violence and propaganda, and the limits of authoritarian modernisation. When assessing the fascist period, it is important to balance the regime’s social and administrative reforms against human costs, colonial violence and military failure.

## Germany 1918–1945: Weimar instability, Nazi revolution and catastrophe
Germany’s trajectory from imperial defeat to dictatorship and European war is central to the period. The collapse of the Kaiserreich in 1918 produced the Weimar Republic, which faced crippling economic problems, political fragmentation and the stigma of Versailles. These structural weaknesses, together with political violence and cultural polarisation, created openings for radical movements. The National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP) mobilised mass support through promises of national revival, anti‑Communism, anti‑Semitism and charismatic leadership. Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor in 1933 was followed by rapid legal and extra‑legal measures to consolidate power: the Enabling Act, Gleichschaltung (coordination), and the destruction of democratic institutions. Nazi policies combined economic measures aimed at recovery and rearmament with racial persecution culminating in the Holocaust. Students should examine how ideology, economic policy, and institutional changes combined to produce a totalitarian state and how foreign policy—reoccupation of the Rhineland, Anschluss, Munich, and the invasion of Poland—was linked to both ideological aims and strategic calculations. The German case is rich for analyses of causes and responsibility, the role of contingency, and the connections between domestic transformation and international aggression.

## Russia 1905–1945: revolution, civil war and Stalinist state‑building
Russia’s conversion from imperial autocracy to Soviet superpower between 1905 and 1945 is another pillar of the theme. The 1905 revolution revealed the crisis of Tsarist rule and foreshadowed 1917, when war, food shortages and political collapse produced the February and October revolutions. The Bolshevik seizure of power led to civil war, foreign intervention and the consolidation of Communist rule under Lenin, who introduced the New Economic Policy to stabilise the state. After Lenin’s death Stalin emerged as leader and embarked on rapid industrialisation, forced collectivisation and a brutal campaign against perceived enemies. Stalinist modernisation transformed Soviet society and enabled the USSR to become a major military power, but at immense human cost. The Soviet experience is vital for understanding 20th‑century conflict because it created a rival ideological bloc and a state willing to pursue expansionist policies in security‑driven terms. Students should trace continuities between revolutionary rhetoric and later state practice, the causes and effects of economic transformation, and Soviet foreign policy choices that shaped the wartime alliance and post‑war order.

## Europe after 1945: division, reconstruction and the politics of détente
The Second World War left Europe devastated and divided into Western and Soviet spheres. The immediate post‑war years saw the creation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan and the foundation of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, institutions that embodied both co‑operation and strategic rivalry. Economic recovery in the West underpins the story of co‑operation: the Marshall Plan and steps towards European economic integration—ECSC, EEC and later the European Community—were driven by security concerns, economic logic and a desire to bind former adversaries together. In the East, Soviet control produced centrally planned economies and political repression, while Soviet security priorities shaped the expansion of Communist regimes. The Cold War is not simply two blocks staring at each other: it includes episodes of crisis (Berlin, Cuba), competition in the third world, proxy wars, and periods of negotiation and détente. The 1960s and 1970s display both confrontation and negotiation; by the late 1970s and 1980s, economic stagnation, reform pressures and Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost and perestroika led to the thawing of relations and ultimately the end of the Soviet empire in Europe by 1991. Teaching this period should emphasise both structural causes (military stalemate, nuclear deterrence, economic competition) and agency (leaders’ choices, popular movements in Eastern Europe, negotiated settlements).

## Themes, concepts and how to use them
Across the century students must be able to apply and explain core historical concepts: causation, continuity and change, significance, similarity and difference. Conflict and co‑operation are lenses rather than exhaustive labels: for example, alliances can be mechanisms of co‑operation that produce conflict, and economic integration can be both cause and effect of political stabilisation. Encourage pupils to frame essays around a clear argument that relates specific evidence—diplomatic correspondence, political speeches, economic data, legislation—to broader conceptual claims. Useful exemplars include comparing the aims and outcomes of the League of Nations and the United Nations to show institutional learning and limits, or analysing how nationalism expressed itself differently in Italy, Germany and the successor states of empires. Chronology matters: students should map short‑term crises within long‑term developments (for example, how the trauma of 1914–18 shaped interwar appeasement and post‑1945 security thinking). Always stress scales of analysis—local, national, international—and the relationship between domestic politics and foreign policy decisions.

## Interpreting the past: sources and historiography
Effective revision depends on combining primary evidence with engagement in historiographical debate. Primary sources—diplomatic documents, party manifestos, government legislation, speeches, contemporary newspapers and visual propaganda—provide direct access to intentions, rhetoric and perception. Teaching should guide learners to interrogate provenance, purpose and audience when using sources and to place them in context rather than treating them as self‑evident facts. Equally important is historiography: students should be comfortable summarising major interpretations (for example, structuralist accounts of the causes of the First World War versus intentionalist or contingency interpretations; interpretations of appeasement as moral failure versus strategic necessity; debates over whether the Cold War was driven by Soviet expansionism or Western containment). Unit 5 (NEA) in the WJEC specification explicitly rewards understanding of why historians differ and how interpretations change over time. Practically, revision should practise turning historiographical summaries into evidence for and against a judgment, and using a small number of well‑chosen historians to structure an essay's argument.

## Exam technique
Plan each answer so that it opens with a clear argument in response to the question, followed by thematic paragraphs that each make a point and use specific evidence to support it. For essays on change and continuity, set out the end and the beginning clearly and show the processes linking them. In source‑based questions, always address provenance early (who, when, why), evaluate content in context, and use outside knowledge to corroborate or challenge the source. When asked about interpretations, identify the interpretation succinctly, explain its basis, assess its strengths and weaknesses with reference to evidence and alternative views, and reach a balanced conclusion that weighs the historiography. Time management is essential: allocate minutes for planning, writing and reviewing; short planning notes prevent drift and ensure each paragraph advances the argument. Use topic sentences that signpost the line of argument, integrate names, dates and specific examples to score AO1, analyse source bias and utility to meet AO2, and discuss historians’ perspectives for AO3. Finally, practice past questions under timed conditions, review examiner reports for common pitfalls, and refine answers so they remain analytical, focused and historically informed.
