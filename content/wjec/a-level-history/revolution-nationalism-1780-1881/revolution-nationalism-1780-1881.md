# Revolution & Nationalism in Europe (c.1780–1881) (A-level History WJEC / Eduqas)

## Introduction: themes and chronology
The period c.1780–1881 in Europe is dominated by the interplay of revolution and the rise of nationalism. From the shock of the French Revolution and the wars of Napoleon to the nation-building projects of Italy and Germany, and the reform and reaction in states such as Russia and France, this century reshaped political boundaries, social structures and political language. Students should approach the period as a series of connected processes: revolutionary upheaval and conservative reaction; the transmission of political ideas (liberalism, republicanism, socialism); and the increasingly potent idea of nationhood that could mobilise populations for unity or division. Chronologically, the study ranges from the pre-revolutionary stresses of the 1780s, through the Napoleonic era and the Congress of Vienna, into the waves of 1830 and 1848, and finishes with the consolidation of national states by the 1870s and the Russian collapse and reaction up to 1881.

## The revolutionary legacy and European reaction, c.1780–1856
The French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic wars had an immense and ambiguous legacy. On the one hand they exported ideas of citizenship, legal equality and secular administration, and on the other they provoked a conservative reaction embodied by the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815) and the Concert of Europe. The Congress sought to restore dynastic order, redraw frontiers and create a framework for great-power cooperation, yet it could not erase the political language unleashed by 1789. The early nineteenth century saw both the repression of liberal and nationalist movements under Metternich’s Austria and sporadic uprisings — notably in 1820–23 and in 1830 — where constitutionalist and national aspirations resurfaced in Spain, Italy and Poland. The Revolutions of 1848 represented the high point of this revolutionary cycle: they were transnational in scope and mixed liberal, nationalist and social demands, but most failed to secure their objectives in the short term, often because of divisions among revolutionaries and the strength of conservative forces. Even failure carried consequences: it encouraged new strategies, such as the turn towards "realpolitik" and state-led unification, and exposed the limits of the old order. The Crimean War (1853–1856) then punctured several assumptions of European diplomacy, undermined the Concert and showed Russia’s military and administrative weaknesses, creating conditions for reform and for the reconfiguration of power in Italy and Germany.

## Italian nationalism and unification, 1815–1871
Italian unification (the Risorgimento) was not the product of a single movement but of overlapping political strands and personalities. In the wake of Napoleon, Italy was fragmented into multiple states, some under Austrian control. Early nationalists, like Mazzini, promoted a republican, popular nationalism; Cavour, the Piedmontese statesman, pursued a pragmatic liberal nationalism based on constitutional monarchy and diplomatic alliances; Garibaldi appealed to popular mobilisation and charismatic military action. Piedmont-Sardinia, under Cavour and King Victor Emmanuel II, became the engine of unification by combining diplomatic manoeuvre and selective warfare: alliance with France produced victories against Austria in 1859, while Garibaldi’s southern campaign in 1860 toppled the Bourbon kingdom of the Two Sicilies and pressed for unification under a monarchy. Rome and the Papal States remained the last obstacle; they were incorporated in 1870 after French troops were withdrawn in the Franco-Prussian War, and Rome became the capital in 1871. The Italian case shows how nationalism could be both liberal and conservative, how great-power politics shaped outcomes, and how different strands of nationalism (republican, dynastic, clerical) competed and sometimes cooperated.

## German nationalism and unification, 1815–1871
German unification follows a different path and highlights the importance of economic integration and power politics. After 1815, the German-speaking lands remained a patchwork of kingdoms, duchies and free cities within a loose Confederation dominated by Austria. Economic unification through the Zollverein (a customs union led by Prussia) fostered economic interdependence and strengthened Prussia’s leadership among the German states. Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian chancellor from 1862, pursued unification by “blood and iron”: he combined diplomatic isolation of rivals with limited wars to achieve political ends. War with Denmark (1864), victory over Austria in the Austro-Prussian War (1866), and the decisive defeat of France in 1870–71 united the northern German states under Prussian leadership and produced the proclamation of the German Empire at Versailles in 1871. The southern German states joined after the patriotic surge against France. Unification under Prussia created a powerful and conservative constitutional empire with the king of Prussia as emperor, and Bismarck’s policies then sought to stabilise and consolidate this new order through internal measures and social legislation.

## France, 1848–1871: revolution, empire and defeat
France between 1848 and 1871 illustrates the instability that accompanied the nineteenth century’s political experiments. The 1848 revolution overthrew the July Monarchy and produced the Second Republic. Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte was elected president and, in 1851, staged a coup to seize greater power; by 1852 he became Emperor Napoleon III and established the Second Empire. Napoleon III combined authoritarian rule with economic modernisation, support for railways and industrial expansion, and an active foreign policy. He also used plebiscites and popular politics to legitimise his regime, yet liberal concessions grew over time during the 1860s, producing a more parliamentary tone. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 exposed the limits of the Empire. The catastrophic defeat at Sedan led to the collapse of Napoleon III’s regime, the siege of Paris, and the proclamation of the Third Republic. The violent Paris Commune of 1871, though short-lived, emphasised the social tensions that accompanied political transition and underlined the volatile relationship between national unity and social questions in the making of modern France.

## Russia, 1825–1881: conservative autocracy and reform
Russia’s experience highlights a different pace of change. The Decembrist uprising of 1825 revealed elite dissatisfaction with the autocracy and the existence of liberal and constitutionalist ideas among officers, but Nicholas I’s reign responded with repression and a tightening of censorship, reinforcing autocratic structures. The Crimean War’s exposure of administrative and military backwardness convinced reformers that modernization was necessary. Alexander II (r.1855–1881) launched a series of major reforms intended to stabilise the regime by modernising society: the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 transformed rural labour relations and property law, zemstvos (local self-government) and judicial reforms created new institutions of local administration and legal fairness, and military reforms modernised conscription and command structures. These changes were significant but incomplete: emancipation left many peasants economically vulnerable, and zemstvos were limited in scope. The period also saw the rise of revolutionary movements, from moderate zemstvo liberals to radical populists and terrorists. The assassination of Alexander II in 1881 brought an end to the reforming impulse and ushered in renewed repression under his successor, but the legacies of the 1860s continued to shape Russia’s social and political development.

## Continuities, comparisons and historians’ debates
Students should be comfortable comparing different models of nationalism and state-building. Italian unification was shaped by liberal constitutionalism and popular mobilisation but finalised through conservative monarchy and diplomacy; German unification was driven by state power, military success and economic integration under Prussian leadership; both processes demonstrated that nationalism could be engineered from above as well as rising from popular sentiment. Historians debate the balance between structural forces (industrialisation, railways, economic change), the role of elites and leaders (Cavour, Bismarck, Napoleon III), and the importance of popular movements and ideology. Another recurring theme is the relationship between revolution and reform: revolutions often failed to secure immediate liberal outcomes but altered political cultures and made hoped-for reforms necessary; where reformers acted pragmatically (as in Russia under Alexander II), partial modernisation could stabilise regimes — at least temporarily. Understanding these continuities helps in developing comparative arguments and deeper causation chains in essays.

## Exam technique
When answering essay questions on revolution and nationalism, start with a concise thesis that directly addresses the question and outlines the argument. Use the introduction to set the chronological and conceptual frame: define your terms (for example, what you mean by “nationalism” or “revolution”), and indicate which factors you will weigh. Each main paragraph should open with a clear topic sentence and then integrate factual knowledge with analysis: explain how a fact supports your argument rather than merely listing events. Balance is important: where the question asks you to evaluate causes or importance, discuss rival explanations and weigh their relative impact. Use comparative material where relevant — contrasting Italian and German unification or comparing French and Russian responses to revolution strengthens answers by showing broader understanding. For source and interpretation work in depth units, assess provenance, purpose and limitations as you relate sources to the question. Time management matters: plan a structure, allocate time for introduction, development and conclusion, and leave a few minutes to refine your final judgement. Always end with a focused conclusion that summarises your findings and explains why your judgement follows from the evidence presented. Finally, aim for clear, precise writing: strong analysis and well-selected examples are more effective than long narrative.
