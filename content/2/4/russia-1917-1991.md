# Russia 1917–1991 (A-level History AQA)

## 1917: Revolution and the fall of the Tsar
The February Revolution of 1917 overthrew Nicholas II, ending three centuries of Romanov rule. Causes included military catastrophe in the First World War, food shortages, and the collapse of confidence in Tsarist government. The Provisional Government under Kerensky continued the war effort, fatally undermining its authority. The Petrograd Soviet's Order Number One weakened military discipline. Lenin returned from exile in April and issued the April Theses, demanding immediate peace, land redistribution, and Soviet power.

## The October Revolution and Bolshevik seizure of power
The October Revolution (Bolshevik coup of 25 October 1917 OS) was organised by Trotsky through the Military Revolutionary Committee. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918 after Socialist Revolutionaries won the most votes — a decisive step towards one-party rule. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918) with Germany secured peace at enormous territorial and economic cost but allowed Lenin to consolidate power domestically.

## Civil War and War Communism
The Civil War (1918–21) pitted the Red Army against a fragmented White opposition backed by foreign intervention. Trotsky built the Red Army into an effective force through centralisation and conscription. War Communism — grain requisitioning, nationalisation, and militarisation of labour — maintained the war effort but caused famine, collapse of industrial production, and deep popular resentment. The Kronstadt Rebellion (1921) demonstrated the regime's isolation even from groups that had supported it.

## Lenin's NEP and the succession struggle
The New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1921 partially restored market mechanisms, allowing peasants to sell surplus grain. It stabilised the economy and appeased the peasantry but was resented by orthodox Bolsheviks as ideological retreat. Lenin suffered strokes from 1922 and died in January 1924. His Testament warned against Stalin's concentration of power. The succession struggle among Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Trotsky, and Stalin saw Stalin use his control of party appointments (as General Secretary from 1922) to outmanoeuvre rivals. By 1929 Stalin had secured dominance.

## Stalinism: collectivisation and industrialisation
Stalin's revolution from above began with the forced collectivisation of agriculture from 1929. Kulaks were liquidated as a class; mass deportations and famine — including the Ukrainian Holodomor — killed millions. Rapid industrialisation through the Five Year Plans transformed the Soviet economy with dramatic growth in steel, coal, and electricity production, though often at catastrophic human cost and with persistent quality failures. The command economy subordinated consumption to heavy industry, defence, and prestige projects.

## The Terror and Stalinist political culture
The Great Terror of 1936–38 used show trials to eliminate Old Bolsheviks (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin) and purged the Red Army officer corps, diplomats, and intellectuals. The NKVD under Yezhov conducted mass operations: the kulak operation (Order 00447) and national operations targeted ethnic minorities. Estimates of those shot or sent to the Gulag range into the millions. Stalin's cult of personality, socialist realism in arts, and the subordination of all institutions to party control defined Stalinist political culture.

## The Great Patriotic War 1941–45
The Nazi invasion (Operation Barbarossa, June 1941) initially brought catastrophic Soviet defeats and the loss of vast territory. Stalin's purge of the officer corps had seriously weakened the Red Army. The battles of Moscow (1941), Stalingrad (1942–43), and Kursk (1943) marked the turning of the war. Soviet industrial relocation east and Lend-Lease aid were important factors in recovery. Victory in 1945 at enormous human cost (estimates of 27 million Soviet dead) reinforced Stalin's political authority and Soviet superpower status.

## Khrushchev and de-Stalinisation
Stalin died in March 1953. Khrushchev emerged as leader by 1956 and delivered the Secret Speech denouncing Stalin's cult of personality and crimes at the Twentieth Party Congress. De-Stalinisation involved releasing Gulag prisoners, rehabilitating some victims, and modest liberalisation (the Thaw). The Hungarian Uprising (1956) was crushed, revealing the limits of reform. The Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) ended in humiliation for Khrushchev. He was removed in a palace coup in 1964.

## Brezhnev: stagnation and the Soviet bloc
Brezhnev's era (1964–82) was characterised by political stability, nomenklatura privilege, and economic stagnation. The Brezhnev Doctrine asserted the USSR's right to intervene in socialist states, applied in Czechoslovakia in 1968 (Prague Spring). Détente with the West reduced tensions but the invasion of Afghanistan (1979) reignited Cold War hostility and overstretched Soviet resources.

## Gorbachev, collapse, and the end of the USSR
Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). Political liberalisation unleashed nationalist movements in the Soviet republics and exposed the regime's failures. The Eastern European revolutions of 1989 dismantled the Soviet bloc. The failed August coup of 1991, mounted by hardliners, accelerated the dissolution. The USSR formally ceased to exist on 25 December 1991 when Gorbachev resigned.

## Exam technique
Russia 1917–1991 questions frequently ask about the nature of Stalinist rule, the causes of Soviet collapse, and the extent to which leaders shaped events. Avoid narrative: structure arguments around analytical themes (ideology, economics, coercion, leadership). For factor-based questions, weigh relative significance with precise evidence. Reach a clear, justified judgment and acknowledge counter-arguments.
