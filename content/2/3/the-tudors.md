# The Tudors (A-level History AQA)

## Henry VII and the establishment of Tudor rule
Henry VII won the crown at Bosworth in 1485 ending the Wars of the Roses. He consolidated power by defeating Yorkist pretenders including Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck. Henry rebuilt royal finances through bonds, recognisances, and careful management of Crown lands. He used the Council Learned in the Law and the Court of Star Chamber to enforce royal authority and reduce baronial independence. By the time of his death in 1509 the dynasty was secure and the treasury solvent.

## Henry VIII: authority, reformation, and faction
Henry VIII inherited a strong position but his reign was defined by the pursuit of dynastic security, foreign prestige, and the break with Rome. Cardinal Wolsey dominated government until his fall in 1529 following failure to obtain the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Thomas Cromwell then engineered the Reformation Parliament and the Acts of Supremacy (1534), making Henry Supreme Head of the Church of England. The Dissolution of the Monasteries transferred enormous wealth to the Crown and redistributed land to the gentry. Henry's later reign was marked by factional instability around the succession and the influence of figures such as Thomas Cranmer and the Duke of Norfolk.

## Edward VI and the Protestant Reformation
Edward VI came to the throne in 1547 as a minor, with the Duke of Somerset acting as Lord Protector. Somerset pursued a more radical Protestant programme including the Book of Common Prayer (1549). The Kett's Rebellion and the Western Rising reflected social and religious discontent. Somerset was displaced by the Duke of Northumberland, whose more controlled Protestantism produced the 1552 Prayer Book and the Forty-Two Articles. Northumberland's attempt to alter the succession in favour of Lady Jane Grey collapsed on Mary's accession in 1553.

## Mary I: Catholic restoration and its limits
Mary I restored papal authority and Catholic doctrine, reversing the Edwardian changes. Her marriage to Philip II of Spain alarmed Protestant opinion and contributed to anxiety about foreign domination. Nearly 300 Protestants were burned between 1555 and 1558, earning her the epithet Bloody Mary among her opponents. The loss of Calais in 1558 damaged English prestige. Mary's inability to produce an heir meant the restoration was reversed on Elizabeth's accession.

## Elizabeth I: settlement, stability, and succession
Elizabeth's Religious Settlement of 1559 sought a via media — the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity restored royal headship and a Protestant liturgy while avoiding the extremes of Edwardian radicalism. The threat from Mary Queen of Scots, the Northern Earls' Rebellion (1569), and the Ridolfi and Babington Plots tested regime security. Walsingham's intelligence network was central to these defeats. The excommunication of Elizabeth by Pius V in 1570 hardened the association between Catholicism and treason. Elizabeth's management of Parliament, her uso of patronage, and her cultivation of the cult of Gloriana sustained royal authority through difficult decades.

## Late Elizabethan problems and the Essex revolt
The 1590s brought economic hardship (harvest failures, inflation) and political strain from the Irish rebellion under Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. The Earl of Essex's failed revolt in 1601 revealed the fragility of the factional consensus Elizabeth had maintained. Robert Cecil manoeuvred to secure the Stuart succession, and Elizabeth died in 1603 without naming an heir publicly.

## Government, Parliament, and faction
Tudor government rested on conciliar administration, royal patronage, and the selective use of Parliament. Parliament was not a continuous body but met at the Crown's pleasure; its importance grew through the Reformation as legislation was needed to legitimise religious change. Faction at court — competing noble and gentry networks seeking access to the monarch — was a constant feature of Tudor politics, becoming particularly dangerous during royal minorities and periods of succession anxiety.

## Exam technique
A-level essays require a sustained, analytical argument across the full time period. Compare factors and consider change over time rather than narrating events. Use precise historical vocabulary, integrate named examples as evidence rather than lists, and reach a clear judgement. For Tudor topics, questions often pit the role of individuals against structural, religious, economic, or political factors — always address both sides and reach a reasoned conclusion.
