# Families and Households (A-level Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview and core themes
The Families and Households topic explores how family life is organised, how it has changed over time, and how families both reflect and reproduce wider social structures. At A-level you are expected to consider families in relation to the two core themes of the specification: socialisation, culture and identity; and social differentiation, power and stratification. This means analysing how families contribute to primary socialisation and identity formation, while also examining inequalities within and between families — for example by class, gender, ethnicity, age and generation. You should place contemporary UK family life in historical and global context, recognising the role of economic forces, state policies and global processes in shaping family patterns.

## Family forms, family life and demographic change
Understanding contemporary families begins with recognising the variety of family and household structures that exist today. Traditional nuclear families persist alongside lone-parent households, cohabiting couples, same-sex partnerships, stepfamilies and living-apart-together relationships. Household arrangements also include single-person households, multigenerational households and complex transnational families formed through migration. Over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries there have been clear demographic trends: fertility rates fell from the high levels of the early twentieth century to lower and more variable rates in recent decades; mortality rates declined and life expectancy increased; marriage rates fell while cohabitation and later marriage rose; divorce rates increased from the 1960s onward and then stabilised; and net migration has contributed to changing population size and ethnic composition. These trends have implications for family size, the life course, dependency ratios and public policy.

## Theories of the family
Sociological perspectives offer contrasting explanations for the role and nature of the family. Functionalist approaches emphasise the family’s role in socialising the next generation and stabilising adult personalities, focusing on the functions the family performs for society. In contrast, Marxist perspectives see the family as serving capitalist interests, reproducing labour power and perpetuating class inequality through inheritance and socialisation. Feminist theories highlight gender inequality within families; radical feminists argue that the family is a key institution in maintaining patriarchal power, while other feminist strands emphasise both cultural and material causes of unequal domestic divisions. The New Right perspective treats the family as a private sphere under threat from social change and often advocates policies that support the traditional nuclear family. More contemporary theories such as the individualisation thesis and postmodernist approaches emphasise choice, diversity and the decline of fixed family structures, while the personal life perspective encourages attention to meanings and relationships that people themselves prioritise rather than imposing structural categories. A-level answers should show awareness of these competing viewpoints, apply them to concrete family patterns, and assess their strengths and weaknesses.

## Gender roles, domestic labour and power relations
A central strand of the specification is the study of gender roles and the distribution of domestic labour and power within families. Since the mid-twentieth century women’s participation in paid work has increased dramatically, yet unpaid domestic labour and care work often remain unequally shared. Explanations for this inequality vary: cultural explanations point to gendered socialisation and persistent gender norms; material explanations emphasise economic factors such as differences in earnings, hours worked and the availability and cost of childcare. Sociologists have also explored the emotional and mental labour involved in running households, sometimes described as the “triple shift” of paid work, domestic tasks and emotional management. Power in the household can be analysed through decision-making patterns, control of resources and experiences of violence and coercion. Empirical research often uses household surveys, time-use studies and qualitative interviews to reveal patterns and lived experiences; when using evidence in essays, consider whether statistics capture private power dynamics and what qualitative research adds.

## Childhood, parenting and the sociology of personal life
The study of childhood examines how children’s status has changed over time and how childhood itself is socially constructed. Historically, children were often economic contributors to households; modern childhood in the UK is characterised by legal protections, compulsory schooling, and an emphasis on child welfare and development. The “new sociology of childhood” views children as active social agents with their own perspectives, while also recognising inequalities between children shaped by class, ethnicity, disability and gender. Parenting practices and family relationships have diversified: parenting ideals such as intensive parenting and notions of risk shape family behaviour. The personal life perspective extends analysis beyond conventional roles to include chosen kin, friends, pets and donor-conceived relationships; this helps explain how individuals construct family meanings in diverse ways that official definitions may overlook.

## State policy, the economy and globalisation
The relationship between families and the state is central to understanding family change. State policies — including welfare provision, tax and benefit systems, maternity and paternity leave, childcare support and housing policy — shape family decisions about marriage, childbearing and work. Policies can encourage certain family forms, for instance through tax incentives or housing schemes, or can mitigate inequalities, for example by providing child benefit or subsidised childcare. Economic changes such as deindustrialisation, the rise of flexible employment, wage stagnation and the expansion of the service economy influence family life by altering job security, working hours and gender divisions of labour. Globalisation also matters: migration creates transnational families and diversifies family practices; global markets and media reshape cultural norms around parenting and partner choice; and global care chains mean that care responsibilities are often outsourced across borders. When evaluating policy effects, consider both intended consequences and unintended outcomes for different social groups.

## Family diversity and social differentiation
Family patterns vary significantly by class, ethnicity, religion and geography, producing differentiated experiences and life chances. For example, patterns of marriage, cohabitation and childbearing differ by social class and ethnic group; economic inequality affects housing options and the capacity to combine work and family life; and rural and urban contexts offer differing access to support networks and services. The concept of family diversity challenges any single “normative” family type and requires sociologists to explain why different family forms exist and persist. Explanations range from structural forces like economic constraints and labour market demands to cultural explanations emphasizing values, religion or community norms. When analysing diversity, be careful to avoid deterministic conclusions: individual agency, negotiation within families and adaptive strategies often mediate structural pressures.

## Research methods and measuring family life
Research on families uses a wide range of methods, each with advantages and limitations. Quantitative methods such as official statistics, large-scale surveys and longitudinal studies are valuable for identifying trends in marriage, fertility, divorce and household composition and for enabling comparisons over time and between groups. Qualitative methods — including in-depth interviews, participant observation and case studies — illuminate meanings, interactions and power relations inside families that numbers alone cannot reveal. Mixed-methods approaches combine breadth and depth. When applying methods in context, pay attention to issues of reliability, validity, representativeness and ethical concerns such as informed consent, privacy and the sensitivity of topics like domestic violence. Consider also how terms are defined and measured: for example, “household” and “family” can be counted differently in surveys, which affects the interpretation of trends.

## Exam technique
To do well in Families and Households essays, begin by planning a clear structure: define the key terms in the question, outline a brief plan of your argument, and ensure each paragraph develops a point linked to the question. For AO1 demonstrate precise knowledge of concepts, theories and relevant empirical evidence; name perspectives and key ideas when appropriate. For AO2 apply sociological theory and data to the specifics of the question — for example, use demographic trends, policy examples or case study findings to illustrate points. For AO3 offer evaluation and analysis: weigh up competing explanations, assess the quality of evidence, consider methodological limitations and discuss contemporary relevance. In practice, a strong 20 to 30 mark essay will have an introduction that defines terms and states an argument, several developed paragraphs that alternate explanation and evaluation, and a concise conclusion that draws the argument together.

When answering methods-in-context questions, explicitly link methodological strengths and weaknesses to studying families; explain how a particular method would handle access, ethics and sensitive topics, and whether it would capture private processes such as power dynamics. Use up-to-date and varied examples — for instance, refer to changing leave policies, rising life expectancy, or the growth of cohabitation — and show awareness of social differentiation by discussing how effects vary by class, gender or ethnicity. Time management matters: allocate time proportionally to the marks available, spend a few minutes planning, and leave time to proofread. Finally, practice writing under timed conditions, revise key sociological theories and studies so you can deploy them confidently, and when in doubt, link back to the core themes of socialisation, culture and identity and social differentiation, power and stratification to demonstrate breadth of understanding.
