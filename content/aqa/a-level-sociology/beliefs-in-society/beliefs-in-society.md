# Beliefs in Society (A-level Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What this topic covers and why it matters
Beliefs in Society explores the place of religion and other belief systems in contemporary social life. It asks how religion helps to shape identity, social relationships and institutions, and how it interacts with processes such as modernisation, globalisation and social change. Students study both religious and non‑religious worldviews, including Christian and non‑Christian traditions, New Age movements and the growing category of people who describe themselves as spiritual but not religious. The focus is primarily on UK society, but comparative and global dimensions are central: for example, why secularisation appears more advanced in some European countries but not in others, and how religions spread and transform across borders. Understanding this topic helps explain major social debates about multiculturalism, political mobilization, gender and sexuality, social cohesion and conflict.

## Key concepts and core themes
At the heart of the topic are concepts such as belief, religiosity, secularisation, fundamentalism, spiritual pluralism and religious organisation. Religiosity can be unpacked into dimensions of belief (what people accept as true), practice (rituals, worship and prayer), and belonging (membership, identity and affiliation). Secularisation is used in different senses: the decline of religious belief and practice among individuals, the marginalisation of religion in public life and institutions, and the differentiation of religious and secular spheres. The core sociological themes of socialisation, culture and identity, and social differentiation, power and stratification apply throughout. Religion is simultaneously a source of identity and a field in which power struggles over values, norms and resources play out, so students should be able to show how religion is both socially constructed and socially consequential.

## Theoretical approaches to religion
Classical and contemporary sociological perspectives offer competing explanations for religion’s functions and effects. Functionalist approaches emphasise social integration, collective conscience and the role of rituals in creating social solidarity; religion is seen as performing positive, stabilising functions for society. Marxist perspectives emphasise religion as part of the ideological superstructure that can legitimate inequality and divert attention from economic exploitation, while also acknowledging religion’s potential for protest and liberation in some contexts. Weberian analysis explores the cultural and economic links between particular religious ideas and social change, most famously the ways certain Protestant beliefs influenced the development of capitalism. Feminist critiques expose how many religions reflect and reinforce patriarchal power, shaping gender roles and the social organisation of the family. Postmodern and contemporary theorists draw attention to the plural, consumerised and fragmented religious landscape in late modern societies: individuals may pick and mix beliefs in a spiritual marketplace, and religious authority can be decentralised. Each approach has strengths and limitations; effective answers show how theory illuminates specific empirical patterns and also where it may be incomplete.

## Religious organisations, types and new movements
Sociology distinguishes between different kinds of religious organisations and movements because they relate differently to society and to their members. Traditional churches and established denominations tend to have formal hierarchies, institutional ties to the state and broad social membership. Sects are typically more exclusive, demanding higher levels of commitment and often forming in opposition to mainstream religion or society. Cults and New Religious Movements are more fluid, centred on charismatic leadership or novel spiritual practices, and often attract those seeking meaning outside traditional institutions. New Age spirituality and the wider category of ‘spiritual but not religious’ reflect trends towards individualised belief and self‑development practices such as meditation and holistic healing. These distinctions help explain differences in recruitment, social impact and the kinds of social control or support such organisations provide.

## Religion, social change and secularisation debates
One of the most contested areas in the study of religion is whether societies are becoming uniformly secular. Classic secularisation theory predicts a long‑term decline in religious belief and institutional power as societies modernise and rationalise. Empirical patterns are mixed: church attendance in many Western European countries has fallen, but religion remains robust in other settings, including parts of the United States and many areas of the Global South where religious affiliation and practice remain high or are growing. Processes such as globalisation and migration have reshaped religious landscapes: movement of people brings new faiths and revitalises old ones, while transnational religious organisations link communities across borders. At the same time, religious revival and fundamentalism can emerge as reactions to rapid social change, providing certainty and identity in uncertain times. A balanced answer recognises that secularisation is not a single uniform process and considers cultural, political and economic factors that produce different outcomes in different places.

## Religion and social groups: class, gender, ethnicity and age
Religion is intertwined with patterns of social differentiation. Class influences patterns of belief and practice, for example in the types of religious organisations people join and the forms of religiosity they express. Gender remains crucial: many faith traditions have gendered roles and doctrines, and women and men often experience religion differently, both as leaders and as participants. Ethnicity and religion are frequently linked, especially among migrant communities where religious institutions provide social networks, cultural continuity and support in host societies. Age patterns matter too: younger cohorts in some societies show lower levels of traditional religious participation, but they may express spirituality through different practices or new movements. Understanding these intersections helps explain why religion can both reproduce social divisions and provide resources for social cohesion or collective action among marginalised groups.

## Methods, measurement and theoretical-method debates
Studying religion requires careful methodological choices. Quantitative approaches such as surveys and official statistics are useful for measuring patterns of affiliation, attendance and belief across large populations, but they can miss depth and meaning. Qualitative methods, including interviews, participant observation and life histories, reveal how individuals interpret belief, ritual and identity, and how religious practices are embedded in everyday life. Students must understand practical and ethical issues: defining what counts as ‘religion’, gaining access to religious communities, and protecting sensitive information. The relationship between theory and methods is also important: positivist approaches favour quantifiable indicators and generalisable patterns, while interpretivist perspectives prioritise understanding subjective meanings. Debates about value freedom and the possibility of objectivity are relevant when sociologists study religion, which often involves deeply held convictions.

## Teaching and applying this content: practical examples
Illustrative examples help make abstract ideas concrete. In the UK context, discussions might use the decline in Church of England attendance alongside the growth of Pentecostal congregations within African and Caribbean communities to show pluralisation rather than simple decline. The role of mosques and faith schools in diasporic Muslim communities can illustrate how religion supports identity and social capital. New Age practices such as mindfulness and yoga, increasingly visible in secular settings, demonstrate how spiritual practices can be mainstreamed and commodified. Global examples, such as the rapid growth of evangelical movements in parts of Africa and Latin America, show how religion can be a dynamic force in development and politics. Teachers should encourage students to link such empirical evidence to theory, showing, for example, how Weberian, Marxist or postmodern perspectives help explain different aspects of these cases.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Beliefs in Society, start by carefully defining key terms and setting out the focus of your response. For short answer questions, aim for precise, targeted explanations that show relevant knowledge. For extended essays, structure your response with a clear introduction that outlines the argument, followed by paragraphs that integrate theory, empirical evidence and analysis. Each paragraph should introduce a point, explain it, apply it to evidence or an example, and then evaluate or link back to the question. Balance is essential: address competing theoretical perspectives and weigh their strengths and weaknesses. Use specific, contemporary examples drawn from UK and global contexts to illustrate points and demonstrate application. In evaluation, consider methodological limitations of the evidence you use and discuss wider implications, such as how social change or policy might alter the patterns you describe. Practise timing to ensure full development of argument, and in unseen questions take a few minutes to plan, noting the points you will make and the examples you will use so your answer remains coherent and directly relevant to the assessment objectives of knowledge, application and evaluation.
