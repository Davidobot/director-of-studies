# Crime and Deviance (A-level Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview and why it matters
Crime and deviance is a core A-level topic that asks fundamental sociological questions about what counts as wrongdoing, who defines it, why people offend, and how societies respond. Studying this topic develops analytical skills by linking theory to real-world evidence and by requiring engagement with methods of social research. The emphasis in the AQA specification is on contemporary UK society, but explanations and examples should be situated within broader comparative and global contexts where relevant. Students are expected to move beyond description: you must explain patterns of offending and victimisation, evaluate competing theories, and apply research methods to crime-related questions. The topic is necessarily interdisciplinary, drawing on sociology, politics, criminology and social policy, and its debates have clear implications for issues such as policing, welfare, human rights and social inequality.

## Key concepts and definitions
A clear grasp of central concepts is essential. Crime refers to behaviour that breaches formal legal codes; deviance is a broader term covering actions that violate social norms and attract negative social reaction whether or not they are illegal. Social control describes the mechanisms—formal and informal—by which societies regulate behaviour and maintain order. The relationship between social order and social control invites analysis of consensus explanations, which see shared values as the glue of society, and conflict explanations, which view laws and sanctions as reflecting power relations and interests. Related concepts you should use confidently include socialisation, stigma, labelling, subculture, strain, anomie, moral panic, white-collar and corporate crime, state crime, the dark figure of crime, and surveillance. Always define terms briefly in answers and then use them analytically to answer the question set.

## Major sociological theories of crime and deviance
Sociological perspectives offer contrasting explanations of why crime occurs. Functionalist approaches, drawing on Durkheim and later Merton, suggest that crime can be a product of strain between culturally prescribed goals and the socially structured means to achieve them; where legitimate opportunities are blocked, some individuals innovate and turn to crime. Subcultural theories extend this by arguing that groups may develop alternative values that celebrate delinquent behaviour as a response to blocked opportunity or status frustration, as in Cohen’s account of working-class youth.

Marxist and neo-Marxist perspectives place class, capitalism and power at the centre. From a Marxist view, laws reflect the interests of the ruling class; corporate and state crimes are explained as systemic outcomes of capitalist competition and the profit motive. Neo-Marxists such as Taylor, Walton and Young add that deviance should be understood through a synthesis of structure, culture and agency, and they emphasise how definitions of crime are socially constructed.

Interactionist and labelling theories shift focus from causes of offending to processes of social reaction. Becker argues that deviance is produced when groups label behaviour as wrongdoing; the labelled person may internalise a deviant identity and continue offending. Control theories, by contrast, ask why most people conform, pointing to bonds of attachment, commitment and involvement that inhibit deviant behaviour. Left and right realist perspectives emerged in response to perceived limitations in earlier accounts: left realists highlight the material and relative deprivation that produces crime and the need for practical solutions, while right realists emphasise individual responsibility, biological tendencies, and the importance of tough policing and social control.

Feminist theories interrogate gendered patterns of offending, victimisation and criminal justice responses. They point to patriarchy, gendered power relations and the marginalisation of female experiences in mainstream criminology. Finally, postmodern and late-modern perspectives highlight fluid identities, the symbolic nature of crime and the expanding scope of surveillance and risk management in contemporary societies. Familiarity with these perspectives allows comparison and critical evaluation in essays and shorter answers.

## Social distribution, patterns and types of crime
A-level work requires you to explain how crime is distributed across social groups and why patterns change over time. Social class remains a powerful predictor of many kinds of crime. Working-class neighbourhoods often experience higher levels of recorded street crime and violence, although middle-class white-collar and corporate crimes can be hidden or under-prosecuted. Gender differences are stark: men are more likely to be arrested for and convicted of most offences, especially violent crime, while women’s offending profiles often differ and are influenced by pathways involving victimisation, caregiving or survival strategies. Ethnicity is central to debates about over-representation in criminal justice statistics; differential policing, socioeconomic inequality and institutional racism are all factors to be considered alongside patterns of offending.

Contemporary A-level content also asks you to be familiar with newer or less traditional categories of criminality. Green crime, which includes environmental harms committed by individuals, corporations and states, challenges legal and moral boundaries and highlights global harm. State crime and human rights violations raise questions about legality, legitimacy and power: acts legalised by the state may be judged immoral or criminal by other standards. Transnational and cybercrime have grown with globalisation and new technologies, requiring students to think beyond national borders and conventional policing. When discussing patterns, always consider the limitations of official statistics, the role of victim surveys and self-report studies in revealing the ‘dark figure’ of unreported offending, and the changing landscape of crimes that are recognised and prioritised by policy-makers.

## Crime control, punishment and surveillance
Understanding how societies respond to crime is as important as understanding its causes. The criminal justice system comprises police, courts, prisons and probation, and its practices reflect theories about punishment and control. Retributive, deterrent and rehabilitative rationales shape sentencing policy, and debates over effectiveness and fairness are perennial. Sentencing trends, overcrowding, alternatives to custody such as restorative justice, and the politicisation of punishment are useful examples to discuss.

Surveillance, both physical and digital, is now a major mechanism of social control. CCTV, biometrics, data profiling and predictive policing raise questions about privacy, inequality and the potential for discriminatory practice. Theoretical frameworks, such as Foucault’s analysis of disciplinary power, help explain the expansion of surveillance and its social consequences. Preventive strategies—situational crime prevention, community policing, social programmes to address underlying causes—should be assessed in terms of their efficacy, unintended consequences and ethical implications. In evaluations, draw on empirical evidence and discuss how measures affect different social groups unequally.

## Research methods in the study of crime and deviance
AQA emphasises the relationship between theory and methods, and in Crime and Deviance you must be able to apply research methods to crime-related topics. Official statistics, such as police recorded crime figures and the Crime Survey for England and Wales, are readily available and useful for identifying trends, but they are shaped by reporting practices, recording rules and police activity. Victim surveys and self-report studies can reveal hidden offending and provide insights into patterns not captured by official data; however, they are susceptible to recall bias and sampling limitations. Qualitative methods—participant observation, in-depth interviews, life histories and documentary analysis—offer rich insights into offenders’ and victims’ experiences, the meaning of deviance and laboratory-like detail about processes such as labelling, desistance and criminal careers.

When evaluating methods in context, discuss the practical and ethical challenges of researching criminal populations, including access, safety, informed consent and the risk of causing harm. Consider how methodological choices reflect theoretical commitments: positivist approaches favour quantitative, generalisable data about social facts, while interpretivist approaches prioritise subjective meanings and social action. Be prepared to assess mixed-methods designs and to explain how research can inform policy, for instance through evaluation studies of interventions and their measurable outcomes. Named studies, classic methodological critiques and examples of method-policy links strengthen answers.

## Globalisation, media and contemporary developments
Globalisation has transformed both the nature of crime and the mechanisms for controlling it. Transnational organised crime, human trafficking, drug smuggling, cyber-enabled fraud and global financial crimes illustrate how boundaries have shifted. International institutions, treaties and cooperation between police forces are increasingly central to responses, yet enforcement remains uneven and influenced by political and economic priorities. The media shapes public perceptions of crime, often amplifying moral panics and influencing policy agendas. News coverage can exaggerate certain offences and social groups, producing fear that may not align with empirical risk. Analysing media representations requires attention to selection, framing and audience effects, and how moral entrepreneurs, politicians and interest groups interact to construct social problems. Contemporary developments such as the rise of digital surveillance, debates about decriminalisation or tougher sentencing, and public campaigns on topics like knife crime or online abuse provide rich material for applied analysis and evaluation.

## Exam technique
Understanding the exam’s structure and assessment objectives is vital to success. Paper 3 is a two-hour paper worth 80 marks, split between a 50-mark section on Crime and Deviance (short and extended answers) and a 30-mark section on Theory and Methods (extended writing). The assessment objectives are AO1 (knowledge and understanding), AO2 (application), and AO3 (analysis and evaluation). Your answers must demonstrate all three where required: show accurate sociological knowledge, apply it to the question or given material, and evaluate using evidence, theory and methodological critique.

For the 50-mark section allocate your time so you can plan, write and revise; a useful guide is roughly 75 minutes for the 50-mark portion and 45 minutes for the 30-mark portion. Begin essays with a concise definition and a clear plan that addresses the question directly. Use relevant theories to explain patterns and use up-to-date, concrete examples to apply the theory; named sociologists and studies should be deployed accurately but not mechanically. For evaluation, consider limitations of explanations, counter-evidence, alternative theories and methodological issues. In shorter answer questions be precise: a clear definition, one or two sentences of analysis and a brief evaluative comment often suffices.

For the 30-mark Theory and Methods question be prepared to integrate debates about positivism and interpretivism, the relationship between theory and methods, and issues of reliability, validity, representativeness, ethics and practicalities. Show how methods can be applied in context (methods in context) and how theories influence methodological choice. To achieve high AO3 marks, reach a judgement: do not simply list strengths and weaknesses, but weigh evidence and indicate which explanations or methods you find most convincing and why.

Practice planning essays under timed conditions, annotate past paper questions with which theories and methods are most relevant, and learn a compact bank of well-understood, adaptable examples such as police recording practices, victim surveys, corporate scandals, state abuses, and surveillance technologies. Use sociological vocabulary correctly and explicitly tie examples back to the question. In the final minutes check that your argument is coherent, that you have answered the question asked, and that key terms are defined. With theory, evidence and method woven together, your answers will demonstrate the analytical depth AQA requires.
