# Stratification and Differentiation (A-level Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: what this topic covers and why it matters
Stratification and differentiation is a central topic in A-level Sociology because it asks the most fundamental sociological question: how and why do people occupy different positions in society, and what are the consequences of those differences? At its heart this topic examines patterns of inequality across the life course and across groups, the structures and processes that create and maintain those inequalities, and the ways individuals and institutions respond to them. Studying stratification helps you understand issues from access to education and healthcare to patterns of voting, crime, work and consumption. For students aiming to develop sociological thinking, this topic trains you to link theory, evidence and methods: you are expected not only to describe patterns of inequality, but to explain, analyse and evaluate competing sociological accounts and to apply research methods to investigate them.

## Core concepts and themes
Two core themes run through the study of stratification and differentiation and should be used as organising threads in answers: socialisation, culture and identity; and social differentiation, power and stratification. Key concepts you must master include social class, status, power, life chances, inequality, social mobility, and differentiation by gender, ethnicity and age. Class can be understood in different ways: as an economic position based on relations to the means of production in a Marxist sense, as an occupation-based hierarchy in Weberian and contemporary approaches, and as a combination of economic, cultural and social capital in Bourdieu’s analysis. Status describes prestige and lifestyle differences; power refers to the ability of groups to secure their interests and shape institutions. Life chances capture how these structural differences affect individuals’ opportunities over time. Always aim to link definitions to examples and to the two core themes: for example, how family socialisation shapes identity and affects later classed life chances; or how institutional power reproduces inequality through education and the labour market.

## Forms and patterns of stratification: class, gender, ethnicity and age
Stratification is multi-dimensional and typically studied across four main axes: social class, gender, ethnicity and age. Class stratification in the UK is often discussed in terms of occupational class schemes, patterns of income and wealth distribution, and inequalities in life chances such as educational attainment and health. Gender stratification includes patterns such as occupational segregation, the gender pay gap, and differences in unpaid domestic labour and power within households. Ethnic inequalities show themselves in labour market outcomes, criminal justice interactions, health and educational attainment, often intersecting with class and locality. Age stratification examines how resources, status and social roles differ between life stages, for instance the differing experiences of young people entering a precarious labour market compared with older workers facing redundancy or retirement. In all these areas, you should be able to describe typical patterns, explain how they are produced, and assess their social consequences. Use concrete UK-based examples where possible: changes in industrial employment affecting working-class communities, disparities in educational outcomes between different ethnic groups, or the growing economic insecurity of some younger cohorts.

## Theoretical explanations of stratification
Sociological theories offer competing and complementary explanations of why stratification exists and how it operates. Functionalist accounts argue that stratification performs necessary social functions: it provides incentives for talented individuals and allocates roles to maintain social order. Marxist and neo-Marxist perspectives focus on economic structures and class conflict, seeing stratification as rooted in exploitation and the interests of capital, with ruling class power exercised through institutions and ideology. Weber broadened the analysis beyond economic class to include status groups and political power, arguing that class, status and party jointly shape life chances. Feminist theories centre gendered power relations, emphasising how patriarchy intersects with class and other inequalities. Bourdieu’s approach highlights cultural and social capital as mechanisms of class reproduction through education and tastes. Postmodern and contemporary writers point to fragmentation, the growth of precarious labour and cultural diversity, suggesting that inequalities are becoming more complex rather than simply diminishing. Effective answers will set these theories in dialogue: you should use them to explain particular empirical patterns, compare their strengths and weaknesses, and consider how they might be combined to provide fuller explanations.

## Problems of definition and measurement
One of the most demanding aspects of this topic is understanding how difficult it is to define and measure social class and other inequalities. Occupational classifications capture important differences but miss wealth, consumption patterns and cultural capital. Income measures are sensitive to short-term fluctuations and tax regimes; wealth is more unequal than income and harder to measure reliably. Subjective class identity—how people see themselves—can diverge from objective measures. Cultural factors, such as tastes and educational credentials, complicate any single measure of class. Ethnicity and gender present similar measurement challenges: categories change over time and may reflect a mix of cultural, legal and self-identified elements. As a student you should be able to discuss different operational definitions, explain their limitations, and show how methodological choices shape findings. For example, using occupation-based measures might understate the social position of those with high wealth but no current occupation, while survey measures may miss the informal economy where some groups work.

## Globalisation and changes in structures of inequality
Stratification is not static; globalisation has reshaped the structure and scales of inequality. Deindustrialisation and the expansion of service and knowledge-based sectors have altered the occupational structure, producing new forms of precarity and widening regional inequalities. At a global level, theorists such as Sklair have identified a transnational capitalist class whose economic power spans national borders, influencing policy and contributing to global patterns of wealth concentration. Global flows of finance, goods, people and culture have created winners and losers within nations as well as between them, with multinational corporations and international institutions shaping labour markets, welfare policies and cultural norms. These shifts have implications for social policy and for patterns of mobility: while some individuals gain new opportunities through globalised industries and markets, others face declining prospects in formerly secure sectors. In the classroom, explore examples such as the hollowing out of manufacturing towns, the rise of platform work, and the differential impacts of trade and migration on local labour markets.

## Social mobility, consequences and policy responses
Social mobility—both intergenerational and intragenerational—is a key measure of how open a society is. Patterns of mobility depend on the strength of class structures, the distribution of education and cultural capital, labour market flexibility, and welfare provision. Debates focus on whether mobility is declining, which groups are most affected, and whether mobility alone is a sufficient measure of justice when absolute inequalities in wealth and life chances remain large. The consequences of stratification include unequal access to healthcare and education, strengthened social segregation, and political disaffection that can undermine social cohesion. Policy responses range from progressive taxation and welfare provision to targeted educational policies, anti-discrimination laws and active labour market programmes. Critical evaluation of policy requires linking policy aims to theoretical assumptions: does increasing access to higher education reduce class inequalities, or does it primarily redistribute credentials in ways that reproduce advantage? Consider also unintended consequences, such as market-based reforms that can widen inequalities even while expanding choice.

## Research methods and classroom investigation
Understanding stratification requires appropriate methods. Official statistics, large-scale surveys and longitudinal cohort studies are invaluable for tracking patterns over time and comparing groups. Qualitative methods—interviews, ethnography and participant observation—reveal lived experiences of inequality, how identities are shaped by class and how people negotiate structures of domination. Mixed-methods approaches allow you to triangulate broad patterns with in-depth accounts. In the A-level course you are expected to be able to apply research methods to stratification topics: design small-scale investigations, choose suitable methods, and assess practical and ethical issues. For teaching, set tasks that combine secondary data analysis with qualitative interviews or focus groups, enabling students to see how measurement choices affect conclusions. Discuss ethical challenges such as researching vulnerable groups, ensuring confidentiality, and avoiding harm when studying sensitive issues like poverty or discrimination.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on stratification and differentiation, begin by carefully interpreting the question and identifying which part of the topic it targets. For short-answer questions, be concise: define key terms clearly and give a focused example. For extended essays, structure your response with an introduction that defines the issue and outlines the argument, clear analytical paragraphs that integrate sociological theory with empirical evidence, and a conclusion that evaluates arguments and reaches a reasoned judgement. Use theory to explain patterns and evidence to support claims, but always include evaluation: question assumptions, consider counterarguments, and comment on measurement or methodological limitations. Draw links across the core themes of socialisation, culture and identity and social differentiation, power and stratification, and where relevant show awareness of contemporary and global contexts. In practice, aim to include at least two or three theoretical perspectives in essays, support these with specific, contemporary examples, and end with a balanced judgement that directly answers the question. Practising past papers, organising evidence into ready-made case studies, and refining timing will transform knowledge into exam performance.
