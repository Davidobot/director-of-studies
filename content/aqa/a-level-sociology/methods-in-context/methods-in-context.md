# Methods in Context (research methods) (A-level Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction
Methods in Context asks you to do more than name research methods: it asks you to apply methods to real sociological problems, judge their appropriateness and limitations, and show awareness of the theoretical and ethical issues that shape research. This section of the AQA specification centres on applying quantitative and qualitative tools to topics such as education, families, health and crime, with a particular emphasis on contemporary UK society. As you revise, think of Methods in Context as a practical exercise in designing and evaluating research that connects theory, method and the lived social world.

## Core concepts and important distinctions
To succeed you must be clear about a number of key distinctions. Primary data are data you collect yourself; secondary data are those produced by others, such as official statistics or historical documents. Quantitative data are numerical and suited to measuring patterns and making comparisons; qualitative data are descriptive and suited to exploring meanings, processes and identities. Positivism favours objective measurement and quantitative methods, while interpretivism emphasises subjective meanings and prefers qualitative methods. Validity is about whether a study truly measures what it claims to measure; reliability is about whether results could be reproduced; representativeness concerns how well a sample reflects a wider population; generalisability deals with whether findings can be applied more broadly. Understanding these ideas will help you pick and justify methods and evaluate the quality of research.

## Common research methods and how they are used in context
Questionnaires are widely used when you need standardised, often quantitative, information from many people. In an education context a questionnaire could measure attitudes to homework across several schools, producing data that can be compared by social class, gender or ethnicity. Structured and closed questions boost comparability but lose nuance. Interviews range from highly structured to unstructured. Structured interviews are useful when you want reliable responses across many respondents; unstructured interviews are better when exploring pupils’ identities or family dynamics. Participant observation allows the researcher to witness interactions and routines, for example by spending time in a classroom or youth club. This method yields rich, valid data about behaviour and meanings but is time-consuming and raises issues of role and access. Non-participant observation can be less intrusive but may miss insider perspectives. Experiments are rare in sociology but quasi-experimental designs are sometimes used to evaluate educational interventions, such as the impact of a new teaching method on attainment, comparing similar schools that do and do not implement the change. Official statistics and documents are vital secondary sources: school league tables, Ofsted reports, policy papers and historical records provide contextual and longitudinal evidence that can be combined with primary research. Content analysis is a systematic way to study documents or media representations, such as how the press portrays youth crime or mental illness.

## Research design, sampling and practicalities
A clear research design links your research question to the methods and to sampling. Sampling choices determine whether your study can claim representativeness. Random sampling and stratified sampling are useful when you want to generalise to a larger population; purposive or snowball sampling helps when studying hard-to-reach groups such as gang-involved youth or recent migrant families. Pilot studies are essential to test questionnaires and interview schedules for clarity and validity. Longitudinal designs track changes over time and are especially valuable for studying life course issues in families or educational trajectories, while cross-sectional designs give a snapshot useful for comparing groups at one point in time. Case studies focus intensively on a single setting, such as one school, and can illuminate processes and contradictions, though they often limit the scope for generalisation. Always consider resources: time, funding and researcher skills will shape which designs are realistic.

## Practical, ethical and theoretical considerations
Practical constraints often shape what is possible. Gaining access to schools requires negotiation with gatekeepers and compliance with safeguarding rules; observational work in classrooms requires parental consent and sensitivity to confidentiality. Ethics are not an optional add-on: informed consent, protection from harm, anonymity and the right to withdraw must guide any study, and ethical dilemmas often arise when covert methods or vulnerable participants are involved. Theoretically, your choice of method should reflect the research aims and your epistemological stance. Interpretivists will criticise overly quantitative designs for missing meanings; structural theorists might argue that micro-level qualitative work overlooks how class or global capitalism shapes opportunities. Be ready to justify how your method connects to the theoretical question you are asking.

## Strengths, limitations and ways to improve research quality
Every method has strengths and limits, and exam answers gain marks by weighing these carefully and suggesting realistic improvements. Questionnaires score highly on reliability and scale but struggle with validity and depth; combining questionnaires with interviews can add explanation to measurement. Observations offer validity in capturing behaviour, but observer effects can distort findings; using overt and covert techniques strategically, or longer-term immersion, can reduce reactivity. Official statistics are invaluable for trends and comparisons, yet they are shaped by definitions and recording practices and never tell the full story of lived experience. Triangulation — using multiple methods and sources — is a powerful way to bolster validity and provide a fuller picture. Reflexivity, the practice of acknowledging how the researcher’s identity and position influence the research, strengthens the credibility of qualitative work. When you evaluate methods, be precise about which aspects of quality you are addressing: validity, reliability, representativeness, practical feasibility, ethics and theoretical fit.

## Examples of Methods in Context applied to education
Imagine a research question about why working-class boys underachieve in secondary schools. A large-scale questionnaire distributed across multiple schools could identify patterns linked to family background, part-time work or attitudes to education. To explain these patterns, semi-structured interviews with pupils, parents and teachers would reveal meanings attached to schoolwork and future aspirations. Classroom observations could show how teacher expectations and labeling influence pupil identities and subcultures. Official statistics on attainment by free school meal status and local authority funding would provide structural context, while school policy documents could be analysed to see how marketisation and selection shape opportunities. A mixed-methods approach combining these techniques would enable you to claim both representativeness and depth. In another scenario, evaluating a new anti-bullying policy might use a quasi-experimental design comparing schools with and without the policy, supported by interviews to understand implementation and student perceptions. These applied examples should be the model for Methods in Context answers: start with a clear question, choose methods that can realistically answer it, and anticipate limitations.

## Linking methods to theory and policy
Methods do not exist in isolation from theory or from the policy context. Structural approaches such as Marxism and functionalism tend to focus on large-scale, often quantitative evidence about class structures, social functions and inequality, making official statistics and comparative studies attractive. Interpretivist and interactionist approaches favour qualitative methods that uncover meanings and interactional processes, such as observations and in-depth interviews. Feminist research highlights power relations and may prioritise methods that give voice to marginalised groups, emphasising ethics, empowerment and reflexivity. When writing about policy implications, show how different types of evidence inform different kinds of recommendations. Quantitative trends might justify redistributive funding or national interventions, whereas qualitative insights might recommend targeted, context-sensitive programmes or changes in professional practice. Good Method in Context answers explicitly link the method, the theoretical perspective it supports, and the implications for understanding or addressing the social problem.

## Exam technique
When you face a Methods in Context question, read the scenario carefully and identify the specific research question or problem. Start by summarising the most relevant methodological choices and explain why each choice is appropriate to the question, linking method to the knowledge you want to produce. Always discuss strengths and limitations in relation to the scenario rather than listing generic pros and cons: refer to validity, reliability, representativeness, ethics and practical feasibility as they apply to the given context. Where possible, suggest concrete ways to improve the study, such as mixing methods, piloting instruments, using stratified sampling to ensure representation of key groups, or applying reflexive practices to address researcher bias. Make theoretical links by indicating which approaches the chosen methods align with and how that affects interpretation. Use short, specific examples drawn from contemporary UK contexts — for instance, citing how league tables shape school behaviour or how migration patterns influence classroom composition — to show awareness of the social setting. Conclude by weighing up the overall likely usefulness of the proposed approach, making a clear judgement that answers the question and shows evaluative depth. Timing is important: allocate time to apply methods, evaluate, and reach a supported conclusion, and aim to interweave evidence, theory and methodological critique rather than treating them as separate sections.
