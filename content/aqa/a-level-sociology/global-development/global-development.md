# Global Development (A-level Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: what we mean by development
Global development is about more than rising GDP figures; it concerns the quality of people's lives, the distribution of resources and power, and the social changes that accompany economic transformation. At A-level you will need to distinguish between economic growth (an increase in output) and development (broader improvements in health, education, life chances and freedoms). Sociology treats development as a social process shaped by history, institutions and global relationships. Studying global development brings together evidence about income, health, education and political power with theories that explain why some societies prosper while others struggle, and with critical debates about who benefits from development and at what cost.

## Measuring development: indicators and their limits
A clear starting point is how development is measured. Traditional indicators such as GDP and GNI per capita capture aggregate economic output but miss distributional and social dimensions. Composite measures like the Human Development Index (HDI) combine income with life expectancy and educational attainment to give a broader picture, while inequality measures (Gini coefficient), poverty lines (absolute versus relative), and indicators for health, literacy and gender parity add further nuance. It is important to be aware of the limitations of these measures: GDP can rise while most people see little benefit; average indicators mask internal inequalities; and many indicators fail to capture informal economies, unpaid care work or cultural forms of well-being. In exam answers you should define indicators, use them to describe patterns, and be prepared to evaluate their adequacy.

## Theories: modernisation, dependency, world-systems and post-development
Competing theories offer different explanations for development and underdevelopment. Modernisation theory suggests that societies follow a linear path from traditional to modern, with industrialisation, secularisation and education driving progress; policy prescriptions associated with this view favour investment, industrialisation and cultural change. Dependency theory and Wallerstein’s world-systems approach argue instead that historical processes of colonisation and an unequal global economy create structural constraints: peripheral countries are integrated into the world market in ways that perpetuate their subordinate position and extract value for the core. More recent perspectives include neoliberal explanations that emphasise market liberalisation and private investment, and post-development critiques that question whether the idea of ‘development’ itself is ethnocentric and harmful. In essays you should explain these theories, apply them to empirical patterns, and assess their strengths and weaknesses.

## Actors: states, transnational corporations, NGOs and international agencies
Development is driven by a mix of actors operating at different scales. Nation states design and implement economic and social policy, but transnational corporations (TNCs) increasingly shape investment patterns, production and labour conditions through global value chains. International agencies such as the World Bank, IMF and WTO influence development through finance, lending conditions and trade rules, often promoting structural adjustment and liberalisation. Non-governmental organisations and international NGOs provide humanitarian relief, run development projects and lobby for policy change; some, like Oxfam or Médecins Sans Frontières, enjoy high public profiles, while many smaller grassroots organisations work at the local level. Each actor has its own interests, incentives and power, and their interactions produce a mix of beneficial and harmful outcomes for local populations. Exam answers should show an awareness of these different roles and give examples of how they shape development on the ground.

## Processes: aid and trade, industrialisation, urbanisation, the environment and conflict
Major processes that shape development include the flow of aid and trade relations, patterns of industrialisation, rapid urbanisation, environmental change and the impact of war or conflict. Aid can be humanitarian, short-term or long-term development assistance; it can be bilateral, multilateral or provided by NGOs. While aid has supported health and education in many places, it has also been criticised for creating dependency, being tied to donor interests, or reinforcing elite capture. Trade policies—whether import substitution industrialisation, export-led growth strategies, or neoliberal free trade—have produced very different results in different contexts; South Korea’s state-led industrialisation contrasts with the stagnation experienced in some resource-rich African states. Urbanisation produces megacities and slums alike: while cities can be engines of growth and opportunity, they may also concentrate poverty and precarious informal employment. Environmental issues and climate change increasingly complicate development, as poorer countries face disproportionate risks from resource depletion and extreme weather despite contributing less to the causes. Conflict and instability often reverse development gains, displacing populations and destroying infrastructure. Use concrete examples, such as China’s industrial rise, the urban growth of Lagos and Mumbai, or the environmental challenges faced by small island states, to illustrate these processes.

## Development and social dimensions: employment, education, health, demographics and gender
Development is felt through everyday social outcomes. Employment patterns shift with industrialisation and global value chains; in some contexts work moves from agriculture to manufacturing and services, while in others informal or precarious work becomes dominant. Education expands opportunities and is central to human development, but unequal access reproduces class, gender and regional disparities. Health outcomes—life expectancy, maternal and child mortality, the burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases—reflect and shape development trajectories; outbreaks such as Ebola or COVID-19 demonstrate how health crises can derail progress. Demographic change, explained by the demographic transition model, affects dependency ratios, labour supply and long-term welfare needs; countries at different stages of the transition face distinct challenges. Gender is a cross-cutting issue: development processes can create new opportunities for women while also reinforcing inequalities through gendered labour markets, unpaid care burdens and differing access to education and health. When answering questions, link these social dimensions to the broader political-economic context and to theories about inequality and power.

## Policies, debates and contemporary initiatives
Debates about how best to promote development are ongoing. Neoliberal policies favour privatization, deregulation and market-led growth, and were widely promoted in the late twentieth century through structural adjustment programmes; critics argue these policies often undermined public services and increased inequality. Alternatives include state-led development models, social democratic approaches that combine market activity with robust welfare provision, and participatory or rights-based development that foregrounds local agency. Contemporary initiatives such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to integrate poverty reduction, environmental sustainability and social inclusion within a single agenda. Climate justice activists emphasise the responsibility of rich countries for historical emissions and press for finance and technology transfer. The rise of new donors and models, for example China’s Belt and Road infrastructure investments and South–South cooperation, adds complexity to global development governance. In essays you should be able to outline these policy approaches, assess evidence of their outcomes, and consider trade-offs between growth, inequality and sustainability.

## Case study approach: using evidence effectively
Good answers use well-chosen case studies to illustrate arguments. Comparative examples are particularly effective: contrast the rapid, state-led development of South Korea and Taiwan with the resource-dependent economies of some African states to show how institutions and historical legacies matter. Micro-level case studies, such as a successful microfinance project or an NGO health intervention, can be used to test broader theories and to show both successes and limits. Always explain why a case is relevant, how it connects to theory, and what general lesson it provides. Where possible, refer to data—trends in GDP per capita, HDI changes, poverty rates, or Gini coefficients—to ground your points. Remember that case studies should support your argument rather than replace analysis: use them to demonstrate understanding of mechanisms, causation and complexity.

## Exam technique
When answering Global Development questions in A-level papers, start by identifying the assessment objectives: AO1 calls for clear definitions and relevant knowledge, AO2 requires application to issues and examples, and AO3 demands analysis and evaluation. For shorter questions, offer precise definitions of key terms (for example, distinguish development from growth), present one or two theoretical perspectives, and give a focused example. For extended essays, plan a clear structure with an introduction that outlines the argument and defines terms, several analytical paragraphs that integrate theory and empirical evidence, and a conclusion that draws a balanced judgement. Balance is crucial: for evaluative questions show understanding of competing explanations, consider strengths and limitations of both theory and evidence, and address counter-arguments. Time management matters; allocate time for planning and for a final review to ensure clarity and completeness. Use sociological concepts and link answers to the core themes of socialisation, culture and identity, and social differentiation, power and stratification where appropriate—for instance, discuss how gendered socialisation affects development outcomes or how global power relations shape trade policy. Finally, demonstrate methodological awareness by noting how data are collected, the advantages and limits of particular indicators, and how different research methods might produce different insights into development processes.
