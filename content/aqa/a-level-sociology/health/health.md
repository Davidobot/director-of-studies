# Health (A-level Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What 'health' means in sociology
In sociology, health is not treated simply as a biological state but as a social phenomenon shaped by ideas, institutions and power. Sociologists distinguish between disease, a biological malfunction, and illness, the lived experience and social meaning of being unwell. The concept of the body is also socially constructed: what counts as a normal body, a disabled body, or a body in need of medical intervention varies across time and place. Competing models help students organise understanding. The biomedical model frames health as absence of pathology and locates problems in individuals; the social model emphasises social causes, environmental conditions and the role of social responses in producing disability and ill-health. Medicalisation describes the process by which non-medical problems become defined and treated as medical issues, while biomedicalisation highlights the expansion of biomedical knowledge and technology into everyday life. Understanding these terminologies helps when analysing policies, professional practice and public debates about health.

## The unequal social distribution of health
Health is distributed unevenly across society. Social class, gender, ethnicity and region are powerful predictors of differences in life chances and health outcomes. Class gradients are striking: people from lower socioeconomic groups tend to experience more chronic conditions, shorter life expectancy and higher rates of preventable illness. Gender differences are complex; women often report higher rates of morbidity and use health services more, while men have higher rates of premature mortality for certain causes. Ethnic inequalities may reflect socioeconomic position, discrimination in services, cultural barriers and differential exposure to risk. Regional variations within the United Kingdom are visible in life expectancy, infant mortality and incidence of long-term conditions; areas of persistent deprivation show worse health across many indicators. Sociological explanations include materialist accounts that focus on poverty, housing, work and diet; psychosocial accounts that emphasise stress and relative deprivation; and life-course approaches that trace how disadvantage accumulates from childhood into adulthood. Contemporary debates also consider how global forces, migration and austerity policies shape these patterns. Using empirical evidence in essays—such as statistics on life expectancy gaps or examples of health inequalities revealed during major public health crises—demonstrates understanding and application.

## Inequalities in provision and access to health care
Access to health care and the organisation of services are central to sociological study of health. In the UK context, the National Health Service represents a model of universal provision, but access remains uneven. Geographical differences—often referred to as the "postcode lottery"—can mean variation in waiting times, availability of specialist services and funding priorities between local areas. Marketisation and privatisation trends have introduced more private provision, competition and consumerist models into health systems, raising questions about equality of access and the impact on disadvantaged groups. Barriers to access can be practical, such as transport and cost, or cultural and institutional, such as language, trust in services and discriminatory treatment. Health policy decisions about resource allocation, eligibility for services and public health priorities are shaped by political choices, budgets and professional interests. To understand how provision and access influence health outcomes, it is important to link structural factors—state organisation, funding regimes and policy shifts—to individual experiences of care.

## Mental illness: social distribution, meanings and debates
Mental illness provides a clear locus for sociological analysis because it sits at the intersection of medical definitions, social stigma and lived experience. Rates and recognition of mental health problems vary by social group, with links to poverty, unemployment, social isolation and traumatic life events. Sociologists debate whether observed differences reflect social causation—where disadvantage increases risk—or social drift—where illness leads to downward social mobility. Medicalisation of distress has widened diagnostic categories and increased psychiatric intervention, while critics argue this can obscure social causes and normalise pharmaceutical solutions. Stigma remains a powerful social force affecting concealment, help-seeking and recovery. Students should be able to discuss how social policies, welfare regimes and the provision of community mental health services shape outcomes, and illustrate arguments with examples such as trends in antidepressant prescribing, suicide statistics, or the impact of austerity and cuts to mental health services. Intersectional analysis is especially useful here: the combined effects of class, gender, ethnicity and age produce different mental health experiences.

## The role of medicine, health professions and the health industry
Medicine and health professions occupy a central position in defining and managing health. Sociologists examine professionalism, medical authority and the social control that clinical systems exercise. Concepts like medical dominance capture how doctors historically controlled knowledge, access to treatments and the organisation of care, though shifts towards multidisciplinary teams, patient choice and managerialism have complicated this picture. The globalised health industry—including pharmaceutical companies, biotech firms and private healthcare providers—has transformed research priorities, medication availability and the commercialisation of health. Pharmaceutical influence extends to funding of clinical trials, marketing and shaping clinical guidelines, raising ethical and policy questions. The changing role of patients—from passive recipients to active consumers and informed decision-makers—has implications for power relations in consultations and for health inequalities, because consumerist models may advantage those with resources and health literacy. Analysing the interplay between professional power, industry interests and patient agency helps explain contemporary patterns of treatment, innovation and controversy.

## Globalisation, pandemics and the international health landscape
Health issues increasingly transcend national borders. Globalisation affects health through the spread of lifestyles, environmental consequences, transnational labour markets and the movement of pathogens. Pandemics vividly illustrate global interconnectedness: rapid global travel can turn local outbreaks into international crises, while global supply chains and uneven vaccine access reveal stark inequalities between countries. International organisations, non-governmental organisations and pharmaceutical companies play influential roles in framing priorities, funding interventions and delivering services in low- and middle-income settings. Debates in global health also address dependency, the role of aid, and whether development strategies reproduce inequality or foster sustainable improvements. Case studies such as responses to recent pandemics, global campaigns against infectious diseases, and the politics of intellectual property rights for medicines provide rich material for application to theory and evaluation in exam answers.

## Research methods for studying health
Researching health sociologically requires a mix of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data—surveys, routine statistics and epidemiological studies—are essential for measuring patterns, comparing groups and tracking trends. Qualitative methods—interviews, ethnography, participant observation and case studies—reveal meanings, experiences and the subtleties of interactions in clinical settings. Documents, policy texts and media representations are useful for analysing discourse about health and how social problems become framed. Choice of method is shaped by theoretical perspective: positivists tend towards measurement and generalisation, while interpretivists prioritise understanding lived experience. Ethical issues are particularly salient in health research because of vulnerability, confidentiality and the potential for harm. When answering "methods in context" questions on health, students should explicitly justify why a particular method fits the research question, discuss practical and ethical strengths and limitations, and consider validity, reliability and representativeness. Examples might include designing a survey to compare access to services in different regions, or using in-depth interviews to explore patient experiences of a long-term condition.

## Applying sociological theory to health
The major sociological perspectives offer distinct explanations for health phenomena and are required throughout A-level assessment. Functionalist accounts view health as necessary for social stability and focus on the roles of institutions such as the NHS and public health systems. Marxist and neo-Marxist analyses emphasise class inequalities, capitalist interests and the commodification of health, drawing attention to how economic structures produce illness and shape healthcare provision. Weberian approaches highlight the role of bureaucracy, rationalisation and market actors in organising medical care, and analyse how status and power shape access. Interactionist perspectives concentrate on doctor–patient interactions, labelling processes and the social construction of illness, while feminist theories critique gendered experiences of health and the medical profession's treatment of women's bodies. Postmodern perspectives interrogate biomedicalisation, the plurality of health knowledges and the fragmentation of authority. Strong exam answers integrate theory with empirical examples, use theoretical concepts to explain patterns, and evaluate strengths and weaknesses of each perspective in accounting for specific health issues.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on health, begin by making clear definitions of key terms and state the relevant sociological perspective or concept to frame your response. Use theory and evidence throughout: AO1 requires accurate knowledge and understanding, AO2 demands application to the question context, and AO3 asks for analysis and evaluation. For shorter questions allocate time to concise definition and a focused example; for extended essays plan a coherent structure with an introduction that sets out your argument, body paragraphs that develop points with sociological theory and empirical evidence, and a conclusion that makes a balanced judgement. In "methods in context" questions, explicitly link method choice to the health topic, discuss practical and ethical issues and assess strengths and limitations in context. Use contemporary and historical examples where appropriate—such as NHS reforms, documented health inequalities, or pandemic responses—to illustrate points, but always tie examples back to sociological explanation. Evaluate alternative explanations, consider counterarguments and address implications for policy where relevant; examiners reward answers that show critical awareness, make clear comparisons between perspectives, and draw reasoned conclusions. Finally, practice timing by answering past questions under timed conditions and annotate model answers to internalise how to combine AO1, AO2 and AO3 effectively.
