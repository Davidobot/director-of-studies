# The Making of a Superpower: USA (1865–1975) (A-level History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview and organising themes
The period 1865–1975 traces the transformation of the United States from a fractured post‑Civil War republic into a global superpower with extensive economic, military and cultural influence. For A‑level study it helps to organise this long sweep around several recurring questions: how political authority and parties adapted to changing social and economic realities; how industrialisation and urbanisation remade everyday life and regional balances of power; how the United States’ role in world affairs shifted from cautious isolation to global engagement; and how ideas — about race, capitalism, democracy and national purpose — shaped policy and conflict. These themes allow you to link specific events to broader processes of change and continuity across a span of roughly 110 years, which is exactly what exam questions demand.

## From Reconstruction to the Gilded Age (1865–1890)
The immediate challenge after 1865 was the reintegration of the defeated Confederate states and defining the status of four million newly freed African Americans. Radical Reconstruction produced constitutional change — the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments — and a brief period of federal activism in the South, but the compromise that ended Reconstruction in 1877 and the retreat of federal will allowed white supremacist regimes to reassert control through disenfranchisement and Jim Crow laws. Politically, the era featured weak presidents and strong, often corrupt, party machines; the Gilded Age was dominated by business interests, railways and financial capital. Rapid industrial growth created national corporations and "captains of industry" such as Carnegie and Rockefeller, while urbanisation and immigration reshaped the social landscape. Teaching emphasis here is on linking the limits of federal power and the rise of corporate capitalism to the social tensions that produced populism and later reform movements.

## Populism, Progressivism and the turn to empire (1890–1920)
The closing decades of the nineteenth century and the first two of the twentieth century saw both popular challenge and reform. The Populist movement channelled agrarian distress into political critique, while the Progressive movement translated concerns about corporate power, urban poverty and corruption into political reforms at municipal, state and national levels. Progressives pushed for regulatory institutions, direct primaries, civil service reform and social legislation; figures like Theodore Roosevelt embodied a more activist presidency. Abroad, the Spanish‑American War (1898) and the acquisition of territories in the Caribbean and the Philippines marked a decisive American engagement with imperial politics, and the building of the Panama Canal signalled strategic ambitions. The First World War accelerated the US transition to a creditor and arms supplier; Wilson’s internationalism contrasted with a domestic return to isolationism after 1918. When teaching this section, stress the contrast between reformist language and continuing limits to political inclusion, especially for African Americans and many immigrant communities.

## Crisis, recovery and war: 1920–1945
The 1920s brought Republican pro‑business policies and cultural ferment, but beneath the surface lay instability. The Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression exposed structural weaknesses and prompted a debate over the role of federal government that defined mid‑century American politics. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal marked a major expansion of federal responsibility: public works, unemployment relief, banking reform and the Social Security system changed expectations about state action. Historians dispute whether the New Deal represented a social revolution or pragmatic crisis management, a useful question to bring into essays. Internationally, the Second World War finally ended large‑scale American isolation. Mobilisation transformed the economy, reunited the regions economically and demographically, and positioned the United States as the principal arsenal and financier of the Allied victory. The wartime alliance with the Soviet Union soon dissolved into Cold War rivalry, shaped by the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan and the creation of NATO.

## The Cold War, domestic politics and the rise of the Superpower (1945–1975)
From 1945 the United States assumed global leadership of the capitalist bloc. Containment of Soviet influence framed policy in Europe, Asia and beyond and led to direct military engagement in Korea and — later — Vietnam. The postwar economic boom produced mass consumerism, suburbanisation, the GI Bill’s expansion of higher education, and a culture of affluence that reshaped class and regional balances. Politically, the period saw the ebb and flow of party fortunes: Truman’s containment and Fair Deal ambitions, Eisenhower’s moderate Republicanism, Kennedy’s New Frontier optimism, Johnson’s Great Society and the conservative retrenchment culminating in Nixon. The Vietnam War, televised and divisive, exposed limits to American power and intensified domestic polarization. By 1975 the US remained a Superpower in military and economic terms, but the end of Saigon, rising inflation, energy shocks and political scandals such as Watergate revealed constraints and a crisis of confidence in government. When teaching this era, encourage students to weigh material and ideological sources of American strengths against the limits highlighted by Vietnam and domestic unrest.

## Society, culture and the politics of identity
Social change runs through the narrative as both cause and effect. The Great Migration of African Americans to northern cities, the labour movement’s growth, waves of immigration, and the evolving role of women transformed urban life and electoral coalitions. The Civil Rights movement from Brown v. Board (1954) through the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the March on Washington and landmark legislation in the 1960s shows how grassroots activism, legal strategy and federal power combined to break legal segregation even while economic and social inequalities persisted. Parallel movements — the rise of Black Power, the New Left, feminist activism and student protest — complicated politics and culture, while McCarthyism and anti‑communist anxieties shaped domestic repression in the early Cold War. For teaching, model essays that link social movements to political responses and policy changes, demonstrating continuity and challenge across decades.

## Key debates and interpretations to use in essays
Historians disagree on major questions you will face in essays: whether the New Deal permanently transformed capitalism or merely stabilised it; whether American foreign policy was fundamentally imperialist or defensive; whether post‑war prosperity produced social cohesion or masked deep inequality. Use these debates to frame "To what extent" answers: set out the interpretative options, deploy evidence for each, and reach a balanced judgement. Examples work well: contrast interpretations that see Roosevelt’s relief and reform as revolutionary with those that emphasise the persistence of business power; use the Vietnam case to weigh Cold War strategic logic against critiques of imperial overreach. Always place interpretations in context by noting when and why a historian wrote: immediate postwar anti‑communist writing differs in tone from revisionist accounts written after Vietnam.

## Exam technique
Start every answer with a brief plan and a clear thesis that answers the question directly. In essays that demand causation or change over time, structure paragraphs thematically and chronologically so each develops a single line of argument supported by specific evidence: legislation, Supreme Court decisions, presidents’ policies, economic statistics, or well‑chosen examples such as the Homestead Strike, the New Deal agencies (CCC, WPA, Social Security), Brown v. Board, or the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. For questions requiring evaluation of interpretations, set out the competing views early, explain the basis of each (sources, political context, historian’s assumptions), and assess their strengths and weaknesses with concrete evidence. When a source or provenance question appears in Component 2, assess content, authorship, purpose and audience and then relate those factors to the wider context to judge usefulness and limitations. Time management is crucial: for a 2 hour 30 paper, divide time so the interpretation/source question gets about one hour and each essay about 45 minutes; leave five minutes for a crisp conclusion that reiterates your judgement. Use historiography strategically rather than as decoration: historians’ views should illuminate your argument, not replace factual analysis. Finally, practise past papers under timed conditions, annotate model answers to see how examiners reward balance and precision, and ensure every paragraph advances an argument rather than merely narrating events.
