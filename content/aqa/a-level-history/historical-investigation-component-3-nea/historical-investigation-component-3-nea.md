# Historical Investigation (Component 3, NEA) (A-level History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What the Historical Investigation is and why it matters
The Historical Investigation is the non-exam assessment that makes up 20% of A-level History and is designed to develop the skills of independent historical enquiry students will need at university and beyond. It must take the form of sustained, analytical prose of between 3,500 and 4,500 words, focused on a question framed within roughly a 100 year context and must not duplicate material used for Components 1 or 2. The task is not a report or a long narrative; it is an extended piece of historical argument in which you ask a focussed question, marshal evidence from both primary and secondary material, evaluate that evidence, and reach a balanced judgement. The Investigation tests three assessment objectives: AO1 (knowledge, analysis and judgement), AO2 (analysis of primary sources), and AO3 (evaluation of historians’ interpretations). Understanding the purpose of each objective will shape how you plan, research and write the Investigation.

## Choosing your issue and formulating a question
Choosing the right topic and question is the single most important step. The topic must allow you to explore development, continuity and change over approximately a century, or to place a narrower issue into that wider timescale. Good questions are analytical and contestable: they often begin “To what extent…”, “How far…”, or “Assess the validity of…”. A successful question will be narrow enough to research thoroughly within the word limit, but broad enough to require contextual knowledge across the century. Think in terms of problems historians debate. For example, rather than “What happened in 1649?”, a stronger investigation would be “To what extent did the Glorious Revolution settle relations between Crown and Parliament in Britain?”. Before you proceed you must get formal approval: your centre must submit the NEA title approval form to AQA by 20 October in the year before certification. AQA will check the chronological framing, ensure there is no overlap with Components 1 and 2, and that together the three components cover at least 200 years. Failure to meet these administrative conditions risks the entry being invalidated, so treat the proposal stage as part of the assessment.

## Research strategy and use of sources
Successful investigations are built on disciplined research. You should aim to consult a substantial range of secondary literature to understand the debates around your question, and a good selection of primary sources to test those interpretations and to build your own argument. The specification requires explicit analysis of three primary sources, from at least two different types: for example, official documents, private letters, newspapers, visual material or artefacts. Choose sources that illuminate different perspectives – elite and popular, domestic and foreign, official and private. When selecting secondary material, prioritise academic historians and monographs or articles in scholarly journals rather than textbooks. You will be required to evaluate two differing interpretations by academic historians in your Investigation; this must be explicit and critical, not merely descriptive. Keep careful records of every item you consult and create a bibliography as you go. Use footnotes to show the source of quotations and specific facts; this both strengthens the academic quality of your work and protects you from accusations of plagiarism.

## Analysing primary sources (AO2): what to look for
When you evaluate primary sources, move beyond what they say to ask why they were produced, by whom, for what audience, and in what context. Consider provenance, purpose, tone, reliability and what the source leaves out. A useful approach is to place each source in its historical moment and test how well it supports or complicates your argument. For example, a government proclamation must be read alongside popular diaries or local petitions to assess whether the official narrative reflects lived experience. Remember that evaluation should be targeted: general comments about “bias” are weaker than precise discussion of the author’s position, incentives and constraints. Make sure you apply your own contextual knowledge when you assess sources; AO2 is about using sources as historical evidence, not about mere source commentary in isolation. The mark scheme rewards balanced and well-supported judgements about three sources and their relative value for your specific question.

## Engaging with historiography (AO3): how to evaluate interpretations
The Investigation requires analysis and evaluation of differing historical interpretations. This is not an exercise in naming historians; it is about engaging with their arguments, methods and contexts. For each interpretation you discuss, ask what questions the historian was addressing, what sources and methods they used, when they wrote, and how that temporal and intellectual context might have shaped their conclusions. For instance, historians writing in the immediate post-war decades often emphasised structural economic explanations, whereas later work may stress culture or gender. Compare interpretations on their evidential basis and on their explanatory power for your question. You must analyse at least two different academic interpretations and explain why one might be more convincing than another for specific parts of your argument, while acknowledging limitations. Demonstrating awareness of historians’ constraints and the provisional nature of historical judgements will move your AO3 beyond description into sustained evaluation.

## Structure, argument and presentation (AO1 and overall approach)
Treat the Investigation as an essay that tells a reasoned story from introduction to conclusion. Your introduction should set out the question, explain why it matters, define any key terms, and outline the approach and structure. The body of the Investigation should develop a sustained argument supported by evidence and by engagement with historians’ views. Integrate primary source analysis and historiographical evaluation within the argument rather than tacking them on as separate sections. Make sure you address change and continuity across the century context, because lack of engagement with change and continuity limits AO1 marks. Use paragraphs to build stages of argument; signpost your line of enquiry and make transitions clear. The conclusion should answer the question directly, weigh evidence, acknowledge remaining uncertainties, and offer a short reflective comment on the broader significance of your findings. Presentation matters: include a formal bibliography, consistent and accurate footnotes, and a word count on the Candidate Record Form. The specification penalises submissions over 4,500 words with a five-mark deduction applied by AQA, so plan your writing to fit the limit.

## Practicalities, academic integrity and the teacher’s role
The Investigation must be the student’s own work and must be supervised in line with AQA guidance. Teachers may advise on the suitability of a question, check for overlap with Components 1 and 2, and monitor progress without providing corrective comments on drafts. When reviewing drafts teachers can ask questions that prompt the student to think, but must not give specific suggestions that would improve the answer. Plagiarism, collusion and other malpractice are treated seriously; students must not submit work that is not their own, must acknowledge all sources, and must not reuse the same set of primary materials in identical ways if several students are working on a similar topic. Each student signs the Candidate Record Form to confirm authenticity and the teacher countersigns to confirm appropriate supervision and internal standardisation. The centre will internally standardise marking and will provide annotation to show how marks were awarded against the marking criteria; AQA moderators then sample work and may adjust marks to align with national standards. Keep original material secure until moderation is complete, and retain copies in line with centre guidance.

## Exam technique
Plan rigorously before you start writing and keep the assessment objectives in mind as you work. Start with a clear, well-focused question and a short plan that allocates space to context, argument development, source evaluation and historiographical engagement. Write a concise introduction that defines the terms and states your argument, then use each main section to develop a line of reasoning supported by both primary evidence and scholarly debate. Integrate source evaluation into your argument by showing how particular documents support, complicate or undermine historians’ claims. When discussing historians, explain why their dates, aims or sources might have shaped their judgments – this demonstrates AO3. Manage your word count by drafting to the upper limit and then editing ruthlessly: remove repetition, tighten paragraphs, and ensure every sentence advances your argument. Use footnotes to attribute specific evidence and quotations and include a bibliography listing primary and secondary works consulted. Before submission, check that you have explicitly analysed three primary sources (from at least two types), engaged with two differing academic interpretations, and explained change and continuity within your chosen century context; failing to demonstrate these requirements will limit marks or invalidate the entry. Finally, ensure the Candidate Record Form is complete and signed, and keep copies of all documents submitted: careful administration and academic rigour are as important to success as historical insight.
