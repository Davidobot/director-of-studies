# The Tudors: England 1485–1603 (A-level History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction and the big questions
The Tudor period, from Henry VII’s seizure of the throne in 1485 to the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, is a compact century of dramatic change and vivid personalities. Students studying this breadth topic are asked to think across the whole period about the restoration and development of monarchical power, the changing nature of government, England’s place in Europe, social and economic transformation, and the profound religious and intellectual shifts that altered ordinary life. Useful organising questions are: how effectively did the Tudors restore and develop royal power; how was England governed; how did foreign relations and succession issues shape policy; how did economy and society change; and how far did religious and intellectual ideas transform England? Keeping these questions in mind gives your study a coherent spine: individual events and reforms can be weighed in relation to longer-term change and to competing interpretations.

## Henry VII: securing the dynasty and rebuilding authority (1485–1509)
Henry VII’s reign is best understood as the work of consolidation after civil war. He needed to make the Tudor claim safe and the Crown solvent. Politically he combined traditional institutions — royal councils, the courts and Parliament — with more modern fiscal and administrative devices. The Crown’s finances were augmented through a careful exploitation of feudal dues and bonds and recognisances which disciplined potentially dangerous nobles; at the same time the Council Learned in the Law and a revitalised household and chancery system made royal government more efficient. Henry pursued a cautious foreign policy based on securing the succession through advantageous marriages and a balance among European powers rather than adventurous warfare. Economically, late 15th‑century England saw the continuing importance of cloth exports and increasing engagement in overseas trade; socially, the landholding elite remained dominant but the period also saw the slow growth of a commercial and professional middling sort. For students it is helpful to contrast interpretations which view Henry as a miserly, autocratic usurper with those that argue he created a stable, modern monarchy; both views can be supported by concrete evidence about finance, law and local government.

## Henry VIII and the Reformation: power, policy and social consequences (1509–1547)
Henry VIII’s reign is dominated by two linked themes: an expansion of monarchical visibility and authority, and the religious rupture with Rome which produces enduring constitutional change. Early in his reign the king’s government was energetic and ambitious: Thomas Wolsey and later Thomas Cromwell extended central administration, managed taxation and law reform, and confronted social tensions. The ‘Great Matter’ — Henry’s divorce and desire for a male heir — led to a constitutional revolution in which Parliament, the king’s ministers and the royal law were used to establish Royal Supremacy. The Reformation in England was not a single, clear‑cut process. It combined doctrinal, political and administrative change; policies such as the Dissolution of the Monasteries redistributed wealth and altered local and charitable structures, creating both social dislocation and opportunities for new landholders. The Pilgrimage of Grace (1536–37) and other outbreaks remind us that change met resistance and that religious identity was contested at parish level. Economically, exploratory voyages and expanding trade began to generate the sights and rhetoric of future expansion. When explaining this period in exams, place emphasis on the complex causes of Henry’s break with Rome — dynastic anxiety, factional politics, and the opportunities the rupture created for transforming the machinery of the state — and give examples of local impact such as the fate of monastic almsgiving and parish life.

## Mid‑Tudor crisis and the Elizabethan Settlement (1547–1563)
The years after Henry VIII’s death are often described as a period of instability: Edward VI’s minority introduced radical Protestant reforms under Protectors Somerset and Northumberland; economic distress, inflation and enclosure disputes fed social unrest such as the rebellions of 1549; and the succession crisis following Edward’s death brought factional manoeuvring. Mary I’s accession reversed much Protestant legislation, restored Papal authority and attempted to reverse the Reformation; her marriage to Philip of Spain and the Marian persecutions, however, polarised opinion and left unresolved religious divisions. Elizabeth I’s accession in 1558 required cautious politics. Her Religious Settlement of 1559 — the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity and a deliberately via media approach — aimed to create national conformity without provoking the extremes of Protestants or Catholics. The mid‑Tudor period is a key moment to explore change and continuity: religious policy oscillated, but the pattern of using Parliament and state administration to implement national policy was now established. In essays, treat the term ‘mid‑Tudor crisis’ as interpretative: show evidence for instability and for the resilience of institutions and explain why historians disagree.

## Elizabethan triumphs and limits, 1563–1603
Elizabeth’s later reign saw the survival and eventual triumph of her settlement but also continuing challenges abroad and at home. Government under Elizabeth relied on a small Privy Council, skilful ministers such as William Cecil (Lord Burghley) and Robert Cecil, and a growing culture of patronage and faction. Foreign policy was shaped by the problems of succession, the fate of Mary, Queen of Scots, and the expansion of Spanish power. The 1580s brought the Dutch Revolt, increasing tension with Philip II, and the 1588 Armada crisis, after which English naval power and maritime privateering enhanced national confidence. Economically and socially the period was mixed: commercial expansion, exploration and the beginnings of colonial ambition sat alongside recurring depressions, inflationary pressures, and regional hardship. Culturally the later Tudor age is famous for the ‘Golden Age’ of drama, poetry and music — the work of writers and composers had a national reach and reflected a new sense of Englishness. Yet the monarchy at Elizabeth’s death faced questions about succession, and the state that had matured under Tudor rule remained financially and militarily limited. When answering exam questions, balance praise for Tudor achievements with an assessment of structural weaknesses that explain why the Tudor state had enduring limits.

## Society, economy and regional variation across the Tudors
A useful way to study the period is thematically. Population grew during the sixteenth century, putting pressure on wages and food supplies and contributing to inflation. Agriculture remained dominant, but enclosure and the movement towards sheep‑raising disrupted traditional patterns and fuelled social protest. Urban growth, especially in cloth towns, fostered a commercial capitalist class while cities and ports became centres of exchange and political opinion. Poor relief evolved from local charity to statutory systems by the century’s end, as state actors increasingly addressed poverty and vagrancy. Regionally, the north of England often lagged behind the south in wealth and administration and was more prone to Catholic resistance; Wales and the Marches were increasingly integrated into Tudor governance. Ireland presented a persistent frontier problem and the Tudors’ approach combined military intervention with plantation attempts that would have long consequences. In answers, use case studies — for example, the Midlands enclosure debates, the cloth trade of East Anglia, or the northern Rising of the Earls — to show how national policies played out locally.

## Interpreting the Tudors: approaches and debates
Historiographical awareness is essential for high‑level answers. Historians have long debated whether the Tudors produced a modern, centralised state or whether changes were partial and fragile. The view that Tudor monarchs strengthened royal government through legal and financial reforms can be balanced against arguments stressing continued reliance on local elites and the limits of royal capacity. Religious historians dispute how ‘Reformation’ England really was: was the English Reformation a top‑down administrative change or a deeper spiritual transformation? Debates also surround the so‑called ‘mid‑Tudor crisis’ and the nature of Elizabethan stability: some scholars emphasise economic and social stress, others highlight adaptability and cultural flourishing. Use these debates to frame AO3-style responses: present differing scholarly views, explain their basis, and evaluate them in light of primary evidence such as parliamentary statutes, proclamations, parish returns, and eyewitness accounts.

## Exam technique
Answering Tudors questions requires precision, chronology and judicious use of evidence. For essay questions that assess AO1, start with a short plan that clarifies the argument and signposts the structure. Each paragraph should open with a focused point that links to the question, develop with detailed evidence — names, dates, statutes, incidents — and end with a mini‑judgement explaining how the evidence affects your overall case. Avoid narrative for its own sake; always connect events to the question’s demands about causation, change and significance. When asked to evaluate interpretations (AO3), introduce two or more historians’ positions, explain the sources or assumptions behind those positions, and assess their strengths and weaknesses with reference to primary evidence. For source analysis (AO2 in the depth paper), attend to provenance, purpose and tone as well as content: ask who produced the source, why, for whom and whether it is representative or exceptional. Time management matters: for the breadth paper allow about one hour for the compulsory interpretations question and about 45 minutes for each essay; for source‑based depth questions aim to spend roughly an hour on the compulsory source question and plan 45 minutes for each essay. Use short, direct quotations from sources to support interpretation, but prioritise analysis in your own words. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions, annotate exemplar answers to learn how high marks are earned, and always end with a clear, balanced conclusion that weighs the evidence and answers the question directly.
