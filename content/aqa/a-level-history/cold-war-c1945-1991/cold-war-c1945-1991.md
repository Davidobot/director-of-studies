# The Cold War (c.1945–1991) (A-level History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction and structure of the period
The Cold War describes a prolonged period of political, military and ideological tension between the communist Soviet bloc and the capitalist Western alliance led by the United States. It is a global story of competition that stops short of full-scale conflict between the superpowers but shapes politics, diplomacy and societies from 1945 to 1991. For A-level study this period is best understood as a series of phases: the immediate post‑war settlement and the breakdown of Allied cooperation; the consolidation of rival blocs and the first major crises to 1963; a long phase of globalisation of conflict and attempts at détente through the 1960s and 1970s; and, finally, the late 1980s collapse of Soviet authority culminating in the peaceful revolutions of 1989–1991. Throughout the course the same themes recur: ideology and propaganda, alliance systems and spheres of influence, nuclear weapons and deterrence, economic capacity and reform, and the role of individuals and institutions in pushing events in particular directions.

## Origins: 1945–1949 — from alliance to antagonism
By 1945 the Grand Alliance of convenience that had defeated Nazi Germany was already fraying. Wartime conferences showed tensions over the fate of liberated and occupied countries, most visibly in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union sought friendly governments in its borderlands to provide security after the devastation of the Second World War; the United States and Britain increasingly feared Soviet expansion and the suppression of democratic pluralism. Policy responses hardened into doctrine: the Truman Doctrine (1947) framed containment of communism as US policy, and the Marshall Plan used economic aid to stabilise Western Europe and bind it to the West. The creation of Cominform and Soviet control over Eastern Europe, combined with Western initiatives for collective security, led to the formal division of Europe. The Berlin blockade of 1948–49 and the foundation of NATO in 1949 mark the moment when the Cold War became institutionalised as two rival blocs, each with its own military and political architecture.

## Consolidation and early hot conflicts: 1949–1963
The Cold War quickly became global. In East Asia the Chinese Communist victory in 1949 and the Korean War (1950–1953) showed how superpower rivalry could be fought by proxy and produce regional devastation without direct US–Soviet all‑out war. The Korean conflict also hardened American policy, encouraging rearmament and the global projection of force. The 1950s saw ideological competition in the Third World through economic support, covert action and proxy conflicts; decolonisation created new arenas in Asia, Africa and Latin America for superpower rivalry. The nuclear arms race escalated with both sides acquiring and improving thermonuclear weapons and delivery systems, producing the doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD). The 1956 Hungarian uprising and the Soviet response exposed limits to Western influence in satellite states, while the 1957 launch of Sputnik intensified fears about missile parity and technology. The Berlin question remained central: crises in 1958 and, most dramatically, the Berlin Wall crisis of 1961 emphasised the division of Germany and the risk of flashpoints. The apex of direct confrontation came in the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, where careful diplomacy averted nuclear war but underscored how close the world could come to catastrophe.

## Détente, escalation and globalisation of conflict: 1963–1979
After 1962 both superpowers sought ways to reduce direct nuclear risk even as competition continued elsewhere. The period from the mid‑1960s to the late 1970s is complex: it contains episodes of détente between Washington and Moscow, signalled by agreements such as the Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963) and later SALT talks, alongside intensified proxy warfare in Vietnam, Angola and Afghanistan. The United States’ deepening involvement in Vietnam and its domestic consequences—social protest, the credibility gap, and limits on presidential power—illustrate the domestic impacts of Cold War foreign policy. Détente brought strategic arms limitation talks and an easing of tensions for a time, but it was fragile. The Prague Spring of 1968 and its suppression reminded Europe of Soviet dominance; the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan shattered détente and led to renewed confrontation. Superpower competition also took economic and cultural forms: trade, aid, and the spread of political models became instruments of influence, and movements such as non‑alignment sought to carve independence from both blocs.

## The endgame: 1979–1991 — the Soviet crisis and peaceful revolutions
The final phase of the Cold War is dominated by the internal crisis of the Soviet system as much as by external pressures. The decade that followed the Afghanistan invasion exacerbated economic strain and political stagnation in the USSR. In 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary and introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to revive Soviet socialism. These policies, together with the high cost of arms competition and growing nationalisms in the Eastern bloc, set in motion centrifugal forces that the Soviet leadership could not control. A series of summits between Reagan and Gorbachev, combined with arms control agreements and a strategic shift in US policy, reduced direct confrontation. The moment of rupture came in 1989 when Eastern European satellite regimes collapsed one after another—Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania—largely through popular, often non‑violent, movements. German reunification in 1990 symbolised the end of the division of Europe. In December 1991 the Soviet Union formally dissolved, marking the end of the Cold War era. Key to understanding this ending is the interplay of reformist leadership, economic weakness, rising national movements, and changing Western strategies.

## Consequences, themes and interpretations
The Cold War reshaped the international order. Europe was divided for nearly half a century, but the conflict also stimulated rapid scientific and technological development and sustained large military‑industrial complexes. Decolonisation was accelerated and entangled with superpower politics, creating complex postcolonial states and conflicts. The nuclear balance created a new kind of deterrence politics where direct superpower war was avoided but proxy wars and crises were frequent. Interpretations of the Cold War’s origins and course are contested and useful for essays and historical investigation. Early orthodox views attribute primary responsibility to Soviet expansionism and ideological aggression; revisionist historians emphasised US economic and strategic interests and argued that American policy could be provocative. A later post‑revisionist synthesis locates causation in mutual misperceptions, security dilemmas and bipolar rivalry rather than sole blame. When studying the period, link political decisions to economic capacity, leadership personalities to institutional constraints, and international events to domestic contexts—these connections are central to strong A‑level answers.

## Exam technique
Successful A‑level answers combine precise factual knowledge with analytical structure and clear evaluation. For essays start with a brief introduction that defines the focus, places the question in chronological context and outlines your argument. Use topic sentences to structure paragraphs and ensure each paragraph advances your case with specific evidence—dates, key events, names and outcomes. Where sources are provided (Component 2 style questions), address provenance and context: who produced the source, for what audience, with what purpose, and how does that affect its reliability and utility? When tackling interpretations (Component 1 style questions or AO3 tasks), compare two or more historians’ views by explaining the historians’ arguments, assessing their evidence, relating them to the wider context and judging their relative persuasiveness. Always link evaluation back to the question and resist merely narrating events without analysis. Time management is crucial: for a 2 hour 30 minute paper allocate roughly 60 minutes to the compulsory source/interpretation question and about 45 minutes to each essay, leaving time to plan and proofread. In the Historical Investigation (NEA), choose a focused, manageable question with sufficient primary sources and historiographical debate; integrate AO1, AO2 and AO3 in your narrative and ensure you meet the word‑limit and the requirement to evaluate primary material and two academic interpretations. Finally, present a clear conclusion that answers the question directly and summarises why your judgements follow from the evidence you have considered.
