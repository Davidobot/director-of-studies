# Coastal landscapes in the UK (GCSE Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction to UK coasts and why they matter
The coastline of the United Kingdom is diverse and dynamic, ranging from steep, rocky cliffs and narrow wave-cut platforms to wide sandy beaches, extensive sand dune systems and complex estuaries. These coastal landscapes are shaped by the interaction of geology, waves, tides and human activity. For GCSE geography, the coast is an ideal place to explore physical processes and their impacts on people, as well as the choices that societies make about managing risk and conserving environments. Studying UK coasts helps you link processes such as erosion, transport and deposition to the landforms you can see on maps, photographs and in the field, and it provides clear case studies for questions on management, sustainability and conflicts between stakeholders.

## Coastal processes: the forces that shape the shoreline
Coastal landforms are created by a suite of processes operating over different timescales. Waves deliver energy to the shore and are generally described as constructive or destructive. Constructive waves are low, long and deposit sediment on the beach; destructive waves are higher and steeper, eroding the coast by powerful backwash. The main forms of coastal erosion are hydraulic action, where water forces air into cracks and weakens rock; abrasion, where material thrown against the cliff wears it away; attrition, where rock fragments collide and become smaller and smoother; and solution, where certain rock types such as chalk are dissolved by seawater. Weathering contributes to weakening cliff faces through mechanical processes like freeze–thaw and chemical processes such as solution and oxidation. Mass movement, including slumping, sliding and rockfalls, transports large volumes of material down a cliff and can be triggered by groundwater or undercutting from wave action.

Transport along the coast is dominated by longshore drift, the zig-zag movement of sediment along the shore driven by the prevailing wind and wave direction. Sediment is moved by traction, saltation, suspension and solution, and the places where energy falls below the threshold for transport are where deposition occurs. Sediment supply and transfer are often considered within sediment cells or littoral cells, lengths of coastline where inputs, outputs and movement of sediment are relatively self-contained. Human activities that alter sediment supply — such as river damming or the construction of coastal defenses — can change the balance of erosion and deposition along and beyond specific stretches of coast.

## Erosional landforms: cliffs, headlands and stacks
Where the coastline is composed of alternating bands of hard and soft rock, waves tend to erode the softer rock more rapidly, leaving the harder rock jutting out as headlands with bays between them. The destructive power of waves focuses on headlands where wave energy is concentrated, creating steep cliffs and eventually wave-cut platforms at the base. Over time, headlands develop cracks and caves as waves exploit weaknesses in the rock. Continued erosion can form natural arches when caves deepen and meet, and when the arch collapses the isolated remnants are stacks and, in time, stumps. Classic UK examples include the chalk and limestone features along parts of the south coast, where dramatic cliffs and stacks provide clear evidence of these processes.

The type and arrangement of rock are critical. Concordant coastlines, where rock layers run parallel to the shore, can create long stretches of similar cliffs but may have abrupt changes where harder rock ends. Discordant coastlines reveal alternating headlands and bays more clearly because bands of varying resistance are exposed to the same wave attack. When working from maps or photographs, linking rock type and structure to the position and shape of coastal features is an important analytical skill.

## Depositional landforms: beaches, spits, dunes and bars
Where wave energy falls and sediment is deposited, a range of depositional landforms can develop. Beaches are the most obvious, composed of sand, shingle or a mixture. The profile of a beach depends on the dominant wave type: constructive waves tend to build gentle, wide beaches while destructive waves produce steeper, narrower profiles. Sand dunes form where dry sand is blown inland from the beach and trapped by vegetation or obstacles; dune systems are important habitats and can provide a natural buffer against storm surges.

Spits are elongated ridges of sand or shingle attached at one end to the land, formed where longshore drift moves sediment around a bend in the coastline and deposition continues until a narrow landform projects into open water. Where a spit extends across a bay or river mouth and connects to the land on both sides, a bar may form, sometimes trapping a lagoon behind it. Salt marshes often develop in sheltered, low-energy areas behind spits or bars, and these environments are valuable for wildlife and for storm protection because they absorb wave energy.

UK examples show these landforms clearly: spits such as Spurn Head at the mouth of the Humber and Chesil Beach off the Dorset coast (a famous shingle tombolo that connects the Isle of Portland to the mainland) illustrate how transport and deposition can rework sediment into striking landforms.

## Sediment cells, human impacts and the Holderness case study
Understanding coastal change requires looking beyond single features to the wider sediment system. The concept of sediment cells divides the coast into sections where material is largely recycled within boundaries of headlands and offshore features. Within these cells, inputs from cliff erosion, river supply and offshore sources are balanced against outputs such as longshore drift losses offshore. When humans interrupt those supplies, for example by building dams that trap river sediment or by constructing coastal defenses that prevent natural erosion, the sediment budget changes and problems can be displaced down-drift.

The Holderness coast in eastern England is a classic illustration of rapid coastal retreat and the social choices that follow. Underlain largely by soft boulder clay, this coastline experiences some of the fastest erosion rates in Europe. Villages and farmland have been lost to the sea over the past century, and towns such as Hornsea and with smaller settlements like Mappleton have faced difficult decisions over defense. At Mappleton, significant hard engineering was installed to protect a main road and properties, stabilising that specific stretch but reducing sediment supply to beaches further south and potentially increasing erosion elsewhere. Holderness shows how geological vulnerability, wave climate from the North Sea and human management combine to shape erosion patterns and create conflicts over who and what to protect.

## Coastal management in the UK: strategies, trade-offs and examples
Coastal management ranges from hard engineering to soft, and from protection to acceptance. Hard engineering includes sea walls, rock armour and groynes; these structures can provide strong local protection and immediate reassurance to communities but are often expensive to build and maintain and can reflect wave energy, increasing erosion elsewhere. Soft engineering options, such as beach nourishment and dune regeneration, work with natural processes by adding or stabilising sediment and are generally seen as more sustainable, although they require ongoing maintenance and can be costly over time.

Managed realignment accepts that some areas are unsustainable to defend and deliberately allows the shoreline to move landward. This approach can create natural habitats, such as salt marshes, that absorb wave energy and store carbon. A notable UK example is the managed realignment at Medmerry in West Sussex, where a realignment scheme created valuable habitats while reducing flood risk for local communities. Small-scale local projects, such as beach nourishment at particular resort towns or the installation of timber groynes to protect a village frontage, show how management is often a compromise between environmental objectives and protecting homes, infrastructure and businesses.

The choice of strategy involves economic, social and environmental trade-offs and depends on factors such as the value of assets at risk, the rate of coastal change, the availability of funding and the views of different stakeholders. For exam answers, it is helpful to show understanding of short-term versus long-term costs, downstream impacts, and the need to consider wider coastal systems rather than treating stretches in isolation.

## Exam technique
When answering GCSE questions on coastal landscapes, always start by being clear about what the question asks. For “describe” questions, focus on clear, factual detail about features or processes; for “explain” questions, link cause and effect, showing the process that produces the feature. For “assess” or “evaluate” questions, balance the answer by considering different viewpoints and trade-offs, and conclude with a justified judgement. Use a named UK case study in your longer answers: give location, key physical reasons for the coastal change (for example rock type and wave exposure), evidence of impact (such as loss of land or community response) and the management chosen, with discussion of costs and benefits. Referencing specific processes — hydraulic action, abrasion, longshore drift, deposition — and linking them to features strengthens your explanation.

Diagrams and annotated sketches can score marks by making your answers clearer; practice drawing a labelled cross-section of a cliff and wave-cut platform, a sequence from cave to stack, or the plan view of a spit with a hooked end. When using numerical evidence, be precise about rates or outcomes if you have them, but avoid guessing statistics you are unsure of. For fieldwork-related questions, explain the methods you would use (for example beach profiles, pebble size sampling and measuring angle of incidence to show longshore drift), how the data would be presented and what it could reveal about coastal processes.

In extended answers, structure paragraphs so each one makes a single point that is supported by evidence or an example, followed by explanation. Manage your time in the exam by allocating more to questions with higher marks and always leave a short period to check spelling, punctuation and grammar, and to ensure specialist terms are used accurately. Finally, show that you can think like a geographer by connecting processes, places and people: describe the physical system, explain its consequences for the human environment, and evaluate the sustainability of the management options chosen.
