# Urban issues and challenges (GCSE Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## The global picture: urbanisation and megacities
Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of a country’s population comes to live in towns and cities. Over the last century the world has shifted from being mainly rural to mainly urban in population. This trend is strongest in newly emerging economies (NEEs) and lower income countries (LICs), where rapid migration to cities and high rates of natural increase have produced fast-growing towns and the emergence of megacities. A megacity is commonly defined as a metropolitan area with more than ten million inhabitants. These very large urban areas bring major economic opportunities, acting as centres of industry, services and innovation, but they also generate serious problems when growth is rapid and planning, investment and infrastructure lag behind. Understanding global patterns of urban change means recognising contrasts between higher income countries (HICs), where urban growth is often slower and ageing populations are common, and many LICs and NEEs where youth populations, rapid rural-to-urban migration and informal settlements are typical features.

## Why cities grow: natural increase and migration
Cities grow for two main reasons: natural increase and migration. Natural increase happens when birth rates exceed death rates and is often important where cities have large youthful populations. Migration is driven by push and pull factors. Push factors in rural areas include poor harvests, lack of services, low wages, and limited prospects. Pull factors that attract people to cities include the promise of jobs, better education and healthcare, and the perception of greater freedom and choice. The push–pull model helps to explain why people leave rural areas and why particular cities expand rapidly. Migration can be internal, from countryside to city, or international, from one country to another; both types reshape urban populations and cultures. Rapid growth caused by a combination of migration and natural increase creates pressure on housing, services and jobs, and can lead to the expansion of informal housing and unplanned suburbs.

## Opportunities created by urban growth in LICs and NEEs
Urban growth brings significant opportunities for individuals, regions and countries, particularly in LICs and NEEs where cities are often engines of economic change. Cities concentrate labour, markets and infrastructure; they can attract industry and foreign investment, provide a wide range of jobs and foster small-scale entrepreneurship. Social opportunities include better access to healthcare, education and public services compared with many rural areas. Urban environments also support cultural exchange and innovations in services. For national economies, successful cities can stimulate wider development by increasing productivity and creating demand for goods and services. At the same time, these benefits are not automatic: they depend on the city’s economic base, the quality of governance, and investment in infrastructure and services that allow growth to be inclusive rather than exclusive.

## Challenges for rapidly growing cities: slums, services and the environment
The flip side of rapid urban growth in LICs and NEEs is that it often creates major challenges. One of the clearest is housing. When demand outstrips supply, many migrants end up in informal settlements or slums where housing is insecure, overcrowded and lacks basic services such as clean water, sanitation and waste collection. Providing reliable water supply, sanitation, healthcare and education for rapidly increasing populations is one of the most urgent challenges. Economically, cities can struggle to provide enough formal employment, leading to high levels of underemployment and informal sector work. Social problems linked to rapid growth include poverty, inequality, poor public health and higher crime rates. Environmentally, fast urban expansion often increases air and water pollution, creates huge volumes of waste, and places pressure on nearby ecosystems. Traffic congestion and inadequate transport infrastructure further reduce quality of life and economic efficiency.

## Case study approach: a major city in an LIC or NEE
A case study of a major city in an LIC or NEE helps make these ideas concrete. When studying such a city, focus on three linked themes: causes of growth, the opportunities created, and the challenges that followed. Describe the city’s location and its importance on regional, national or international scales. Explain why it has grown: is growth driven by migration from rural areas, by natural increase, or by economic factors such as industrialisation and investment? Explore how growth has created opportunities such as improved access to services, new jobs and cultural vibrancy, but also detail challenges including slums or informal settlements, shortages of water and sanitation, congestion and pollution. Finally, evaluate responses to these challenges: how are local or national governments, NGOs and communities improving housing, providing basic services, reducing unemployment or managing waste? Examples of management include slum-upgrading programmes that legalise and improve housing and services, community water projects, provision of microfinance to support small businesses, and targeted education and health initiatives. Using named projects and concrete outcomes in your case study shows clear understanding of the interactions between social, economic and environmental factors.

## Urban change in the UK: opportunities, inequalities and regeneration
Urban change in the UK has followed different patterns to many LICs and NEEs, but it generates its own mixture of opportunities and problems. Major UK cities are national hubs for commerce, culture and transport, and many have diversified economies focused on services, finance, media and technology. National and international migration have contributed to cultural diversity and a dynamic labour market, but they also influence housing demand and the character of neighbourhoods. Urban change can produce positive social and economic outcomes such as expanded leisure, international cultural exchange and improved public transport systems. Conversely, deindustrialisation in some areas has left pockets of urban deprivation and long-term unemployment, creating spatial inequalities often conceptualised as the north–south divide. Urban regeneration projects have been used to tackle dereliction and stimulate new investment. Successful regeneration schemes typically combine housing renewal, creation of employment opportunities, transport improvements and environmental enhancements, and they often prioritise the reuse of brownfield sites rather than greenfield development. However, regeneration can also lead to gentrification, where rising property values push out long-term residents. Examining a UK city case study through these lenses—location, migration impacts, opportunities, challenges and a specific regeneration example—enables a balanced analysis of urban change.

## Planning, sustainability and transport in cities
Sustainable urban living aims to balance economic development, social needs and environmental protection. Cities can become more sustainable by conserving water and energy, improving waste recycling, and creating green spaces that enhance health and biodiversity. Transport management is a central part of making cities liveable: reducing traffic congestion and lowering emissions can be addressed through a mix of strategies including public transport improvements, promotion of walking and cycling, congestion charging, and investment in integrated transport systems that link buses, trains and trams. Policies to encourage energy-efficient buildings, decentralised renewable energy and better planning of land use reduce the environmental footprint of urban areas. For the urban poor, practical improvements such as safer water supplies, community waste collection schemes and accessible public transport can have immediate benefits. Sustainable urban planning also involves long-term thinking about climate resilience, flood risk management, and the preservation of green belts and peri-urban farmland to reduce sprawl.

## From the urban fringe to commuting and suburban growth
The edges of cities are dynamic zones where rural and urban pressures meet. Urban sprawl and the growth of commuter settlements change the rural–urban fringe, increasing demand for housing and infrastructure. Development on greenfield sites can reduce agricultural land and natural habitats, while brownfield redevelopment can provide opportunities to renew former industrial areas. The expansion of commuter belts changes travel patterns, often increasing reliance on car travel and contributing to congestion. Strategic planning is required to balance housing needs with environmental protection and to provide affordable transport for workers. Policies such as promoting higher-density housing near transport hubs, preserving greenbelts, and investing in rapid public transport help manage the impacts of suburban growth and reduce the social and ecological costs of sprawling development.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on urban issues and challenges, start by showing clear understanding of the command words. For “describe” questions give clear factual statements about patterns or features; for “explain” questions link causes and consequences using reasoned chains of explanation; for “evaluate” or “assess” questions present balanced arguments and reach a justified judgement. Always use named examples from your studied case studies to support points. For a 6 or 9 mark question structure answers using short paragraphs each focused on one idea: a clear point, explanation of how it works or why it matters, and the case study evidence that illustrates it. For longer extended prose answers aim to structure your response with a brief introduction that sets out the approach, several analytical paragraphs that explore causes, impacts and responses, and a concluding paragraph that evaluates and makes a judgement. Use precise geographical vocabulary—terms such as urbanisation, natural increase, push and pull factors, megacity, informal settlement, brownfield, greenfield, regeneration and sustainable urban development—to gain credit for specialist terminology and clarity. When using examples, include specific details about location, the scale of the issue and outcomes of management strategies. For questions that ask you to make decisions about management, consider social, economic and environmental consequences and weigh the trade-offs. Finally, pay attention to spelling, punctuation and grammar, and practise writing timed answers so that you can organise material effectively under exam conditions.
