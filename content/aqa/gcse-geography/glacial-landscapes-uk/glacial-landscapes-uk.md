# Glacial landscapes in the UK (GCSE Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: why glacial landscapes matter
Glacial landscapes are one of the most striking legacies of the Quaternary ice ages in the UK. Even though the ice retreated around 10 000 years ago, the shapes left behind — steep-walled corries, U-shaped valleys, ribbon lakes and hummocky moraine — still define much of the scenery of upland Britain. Learning about glacial landscapes helps you understand the processes that carved the land, the sediments that were left behind, and how people use and manage these environments today. For GCSE Geography you need to be able to explain the key processes of glaciation, recognise and describe the landforms produced by erosion, transportation and deposition, and use a UK case study to show the economic opportunities and management issues in a glaciated upland area.

## Ice in the British landscape: the last ice age and ice cover
During the last ice age, commonly called the Last Glacial Maximum (around 21 000 years ago), much of northern and western Britain was covered by the British–Irish Ice Sheet. Scotland and large parts of northern England and Wales were covered by ice, with ice lobes and valley glaciers extending into upland areas such as the Lake District, the Pennines and Snowdonia. Southern England was largely periglacial rather than ice-covered, with freezing and thawing of the ground shaping the landscape. The pattern of ice movement and the location of glacier fronts determined where erosion was strongest and where large volumes of sediment were deposited. Remember that ice did not act uniformly: valley glaciers carved deep troughs in upland areas, while ice sheets flowed more broadly across the landscape, smoothing some areas and depositing large amounts of till elsewhere.

## Glacial processes: weathering, movement and meltwater action
Glacial landscapes result from a combination of weathering, erosion, transportation and deposition. Freeze–thaw weathering is important in upland cold climates: water enters cracks in rock, freezes, expands and wedges the rock apart, producing loose fragments that glaciers can remove. Erosion by ice operates mainly through two processes. Abrasion occurs when rocks and sediment frozen into the base of the glacier grind against the bedrock, smoothing and polishing surfaces and producing fine rock flour. Plucking happens when meltwater penetrates joints in rock, refreezes and pulls blocks out as the glacier moves away; plucking creates steep back walls and jagged profiles. Glaciers move by internal deformation of the ice and by sliding at the base where meltwater lubricates the bed; rotational slip is a form of movement especially important in the hollow of a corrie, where the ice rotates as it moves outwards. Meltwater from glaciers is a powerful agent of transportation and deposition: as water flows away from the ice it sorts sediments by size, producing well-sorted outwash deposits, while material dropped directly from the ice is unsorted till. Bulldozing at the glacier snout pushes material into morainic ridges and other depositional forms.

## Landforms produced by glacial erosion
Glacial erosion produces a set of characteristic upland landforms that you must be able to describe and explain. Corries (also called cirques) are armchair-shaped hollows with steep back walls and a rock lip; they form where snow accumulates, compacts into ice and the rotating movement of a small glacier erodes the hollow by plucking and abrasion. When a corrie fills with water it forms a tarn. Where several corries form around a mountain summit, the ridges between them become very narrow and sharp; these knife-edged ridges are called arêtes. If three or more arêtes converge they can leave a steep, pointed peak known as a pyramidal peak, illustrated by classic mountain peaks in high mountain regions. In glaciated river valleys, the straight V-shaped valley of a river is transformed by glacier erosion into a broad, steep-sided U-shaped glacial trough; the valley floor is typically wide and flat or gently rounded. Truncated spurs are formed where valley sides and interlocking spurs are cut off by the passing glacier, leaving steep cliff-like ends. Hanging valleys occur where smaller tributary glaciers once joined a main glacier; the tributary valley is left 'hanging' above the main valley floor and often has a waterfall where the river now drops into the main trough. Ribbon lakes are long, narrow lakes that occupy deepened sections of a glacial trough where softer rock was more heavily eroded or where over-deepening by the glacier occurred.

## Landforms produced by glacial transportation and deposition
Deposits left by glaciers contrast with erosional features and are important in identifying former ice margins. Till (or glacial till) is unsorted material dropped directly from ice and can form hummocky ground, drumlins or ground moraine. Drumlins are streamlined, elongated hills of compacted till with a blunt end facing the direction the ice came from and a tapered tail indicating the direction of ice movement; groups of drumlins, or drumlin fields, are common in formerly glaciated lowlands. Erratics are large boulders dropped by glacial ice that often appear out of place because their rock type differs from the local bedrock; they are useful markers of ice transport paths. Moraines are accumulations of glacial debris: lateral moraines run along former valley sides, medial moraines form where two valley glaciers join and funnel their debris onto the glacier surface, terminal moraines mark the furthest advance of a glacier, and ground moraine is the more widespread thin layer of till left beneath retreating ice. Meltwater channels and outwash plains are formed by glacial meltwater; these deposits tend to be well-sorted with sand and gravel laid down by flowing water, unlike the mixed nature of till.

## Interpreting glacial features in maps and photographs
Recognising glacial features on maps, cross-sections and photographs is a key skill. On large-scale Ordnance Survey maps corries appear as steep closed contours with a small lake symbol or depression, while U-shaped valleys are shown by widely spaced contour lines on the valley floor and steep contours on the sides. Drumlins show up as a series of elongated oval contour patterns pointing in a consistent direction. Moraines may be indicated by hummocky contours or a line of small mounds and ridges at the valley mouth. In photographs, look for steep, polished rock surfaces and striations where abrasion has smoothed rock, for profound hollows with tarns (corries), for narrow jagged ridges (arêtes) and for long narrow lakes occupying valley floors. When you interpret map or photographic evidence in an exam, always comment on orientation (which way the slope faces), steepness using contour spacing, and any indications of past ice flow direction provided by landform alignment.

## Upland case study: the Lake District as a classic glaciated landscape
The Lake District in north-west England is one of the best UK examples to use for case-study questions on glaciation. Its high fells were sculpted by valley glaciers that created deep U-shaped valleys such as Borrowdale and long ribbon lakes including Windermere and Ullswater. Corries such as Red Tarn and tarns beneath peaks like Scafell Pike demonstrate classic corrie formation, while sharp ridges and arêtes are visible between adjacent corries. Depositional features include moraine deposits and patches of hummocky ground; erratics transported from different rock types can be found across the area. As a case study, the Lake District allows you to describe the glacial processes that formed these features, to identify the attractions for tourism — dramatic scenery, walking and climbing, lakes and cultural landscapes — and to discuss the economic uses and pressures on the landscape. The area supports sheep farming on the fells, forestry on selected slopes and some quarrying; tourism is a major employer but creates conflicts over footpath erosion, traffic congestion in narrow valleys, pressure on local housing and waste management.

## Economic uses and management of glaciated upland areas
Glaciated upland areas continue to support a mix of economic activities. Tourism is often the principal income source because visitors are attracted to the dramatic scenery and outdoor recreation opportunities. Farming, particularly sheep grazing, has shaped the upland landscape for centuries and remains important for local economies. Forestry and limited quarrying also occur, exploiting timber and mineral resources. These uses can conflict: intensive grazing may reduce biodiversity and hinder natural regeneration of woodland, while quarrying and increased visitor numbers can damage habitats and create visual and noise pollution. Managing these conflicts requires a combination of approaches. National parks and conservation organisations work to balance access and protection through measures such as footpath repair and hardening to reduce erosion, the creation of visitor centres and car parking strategies to limit traffic through sensitive areas, zoning of activities so that high-impact uses are concentrated away from vulnerable habitats, and education and interpretation to encourage responsible visitor behaviour. Sustainable management may also include supporting traditional farming practices that maintain open habitats valued by many species, controlling invasive species and using planning policies to limit inappropriate development.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on glacial landscapes, start by reading the question carefully and underline command words such as 'describe', 'explain', 'suggest' or 'assess' so you know whether to focus on description, process, causes, or evaluation. For short-answer questions, use key terms accurately: name the process (for example, plucking or abrasion), describe what happens (water freezes, expands, rock is removed), and give an effect (steep corrie wall, polished rock). For medium-length answers, structure paragraphs so each one makes a clear point, supports it with an example or evidence (for instance, Windermere as a ribbon lake), and explains why it matters. For extended questions, plan a short introduction that sets out your argument, develop several linked paragraphs with both physical processes and human examples, and finish with a concluding judgement that answers the question directly. When interpreting maps or photographs, begin by orientating the evidence: note directions, scale and contour patterns, then identify specific features and explain how they indicate glacial activity (for example, widely spaced valley-floor contours versus steep side contours indicate a U-shaped valley). If a question asks for management or evaluation, balance the positive and negative impacts and justify any recommendation with evidence and consideration of stakeholders. Finally, use specialist terminology throughout, check spelling and punctuation where possible, and remember that examiners reward clear, linked explanations that show you understand both processes and real-world examples.
