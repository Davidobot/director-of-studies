# Resource management: food, water and energy (GCSE Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview
Resource management is about ensuring that the food we eat, the water we use and the energy that powers our lives are available, affordable and sustainable now and in the future. At GCSE level you will explore global patterns of supply and demand, the causes and consequences of shortages and surpluses, and the strategies used to increase provision and move towards sustainability. The topic asks you to think at a range of scales: local schemes that change a village or city, national policies that reshape a country’s resource mix, and international projects and markets that create winners and losers. Case studies are essential: they let you illustrate concepts such as food security, water stress and energy mix with real examples, and they also help you show how responses differ between higher income countries (HICs), newly emerging economies (NEEs) and lower income countries (LICs).

## Why these resources matter
Food, water and energy are deeply connected to economic development and quality of life. Food is needed for health and labour productivity; water is required for drinking, sanitation, agriculture and industry; energy drives transport, manufacturing and heating. Inequalities in access to these resources help explain global differences in wealth, health and stability. For example, areas of water surplus and deficit are mapped across the world and often coincide with regions of low or high agricultural output, while countries with limited domestic energy reserves may depend on imports and be vulnerable to price changes or political disruptions. Managing resources well reduces risk, supports economic growth and protects environments; mismanagement or scarcity can lead to famine, conflict, environmental damage and migration.

## Food: patterns, problems and solutions
Global food demand has risen because of population growth and rising incomes, which change diets and increase consumption of meat and processed foods. Patterns of calorie intake and food supply show clear inequalities: some regions have surpluses and waste, others face chronic undernutrition. Factors affecting supply include climate (temperature and rainfall), technology (mechanisation, fertilisers), water availability, pests and disease, conflict and poverty. Food insecurity produces clear social and economic impacts: famine and undernutrition damage health and development, while soil erosion and unsustainable practices degrade land for future production.

Strategies to increase food supply range from large-scale agricultural intensification to local, low-impact solutions. The Green Revolution is a classic example of how improved crop varieties, irrigation and inputs increased yields in countries such as India, transforming national food security but also creating environmental costs like groundwater depletion and increased pesticide use. Modern approaches include greenhouse production, hydroponics and aeroponics that grow crops with reduced soil and water use, and biotechnology that aims to increase yields or resistance to pests. Moving towards sustainability involves measures such as organic farming, permaculture, urban agriculture and reducing food waste. Urban farming in Havana after the 1990s is often cited as a successful local response: vacant urban land was converted to intensive vegetable plots, improving local food availability. When you use case studies, be ready to assess both benefits (higher yields, income, employment) and drawbacks (environmental impacts, social inequality, dependence on imports or technology).

## Water: availability, conflict and management
Water security is increasingly important. Global patterns show clear areas of surplus and deficit. The main drivers of rising demand are population growth, urbanisation and economic development; irrigation for agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater in most countries. Factors that limit availability include climate variability, geology, pollution, over-abstraction and limited infrastructure. Water insecurity can cause waterborne disease, reduce food production and industrial output, and in extreme cases contribute to local or regional conflicts.

Responses to water scarcity include building storage and transfer schemes, desalination, improved irrigation techniques and demand management. Large-scale transfers, such as China’s South–North Water Transfer Project, aim to move water from wetter regions to drier, industrialised north China. Such projects can bring major economic benefits but also involve huge financial cost, environmental disruption and social displacement. Desalination provides a reliable supply for water-poor but wealthy states in the Middle East, though it is energy intensive and raises environmental concerns. Sustainable measures focus on conservation: efficient irrigation (drip systems), groundwater recharge, rainwater harvesting and recycling greywater. In Bangladesh, rainwater harvesting and small-scale rooftop collection are common local adaptations that reduce dependence on distant supplies. When presenting examples, explain the trade-offs between short-term gains and long-term environmental or social costs.

## Energy: demand, security and the shift to renewables
Energy demand has grown with population, industrialisation and technology. The global distribution of energy consumption and supply is unequal: HICs historically consumed the most, but NEEs have rising demands as manufacturing and transport expand. Energy supply depends on physical resources (coal, oil, gas, uranium, wind, sunlight), technology, cost and politics. Reliance on fossil fuels has supported economic growth but created environmental and security challenges, including greenhouse gas emissions and vulnerability to volatile markets.

Strategies to increase energy supply include continuing to exploit fossil fuels and developing renewables and nuclear. Extraction of fossil fuels can bring rapid revenue and jobs, as with North Sea oil and gas for the UK, but also brings environmental damage and future economic risk if resources decline or prices fall. The Niger Delta illustrates how oil extraction can cause long-term community and environmental harm if not properly managed. Renewables offer lower-carbon alternatives: wind, solar, hydro, tidal and biomass each have different suitability by location. In LICs and NEEs, local renewable schemes are often effective: solar home systems and microgrids in Bangladesh and parts of Africa provide electricity to remote communities and support education and small businesses. Energy conservation and efficiency—improved building design, more efficient transport and appliances—are vital to reduce demand and carbon footprints. When you discuss energy, contrast reliability, cost, environmental impact and social consequences of different sources.

## Interconnections and the UK context
Food, water and energy are interdependent. Agriculture needs water and energy for irrigation, machinery and fertiliser production. Water supply often needs energy for pumping, treatment and distribution. Energy production can require water (cooling in thermal power stations) and land (for wind farms or bioenergy). Climate change influences all three: altered rainfall patterns threaten water and food supplies, while changes in river flow can affect hydroelectricity and irrigation.

In the UK context, demand patterns are changing. The food sector sees growing interest in year-round imports, seasonal produce and local sourcing to reduce food miles and carbon emissions, while agribusiness has become more prominent. Water management in the UK focuses on matching supply to demand across regions, reducing pollution and preparing for extremes—periods of drought and intense rainfall are both relevant. Major debates include whether to invest in more reservoirs, water transfers or demand reduction measures such as leakage control and smart metering. The UK energy mix has shifted markedly in recent decades: coal use has fallen, gas and renewables have risen, and there is a national move towards low-carbon electricity generation. Examples such as the decline of UK coal-fired power stations, growth of offshore wind, and development of North Sea gas and oil help illustrate the economic, environmental and social consequences of changing supplies.

## Case studies and how to use them
Choose a small set of well-understood case studies that cover different scales and contexts: a large-scale intervention, a national change, and a local sustainable scheme. For food, you might use the Green Revolution in India as a national example and urban agriculture in Havana as a local sustainable response. For water, China’s South–North Water Transfer is an example of a mega-project, while rainwater harvesting in Bangladesh is an effective local adaptation. For energy, North Sea oil and gas can illustrate fossil fuel extraction in a HIC context and solar microgrids or Bangladeshi solar home systems can show renewable solutions in LICs/NEEs. When you revise each case study, make sure you can explain the causes that led to the intervention, the social, economic and environmental impacts, who benefitted and who lost out, and how the scheme contributes (or does not contribute) to sustainability. Practise writing balanced evaluations that weigh advantages against disadvantages, and always link to the wider geographical themes of development, interdependence and sustainability.

## Exam technique
In exams start by quickly noting which case studies and local fieldwork examples you will use so you can apply them to different questions. For AO1 answers give precise definitions (for example: food security means regular access to enough safe and nutritious food), name places, and describe patterns. For AO2 show understanding by explaining processes and relationships—link climate, technology and population to changes in supply. For AO3 use evidence to interpret graphs, maps or resource material and make justified judgements; when a question asks you to evaluate, present balanced arguments and end with a clear, reasoned conclusion. For AO4 demonstrate geographical skills: reference scales, use data accurately and, where appropriate, interpret pre-release resources or fieldwork findings. In practice, structure longer responses by briefly defining terms, describing the situation with a named example, analysing causes and consequences, considering alternative viewpoints and management options, and finishing with a judgement. Always tailor your answer to the command words: “describe” needs detail and sequences, “explain” asks for causes and links, “assess” requires weighing evidence. Manage your time so you have enough space for SPaG and an overall conclusion for extended questions; quality of explanation and use of exemplification often wins higher marks rather than long general statements.
