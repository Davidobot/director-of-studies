# Weather hazards & tropical storms (GCSE Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Global atmospheric circulation and why it matters for weather hazards
Weather and climate patterns across the Earth are driven by global atmospheric circulation: a system of large-scale air movements that distribute heat from the equator towards the poles. Warm air rises at the equator, creating a low-pressure belt, and moves polewards in the upper atmosphere. As it cools it sinks around 30° latitude, producing high-pressure belts. Between these cells are the Ferrel and Polar cells, and associated surface wind systems such as the trade winds and the westerlies. These pressure belts and surface winds shape the typical locations of weather types across the planet and explain why some regions are prone to particular hazards. For example, the convergence of warm, moist trade winds in the tropics is a key ingredient for the formation of tropical storms, while mid-latitude westerlies steer depressions and frontal systems that bring stormy weather to the UK and other temperate regions. Understanding circulation helps explain the seasonal movement of hazards and why certain parts of the world are more exposed to intense storms, heavy rainfall or prolonged dry spells.

## Where and how tropical storms form
Tropical storms — known as hurricanes in the Atlantic, cyclones in the Indian Ocean, and typhoons in the western Pacific — develop over warm tropical oceans when several physical conditions align. Sea surface temperatures of at least about 26.5°C, a deep layer of warm water, and high humidity in the lower to mid-troposphere provide the energy and moisture needed. Weak vertical wind shear is also important, because strong changes in wind speed or direction with height disrupt the storm’s vertical structure. The sequence typically begins with an area of low pressure and organised thunderstorms. Convergence of winds near the surface forces warm, moist air to rise; as this air cools, water vapour condenses releasing latent heat, which further warms the air and lowers surface pressure, intensifying the updraught and drawing in more moisture. A self-reinforcing cycle develops, often forming a central calm eye surrounded by the most intense winds and rain in the eyewall, with spiral rainbands extending outward. The Coriolis effect gives the system its rotation and means tropical storms cannot form within about 5° of the equator.

## Structure and features of a tropical storm
A mature tropical storm has a characteristic structure that can be sketched in a cross-section or plan. At the centre is the eye, a relatively calm and clear area with low pressure. Surrounding the eye is the eyewall, a ring of the strongest winds and heaviest rainfall where the most severe damage occurs. Spiral rainbands radiate from the eyewall and contain thunderstorms that produce intense showers and gusty winds. At the surface, the storm may cover hundreds of kilometres and move along a track dictated by larger-scale wind patterns. Storm surge — an abnormal rise in sea level caused by the storm’s low pressure and strong onshore winds — is commonly the greatest risk to coastal areas, especially where the surge coincides with high tides.

## Distribution, seasonality and links to the circulation system
Tropical storms occur in belts roughly between 5° and 30° latitude in all ocean basins, although their frequency varies by region and season. The timing relates to when sea surface temperatures and atmospheric conditions are most favourable: for example, the Atlantic hurricane season peaks in late summer and early autumn because the ocean has absorbed heat through the summer months. The storms’ tracks are influenced by the subtropical high-pressure belts, trade winds and the mid-latitude westerlies; these steering currents explain why some storms recur in certain basins and why others curve away from coastlines or recurve into higher latitudes.

## Effects of tropical storms and the difference between primary and secondary impacts
Tropical storms create a mixture of direct (primary) and indirect (secondary) effects that can be immediate and long-lasting. Primary effects include strong winds that can destroy buildings, uproot trees and damage infrastructure, intense rainfall leading to flash flooding, and storm surges that inundate coastal areas. Secondary effects follow from these: prolonged disruption to electricity and water supplies, spread of waterborne disease due to contaminated water, loss of crops and livelihoods leading to food shortages, long-term economic losses from damaged infrastructure and reduced tourism, and mass displacement of people. The scale of effects often depends on local factors such as population density, quality of housing, coastal defences and emergency preparation. For example, Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in the Philippines in 2013 produced a catastrophic storm surge and wind damage that led to thousands of deaths, widespread destruction of housing and long-term disruption of livelihoods; its rapid impacts were compounded by poverty, poor housing and limited emergency infrastructure in some affected areas. By contrast, when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, advanced warning systems and monitoring were in place, but levee failures, social inequalities and delayed responses led to severe secondary impacts and human suffering, showing that both wealth and governance influence outcomes.

## Monitoring, prediction, protection and planning: reducing risk
Reducing the risks posed by tropical storms relies on a combination of monitoring and prediction systems, engineering protection and community planning. Satellites, ocean buoys and aircraft reconnaissance provide data on storm development and intensity while numerical weather prediction models are used to forecast tracks and potential impacts. Effective monitoring allows authorities to issue timely warnings and coordinate evacuations. Protection measures range from hard engineering such as sea walls and storm surge barriers to nature-based approaches like restoring mangroves and coastal wetlands, which can dissipate wave energy and reduce erosion. Planning measures include land-use regulation to prevent development in high-risk zones, building codes designed to withstand high winds, emergency shelters, public education about evacuation routes, and disaster response preparedness. Long-term recovery strategies may involve rebuilding more resilient infrastructure and diversifying local economies to reduce dependence on vulnerable sectors.

## Climate change and tropical storms: what might change?
Climate change is expected to influence tropical storms in several ways, though not all aspects are certain. Warmer sea surface temperatures increase the potential energy available to storms, making it plausible that the intensity of the strongest storms will increase, producing more category 4 and 5 events. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, so storms are likely to generate heavier rainfall and greater flooding. Sea-level rise, caused by thermal expansion and melting ice, increases baseline coastal water levels and therefore magnifies the impact of storm surge. There is some evidence that the overall global frequency of tropical storms may not rise and could even decline in certain basins, but a shift toward fewer storms that are, on average, more intense is a plausible outcome. For UK and other mid-latitude regions, the combination of more intense storms and higher sea levels increases coastal flood risk, and planning must consider these compound effects.

## The UK and other weather hazards: local context and recent trends
Although the UK does not experience tropical storms forming in its waters, it is affected by a range of weather hazards related to mid-latitude atmospheric systems and climate variability. Storms driven by the North Atlantic westerlies bring heavy rainfall and strong winds, which can cause river flooding, coastal erosion and transport disruption. Heatwaves driven by prolonged high-pressure systems bring public health challenges, particularly for vulnerable groups. Recent decades have seen a trend towards more extreme weather in the UK, with heavier winter rainfall events and record-breaking temperatures in summer becoming more common. Examples such as the winter floods in northern England and storm-related damage to infrastructure illustrate how extreme weather affects homes, businesses and ecosystems. Management strategies in the UK include investment in flood defences, improved forecasting and warning systems, sustainable drainage schemes, and planning policies that avoid the most vulnerable areas. Learning from past events and embedding resilience into urban planning and rural land management are essential steps to reduce future risk.

## Exam technique
To succeed in GCSE exam questions on weather hazards and tropical storms you must combine clear factual knowledge with case study detail and evaluation. When a question asks you to describe, focus on clear, specific statements about processes or features and use correct terminology such as "eyewall", "storm surge", "latent heat" and "trade winds". When asked to explain causes or impacts, go beyond description and show the sequence or mechanism: explain how warm sea surface temperatures lead to rising air, condensation and latent heat release, and how this intensifies winds and lowers pressure. Always use a named case study when required: give the name, location, date and key primary and secondary effects, then outline immediate and long-term responses. For higher-mark answers, make comparative or evaluative points, for example contrasting preparedness and recovery in different countries, or weighing the effectiveness of engineering solutions against ecosystem-based approaches. In extended answers, structure your writing so each paragraph makes a point supported by evidence and links back to the question. Practice drawing and labelling the structure of a tropical storm and annotating maps to show typical tracks and hazard-prone zones. Remember that SPaG is assessed, so write clearly, use specialist terms correctly and check your spelling and punctuation. Finally, practice past-paper questions under timed conditions and use examiner feedback to improve how you select relevant detail, build explanations and make reasoned judgements about management options.
