# Climate change (GCSE Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What is climate change and why it matters
Climate change describes a long-term shift in average weather patterns, such as temperature and rainfall, when these shifts are measured over decades or longer. It is different from day-to-day weather: weather is what happens today or this week, while climate is the long-term pattern. Since the start of the industrial era the Earth's climate has been changing in ways that are now measurable and, in many cases, unprecedented in human history. The topic matters because climate controls where people live, what crops can be grown, how water is supplied and how ecosystems function. Small changes in average conditions can produce large effects through increased frequency and intensity of extreme events, sea level rise and changing patterns of drought and flood. For GCSE Geography you should be able to explain both the physical processes involved and the consequences for people and the environment at local, national and global scales.

## Evidence for climate change
Evidence for climate change comes from many independent sources and from across long time-scales. Ice cores drilled through Antarctic and Greenland ice show atmospheric composition and temperature going back hundreds of thousands of years: bubbles trapped in the ice preserve samples of past air and demonstrate that concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane are now higher than during any comparable period in the Quaternary. Tree rings, pollen records and lake sediments extend the picture of past climates at regional scales. Instrumental records, which are direct measurements from thermometers and sea level gauges, show a clear warming trend over the last 150 years and rising global mean sea level due to thermal expansion of the oceans and melting land ice. Satellite measurements over recent decades add precise data on temperature, ice extent and sea surface temperatures. The continuous upward trend in atmospheric CO2 measured since the 1950s (often shown as the Keeling Curve) provides a direct modern record linking human activities to changing greenhouse gas concentrations.

## Natural and human causes of climate change
Climate changes for natural reasons as well as because of human activities. Natural factors include variations in Earth’s orbit and tilt (the Milankovitch cycles) that change how solar energy is distributed across the planet and have driven ice ages and interglacial periods; volcanic eruptions that can inject particles and sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere and cause short-term cooling by reflecting sunlight; and small changes in solar output. These natural drivers operate over a range of timescales and are an important part of the long-term climate record.

Human activities have become the dominant driver of global warming since the mid-19th century. The greenhouse effect is a natural process by which greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap some outgoing long-wave radiation and keep the planet warm enough for life. Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas for energy and transport increases atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Agriculture and land-use change, including deforestation and the draining of peatlands, add methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), both powerful greenhouse gases. Industry produces fluorinated gases with very high warming potential. Because these gases have increased rapidly in concentration, they enhance the natural greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and driving global temperature rise.

## Impacts on people and the environment
The effects of climate change are diverse and widespread, affecting physical systems, ecosystems and human societies. Rising global temperatures are linked to the melting of mountain glaciers and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, contributing to global sea level rise. Higher sea levels increase the risk of coastal flooding and erosion, threatening low-lying islands, coastal settlements and infrastructure. Ocean warming and acidification, the result of CO2 dissolving into seawater, harm marine life and reduce fishery yields; coral reefs are particularly vulnerable, suffering bleaching when temperatures rise.

Climate change also affects weather systems. Warmer air holds more moisture, so heavy rainfall and flash flooding become more likely in many regions while other areas face prolonged droughts. Changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms and heatwaves can damage property, reduce agricultural yields, and increase health risks from heat stress and from the spread of vector-borne diseases. For people, impacts include threats to food and water security, increased risk of displacement and migration from vulnerable coastal or drought-prone regions, economic losses from damaged infrastructure, and unequal effects because poorer communities and countries often have less capacity to adapt. Biodiversity is affected as species ranges shift, habitats are altered and some ecosystems, such as Arctic tundra and tropical montane forests, are under particular pressure.

## Mitigation: reducing the causes of climate change
Mitigation means taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, aiming to limit the magnitude of future climate change. Energy systems are central to mitigation because most emissions come from burning fossil fuels. Transitioning to low-carbon energy sources—wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and some forms of biomass—reduces emissions from electricity and heat. Improving energy efficiency in buildings, industry and transport lowers demand. Transport policy can encourage public transport, walking, cycling and low-emission vehicles. In land use, planting trees (afforestation and reforestation), restoring peatlands and protecting existing forests store carbon and reduce emissions from deforestation. Technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) can capture CO2 from power stations or industrial processes and store it underground, although it is still developing and expensive. Policy tools, including carbon pricing, emissions trading, regulations and subsidies, shape incentives for mitigation at national and international levels. For examination answers, it is important to give named examples of mitigation measures and to explain both benefits and limitations; for instance, solar and wind are low carbon but depend on available space, investment and grid upgrades, while afforestation may compete with food production if not carefully planned.

## Adaptation: coping with the consequences
Adaptation involves adjusting natural or human systems to reduce harm from climate impacts that are already occurring or are unavoidable. In coastal areas adaptation ranges from hard engineering such as sea walls to soft approaches like managed realignment where the coastline is allowed to move naturally in some places to create new habitats and buffer zones. Urban areas adapt by improving drainage and creating green spaces to reduce flood risk and urban heat island effects. Agriculture adapts through changes in crop varieties, planting dates, irrigation practices and soil management to cope with altered rainfall and temperature patterns. Water resource management becomes crucial in areas where demand rises and supply is variable; this may include improving storage, reducing leakage, recycling water and promoting water-saving technology. Health systems prepare for heatwaves and changing disease patterns by improving early-warning systems and emergency preparedness. Adaptation often has costs and trade-offs: expensive engineering works may protect wealthy urban locations while poorer rural communities remain vulnerable. Effective adaptation planning combines local knowledge with scientific projections, and includes measures that also deliver social and environmental co-benefits.

## International responses and the challenge of equity
Responding to climate change requires international cooperation because greenhouse gases mix globally in the atmosphere. Global agreements set collective goals and frameworks for action. The Paris Agreement represents the current global approach in which countries set their own national pledges—Nationally Determined Contributions—to limit warming and to report progress. Equity is central to climate negotiations because historically high-emitting countries have contributed most to the problem while many low-income countries suffer the worst impacts. This raises questions about finance for adaptation and mitigation, technology transfer, and liability for loss and damage. Examples of international support include funds and programmes to help developing countries adapt, to build renewable energy capacity and to protect forests. When writing answers, you should be able to discuss how responsibilities and capabilities differ between higher income countries (HICs) and lower income countries (LICs), and why this matters for global agreements and practical action.

## Case studies and examples to use in answers
Good answers use named case studies that illustrate causes, impacts, mitigation and adaptation. For a UK-focused example, the Thames Barrier and broader flood management strategies on the Thames illustrate adaptation to sea-level rise and river flooding in a high-income context. Internationally, Bangladesh is a strong example of vulnerability and adaptation: much of the country is low-lying and densely populated, so it faces regular flooding and cyclone impacts; community-based adaptation, improved cyclone shelters and early warning systems are important responses. For mitigation and land-use change, the Amazon rainforest provides an example of how deforestation contributes to emissions and biodiversity loss, and how international pressure, national policy and local livelihoods interact. For extreme events linked to warming tropical seas, Hurricane (Typhoon) Haiyan in 2013 shows the devastating human impacts of very intense storms in a vulnerable area. Choose two or three well-learned case studies—ideally one from a HIC and one from an LIC or NEE—and be ready to use them in answers that ask you to compare effects, responses and the role of wealth and governance.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about climate change, start by noting the command word and the assessment objective it targets. For AO1 (knowledge) use precise definitions and name relevant processes or gases; for AO2 (understanding) explain how processes are linked; for AO3 (application and evaluation) apply your case study knowledge to the question and weigh up options; for AO4 (skills) use any provided figures or maps and make clear judgements. In extended responses, structure your answer clearly: begin with a brief definition or context sentence, then develop points with specific evidence or examples, explain the consequences or mechanisms, and end with a short conclusion or evaluation. For “describe” questions focus on clear factual statements and named examples, while “explain” questions require causes and processes. For “assess” or “evaluate” questions present balanced arguments that consider advantages and disadvantages, costs, feasibility and equity, and conclude by justifying a recommendation. Always use at least one named case study where asked and link physical and human geography in your discussion. Remember the requirement for SPaG marks: write clearly, use specialist terms such as greenhouse gases, mitigation, adaptation and sea level rise correctly, and check spelling and punctuation. If a resource booklet is provided (Paper 3), spend time extracting key data and use it to support your judgement, but avoid merely repeating the source—interpret it and relate it to your knowledge. Finally, plan your time so you can answer all parts of a question fully and check the marks available to match the depth of response required.
