# Fieldwork and geographical skills (GCSE Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: why fieldwork and skills matter
Fieldwork and geographical skills are central to GCSE Geography because they turn the classroom into a place for discovery and make theory testable against real places. AQA’s specification expects students to collect, present, analyse and evaluate primary data gathered outdoors on at least two occasions in contrasting environments, and to develop cartographic, graphical, numerical and statistical skills that are examined across all three papers. Fieldwork is not an optional extra; it is how you learn to ask geographical questions, choose appropriate methods, use real data to test ideas and weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of decisions about people and the environment. Approaching fieldwork well gives you confidence in the exams: examiners expect clear use of evidence, well-reasoned conclusions and thoughtful evaluation, all underpinned by accurate skills such as grid referencing, graph construction and statistical summary.

## Planning fieldwork: questions, context and safety
A strong enquiry begins with a focussed question or hypothesis that links clearly to the specification content. Choose questions that are manageable within the time and resources available and that make the most of the location: for a coastal day ask about erosion or sediment size and transport, for a river visit investigate channel shape, discharge or flood risk, for an urban study explore land use, pedestrian flows or air quality. Your planning should include the geographical theory that underpins the enquiry, the sources of primary and secondary data you will use, the sampling strategy you will adopt and a simple timetable for the day. Safety and logistics are essential parts of planning. Fieldwork must take place outside the classroom and school grounds, and the centre must keep a written statement recording dates, locations, numbers of students, main questions explored and links to the specification; this must be signed by the Head of Centre. Consider risk assessments for both human and physical hazards, obtain permissions where needed, plan first aid and communication, and ensure students understand consent and ethical issues with questionnaires or interviews.

## Data collection and sampling methods
Collecting high-quality primary data requires suitable methods and consistent technique. For physical enquiries you might measure pebble size with a calliper, record beach profiles with a clinometer and tape, or measure stream velocity and use that with cross-sectional area to estimate discharge. For human enquiries you could use timed traffic counts, pedestrian surveys, land-use transects or questionnaires designed to avoid leading questions. Sampling must be thought through: random sampling reduces bias but may be impractical; systematic sampling using regular intervals along a transect reveals change with distance; stratified sampling catches variation across different land-use types or habitats. Recording procedures should be standardised and practised before the trip so that measurements are comparable. Always record the method in full: how many readings, the exact location (use four- or six-figure grid references), time of day and any environmental conditions that could influence results. Photographs and sketches are valuable qualitative data that help to illustrate conditions and support interpretation.

## Presenting and processing fieldwork data
Presentation turns raw measurements into readable evidence. Choose graphical and cartographic forms that best show what you want to say: line graphs for change over time or downstream change, scattergraphs to test relationships between two variables such as pebble size and distance from the cliff, bar charts to compare categories, histograms for frequency distributions of grain size and proportional symbol or flow maps for movement. At GCSE you are expected to construct graphs with appropriate scales, label axes clearly and plot data accurately. Map skills include drawing reliable transects and sketch maps, annotating OS extracts and using scale to measure distances. Processing often requires simple calculations: averages (mean, median and mode) to summarise central tendency, range and interquartile range to describe spread, percentage change to compare before-and-after situations, and basic cumulative frequency where appropriate. Presentation should also include clear annotation: highlight key patterns and anomalies and, where possible, link features on your graphs to features observed on site or in photographs.

## Analysing data, drawing conclusions and evaluation
Analysis is more than description; it is explanation and judgement. When you describe results begin by summarising the main trends and then explain them by linking to geographical theory, processes and place-specific evidence. For instance, a downstream increase in channel width can be explained by higher discharge and greater lateral erosion, supported by measurements and a suitable cross-section. Use statistical ideas to strengthen arguments: where two variables appear related, a trend line on a scattergraph and a discussion of correlation (not necessarily causation) adds rigour. Anomalous results should be identified and accounted for: were they caused by human error, localised conditions or real variation? Conclusions must be clearly tied to the original aims or hypothesis and based on the evidence you collected, indicating how confident you are in your findings. Evaluation should honestly assess the reliability, accuracy and validity of the enquiry and propose realistic improvements. Consider sample size, precision of instruments, time constraints, observer bias and the extent to which findings can be generalised. Good evaluation is specific: suggest precise changes such as increasing sample points, using more accurate measuring equipment, changing sampling strategy or conducting repeated visits across seasons.

## Cartographic, graphical, numerical and statistical skills
The specification requires competence across a wide range of skills. Cartographically, you should be comfortable with latitude and longitude, four-figure and six-figure grid references, interpreting contours and gradients, measuring distances on maps using scale, and drawing cross-sections to relate relief to map evidence. You must be able to recognise map symbols and infer land use, settlement patterns and transport networks from OS extracts and thematic maps. Graphical skills include selecting the correct graph type, constructing histograms with equal class intervals, completing and interpreting choropleth and isoline maps, plotting scattergraphs with trend lines and reading population pyramids. Numeracy skills demand understanding units, ratios and proportions and designing data sheets that capture accurate measurements. Statistically, you are expected to calculate measures of central tendency and spread such as mean, median, mode, range and interquartile range, to calculate percentage increases or decreases and to interpret bivariate data with trend lines and predictions. Use qualitative data alongside quantitative measures to enrich interpretation: interviews, photographs and field sketches provide context and can explain patterns found in numbers.

## Use of technology and secondary sources: GIS and the pre-release materials
Modern geography rarely relies on fieldwork alone. Geographic Information Systems (GIS), satellite imagery and remote sensing are useful secondary sources that allow you to analyse spatial patterns at different scales and to combine layers of information, such as land use, slope and flood risk. Becoming familiar with basic GIS visualisations, how to read satellite images and how to spot changes between historical and current imagery will improve your ability to interpret unfamiliar sources in exams. Paper 3 requires students to work with a pre-release resources booklet made available twelve weeks before the exam; you will be given a clean copy in the exam room. Use the pre-release time wisely: practise interpreting the sources, identify the stakeholders and possible conflicts, and sketch a plan for the evaluative question. The issue evaluation tasks draw on both fieldwork experience and secondary evidence, so practice integrating both types of data in a coherent argument that considers social, economic and environmental impacts.

## Communicating fieldwork: the individual enquiry write-up
When you present your own fieldwork enquiry in the exam or in coursework-style tasks, structure matters. A clear title and an aim that links to geographical theory set the scene, followed by a concise explanation of the hypotheses or questions. Describe the study area and give precise locations using coordinates or grid references. Methods should be detailed enough for another student to replicate the enquiry; include sampling strategy, number of readings and instruments used. Present results with well-labelled graphs, tables and maps, then interpret them by linking patterns to process and place. Conclude by answering the original question and evaluating the methods. Effective write-ups use specialist geographical vocabulary, clear paragraphs and accurate Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPaG), because exam marks reward precise communication as well as correct content.

## Exam technique
In the exam read the question paper carefully and use time wisely. For questions based on fieldwork or unseen sources, start by examining any maps, graphs or extracts for obvious patterns and jot down quick notes on possible explanations and relevant specification content. When writing extended answers, organise your response: a short introduction to set the context, clear paragraphs each making a point supported by evidence, and a concluding paragraph that sums up your judgement. Always link answers to the data or pre-release materials where required, and avoid unsupported generalities. For levels-of-response and evaluative questions, show balance by considering different stakeholders, weigh advantages and disadvantages, and justify your recommendation with evidence from results and wider geographical knowledge. Use precise geographical terms rather than vague language, include data to support claims when possible (for example, refer to measured means, ranges or percentage changes), and label any drawn diagrams or graphs. Manage SPaG by proofreading if time allows; a few corrections can secure additional marks. Finally, practise under timed conditions with past AQA questions and the pre-release materials, and rehearse common field techniques so that you can describe them confidently and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses in the exam.
