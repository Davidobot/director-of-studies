# Crime and deviance: explanations, subcultures and social control (GCSE Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: what sociologists mean by crime and deviance
Crime and deviance are not simply the same thing. In sociology, crime refers to behaviour that breaks the formal laws of a society, whereas deviance covers any behaviour that breaks social norms – those unwritten rules about acceptable conduct. What counts as criminal or deviant varies by place, time and social group: an act that is illegal in one country may be allowed in another, and behaviours that were once acceptable can become condemned (and vice versa). Sociologists emphasise that crime and deviance are socially constructed: definitions depend on who has power to label behaviour, and on social reactions such as news coverage, police attention and public opinion. Understanding these processes helps explain patterns in who commits crime, who is punished and how society responds.

## The social construction of crime: labelling, moral panic and the ‘dark figure’
Sociologists of the interactionist tradition focus on how behaviour becomes defined as deviant. A key idea is labelling: when powerful agents of social control — the police, courts, teachers, employers or the media — define someone as deviant, that label can stick and change the person’s identity and opportunities. Once labelled, individuals may be treated differently by others and by institutions; the label can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where expectations of deviance lead to further offending and a ‘deviant career’. The media can amplify fears about particular kinds of behaviour, creating moral panics and “folk devils” whose actions seem to threaten social order. These reactions influence what is recorded as crime and what is ignored, producing a gap between official figures and reality known as the ‘dark figure’ of crime. Many offences – for example domestic abuse, sexual assault or minor frauds – are under-reported to the police, so sociologists use surveys and self-report studies alongside official statistics to get a fuller picture.

## Functionalist and strain theories: anomie and Merton’s responses
Functionalist explanations start from the idea that society has shared values and goals. Robert Merton developed a strain theory to explain crime as the result of a gap between culturally promoted goals (such as wealth or success) and the legitimate means available to achieve them. When people are unable to attain success by approved routes, they may adapt in different ways: some conform, others innovate (using illegitimate means like theft), some retreat or rebel. Merton’s theory helps explain why crime rates are often higher among disadvantaged groups: blocked opportunities increase strain and the appeal of criminal solutions. Functionalist accounts highlight structural causes rather than individual pathology and are useful for explaining patterns of property crime and some forms of delinquency, although critics point out that not everyone under strain turns to crime and that the theory underestimates organised or corporate crime.

## Subcultural accounts and delinquency: Cohen and the status response
Subcultural explanations examine how groups develop alternative values and norms that justify criminal behaviour. Albert Cohen studied working-class boys who shared mainstream success goals but lacked legitimate means to achieve them. Cohen argued that status frustration emerged from educational failure and blocked opportunities, and that some boys responded by forming delinquent subcultures where they gained status through behaviour that rejected mainstream values: vandalism, truancy and theft became sources of respect within the peer group. Subcultural accounts are helpful when analysing youth gang behaviour and forms of non-utilitarian vandalism, because they show how group identity and peer recognition shape actions. It is important to connect subcultural explanations to wider social contexts: patterns of family life, local unemployment and policing all influence why subcultures form and how long they endure.

## Feminist and Marxist perspectives: gender, class and power
Feminist and Marxist approaches focus on power relations and structural inequality. Feminist explanations look at how patriarchy and gendered social control influence patterns of offending and victimisation. For example, feminists point out that women generally commit fewer recorded crimes, which can be explained in part by tighter social controls on women’s behaviour, different opportunities, and under-reporting of male violence against women. Heidensohn argued that patriarchal control in the home, workplace and public sphere limits female criminality; at the same time, gendered responses by police and courts may treat female offenders differently. Carlen’s research with convicted women linked crime to poverty and the breakdown of the ‘class deal’ and ‘gender deal’: when expected rewards and protections are absent, crime can become a rational choice.

Marxist explanations emphasise class inequality. From this view, laws reflect the interests of the ruling class and criminal justice systems often protect property and capitalist relations. Corporate and white-collar crimes may be under-policed compared with street crime; the visibility of working-class offending combined with heavier policing leads to class-biased statistics. Marxist and feminist perspectives complement each other when analysing who is labelled, who is punished, and how structural inequalities shape both crime and official responses.

## Social control: formal and informal, agents and sanctions
Social control refers to the ways society enforces norms and laws. Formal social control includes policing, courts, prisons and formal sanctions such as fines and imprisonment. Informal social control operates through family, peers, schools, workplaces and community expectations; shame, gossip and social exclusion are powerful informal sanctions. Sociologists explore how different agents exercise control and the inequalities of that control. For example, stop-and-search practices and sentencing patterns show how ethnicity and class affect police attention and punishments. The balance between control and rehabilitation is also debated: some argue that punitive systems reduce crime through deterrence, while others emphasise rehabilitation, addressing causes such as poverty, education and mental health. Feminist critiques highlight how control can be gendered, with women subject to different expectations and threats (for instance, the policing of women’s sexuality) and with gendered harms like domestic violence often treated inadequately by formal systems.

## Measuring crime: statistics, victim surveys and ethical issues
To study crime, sociologists rely on several kinds of data. Police-recorded statistics show crimes that come to official attention but are shaped by reporting practices, recording rules and resource priorities. Victim surveys, such as national crime surveys, ask people about their experiences and reveal many offences not recorded by the police, helping to estimate the dark figure. Self-report studies ask offenders about their own behaviour and are useful for understanding unreported low-level offending. Each method has strengths and weaknesses: official statistics are continuous and cover crime outcomes but miss hidden crime; surveys reveal hidden crime but depend on memory and willingness to disclose; qualitative interviews provide depth and context but are not easily generalised. Ethical issues arise in research with victims and offenders, including consent, confidentiality and the risk of harm. Sociologists must balance the need for accurate data with respect for participants and careful handling of sensitive topics.

## Applying theory to explain patterns: class, gender, ethnicity and age
When answering questions about crime, it helps to link theory to empirical patterns. Social class is strongly associated with many forms of recorded crime, partly because of the distribution of opportunity and partly because of differential policing. Gender differences are pronounced: men commit most recorded violent and property offences, while women are more likely to be victims of some forms of abuse; explanations draw on control theory, opportunity structures and gendered socialisation. Ethnicity is a focus of debate because some minority groups are over-represented in criminal justice statistics; sociologists examine factors such as socio-economic disadvantage, discriminatory policing practices, and institutional racism. Age is also relevant: youth are more likely to be involved in certain types of offending, which raises questions about the causes of youthful delinquency and the role of prevention, education and diversion schemes. Good answers combine a clear explanation of patterns with theoretical perspectives and up-to-date examples, for instance recent debates about knife crime, the role of social media in enabling offences, or the public response to corporate scandals.

## Exam technique
To write high-scoring answers in exams, begin by making sure you fully understand the question and plan your response briefly. Use sociological terms such as anomie, labelling, delinquent subculture, moral panic and the dark figure correctly and integrate theory with evidence: when you describe a theory (AO1), show how it explains a real pattern (AO2) and then evaluate its limitations (AO3). For example, when discussing Merton, explain the concept of strain, apply it to working-class property crime, and then critique it by noting that it underplays white-collar crime and individual choice. Balance description and evaluation throughout rather than saving all evaluation to the end. Use contemporary or historical examples to illustrate points and make comparisons between perspectives: showing how interactionism and Marxism offer different explanations for the same phenomenon will gain marks. In longer answers include a brief conclusion that draws together your argument and makes a clear judgement. Finally, manage your time: allocate minutes according to the marks available, leave a few minutes to check terminology and to ensure each paragraph directly answers the question.
