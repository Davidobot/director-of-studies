# Classical sociologists: Durkheim, Marx and Weber (GCSE Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Why these three matter for GCSE Sociology
Durkheim, Marx and Weber are called “classical” sociologists because their ideas laid the foundations of sociology as a distinct way of thinking about society. Each offered a different lens for explaining how social life is organised, why people behave as they do, and what causes social continuity and change. Studying their views helps you to compare explanations, practise using sociological concepts and apply theory to the GCSE topics of families, education, crime and deviance, and social stratification. Teachers and examiners expect you to recognise each thinker’s core ideas, to understand them in the context of their time and place, and to use them to interpret contemporary issues. That means knowing more than a list of terms: you should be able to explain what each theorist meant, give an example, and evaluate strengths and weaknesses when you write exam answers.

## Emile Durkheim: social facts, solidarity and the functions of institutions
Durkheim saw society as more than a collection of individuals; he argued that social life is organised by “social facts” — patterns of behaviour, values and institutions that exist outside any one person but shape their actions. His main concern was how societies hold together. In simpler or traditional societies social cohesion is built on shared beliefs and similar roles, a condition he sometimes described as mechanical solidarity. In modern, industrial societies cohesion depends on the interdependence of specialised roles and a shared system of values, which he called organic solidarity. For Durkheim, institutions such as the family and the education system perform essential functions. Education transmits the norms and values that bind people to the collective and prepares individuals for life in a wider social system. Durkheim was also interested in social order and the consequences when norms break down; the term anomie, used to describe normlessness, became central to later explanations of social problems. When you apply Durkheim in GCSE answers, highlight how he explains stability and cohesion and use examples such as the role of schools in teaching punctuality, discipline and common values to illustrate his ideas. Be aware of common criticisms: his account sometimes reads as conservative, assuming broad consensus and downplaying conflict and inequality.

## Karl Marx: class, capitalism and the reproduction of inequality
Marx provided a conflict-centred view of society. He argued that the organisation of production — who owns factories, land, capital and the means to make a living — shapes every other part of social life. In capitalist societies, Marx identified two fundamental classes: the bourgeoisie, who own the means of production, and the proletariat, who sell their labour. For Marx, class conflict is the motor of history because the interests of owners and workers are opposed. He developed the idea that ruling classes use ideology — ideas, culture and institutions — to justify their domination and to reproduce consent. From this perspective the family, the education system and the media can all play parts in reproducing the labour force and legitimising inequality. Marx also wrote about alienation under capitalism, the feeling that work and social life can become meaningless when people have little control over what they do or produce. When you use Marx in GCSE answers, show how his ideas explain unequal outcomes in education and employment, or how family life can reproduce class relations. Remember common critiques: critics say Marx places too much emphasis on economic causes (economic determinism), underestimated the resilience of capitalism, and did not sufficiently predict the growth of a diverse middle class.

## Max Weber: multidimensional social stratification, authority and verstehen
Weber offered a more layered picture than either Durkheim or Marx. He agreed that class mattered, but he argued that social stratification is multidimensional and must consider class, status and party. Class refers to economic position in the market and life chances, status to prestige and social honour, and party to political power and organisation. Weber also distinguished between types of authority: traditional authority based on custom, charismatic authority based on devotion to an extraordinary leader, and legal‑rational authority grounded in rules and offices — the form found in modern bureaucracies. Methodologically, Weber introduced the idea of verstehen, which means trying to understand social action by interpreting the meanings that actors attach to their behaviour. This interpretive approach is important when sociologists study motivation, religion, and culture. For GCSE use, Weber helps explain why different groups with similar economic positions may behave differently and why power is not simply a matter of ownership. When evaluating Weber, note that his approach is more complex and less deterministic than Marx’s, but some critics argue it can be harder to apply at scale or to predict structural change.

## How the three compare: consensus vs conflict and views of social change
Durkheim is typically associated with a consensus view of society: shared values and institutions create cohesion. Marx is the classic conflict theorist: social life is shaped by exploitation and class struggle. Weber sits between and beyond them, offering tools to analyse structure and meaning without insisting on a single explanatory factor. These differences show up across GCSE topics. For example, Durkheim explains the function of education in transmitting shared values and creating social solidarity, Marx sees education as reproducing class inequalities and training obedient workers, and Weber draws attention to how class, status and party intersect to shape educational outcomes and access to opportunities. In terms of social change, Marx expected conflict and revolution as capitalism developed, Durkheim saw change as a shift in the basis of solidarity, and Weber emphasised the role of ideas, authority and bureaucracy in shaping the pace and direction of change. When you compare them in exam answers, focus on the core explanatory claims, use specific examples to show differences, and then evaluate by considering what each perspective explains well and what it leaves out.

## Applying Durkheim, Marx and Weber across GCSE topics
Classical theory is most useful in GCSE when it is applied to concrete social phenomena. In families, Marxist analyses show how families can reproduce labour power and unequal gendered divisions of domestic labour; Durkheimian approaches focus on the family’s role in socialisation and emotional support; Weber’s framework helps explain class and status differences in family life and life chances. In education, Durkheim’s emphasis on transmitting values links directly to discussions of the hidden curriculum; Marxist ideas underpin the correspondence principle and arguments that schools reproduce class inequalities; Weber helps you think about how life chances, credentials and status affect access to higher education. In crime and deviance, Durkheim’s ideas about anomie help explain why norms break down and crime rises in periods of rapid change, Marxists point to laws protecting property and powerful interests while labelling theory (influenced by interactionism rather than classical theory) shows how societal reactions shape deviance; Weberian concepts of authority and legitimacy clarify why some rules are accepted and others resisted. In social stratification, Marx supplies the language of exploitation and class conflict, Weber supplies a richer vocabulary for thinking about prestige and political power, and Durkheim can be used to explain why certain divisions are accepted or ritualised. Always link theory to specific examples, such as differences between state and private schools, patterns in employment and life chances, or debates about criminal justice and sentencing. Using up-to-date examples — such as current debates about education funding, gender pay gaps, or media coverage of crime — demonstrates that you can apply classical theory to the modern UK context.

## Strengths, criticisms and using evidence
Each classical thinker contributes distinctive strengths. Durkheim draws attention to the importance of social structures and the functions they perform. Marx offers a powerful critique of power and inequality rooted in economic relations. Weber adds analytical precision and an appreciation of meaning, authority and multiple dimensions of stratification. At the same time, each has limits. Durkheim can underplay conflict and diversity, Marx can overemphasise economic causes and underestimate the complexity of modern societies, and Weber’s approach is sometimes criticised for lack of a clear programme for social change. In exams you should balance theory with evidence. Use empirical data, historical context and contemporary examples to support a point. Where the specification names later scholars who developed or criticised classical ideas — for example, writers who apply Marxist or feminist perspectives to families and education — referencing these critiques strengthens your evaluation. It is also useful to mention methodological differences: Durkheim’s search for regularities and social facts, Marx’s historical materialism, and Weber’s interpretive, meaning-based approach all influence the kinds of evidence they favour.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions, always be clear which assessment objective you are addressing. AO1 requires clear knowledge and understanding: define the theorist’s key idea, name the sociologist and locate the idea in time and place if relevant. AO2 requires application: apply the idea to the topic in the question, using an example from families, education, crime or stratification to show you can use theory to explain real social phenomena. AO3 requires analysis and evaluation: criticise the theorist’s view, compare it with another perspective, consider the quality of the evidence, and draw a reasoned conclusion. Start short answers with a precise definition and one linked example. For longer responses plan paragraphs that make a claim, explain it with theory, illustrate with evidence or a contemporary example, and then evaluate by pointing out a limitation or alternative view. Use key terms (for example social facts, anomie, means of production, ideology, life chances, status, charismatic authority) naturally in your explanation. When asked to compare perspectives, do so systematically: set out each theory’s explanation, highlight direct contrasts and then weigh up which is more convincing for the question asked. Time management is crucial: spend longer on high-mark questions and remember to include a short concluding judgement on the final page of a 12, 16 or 20+ mark answer to secure AO3 marks. Practice writing concise definitions and two-sentence evaluations that you can adapt in the exam. Above all, demonstrate clear understanding, back claims with examples, and show you can think critically about what each classical sociologist explains well and what they miss.
