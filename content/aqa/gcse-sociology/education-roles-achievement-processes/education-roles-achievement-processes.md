# Education: roles, achievement and processes in schools (GCSE Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What education does for society and the individual
Education performs several key functions both for the individual and for wider society. At the broadest level schools pass on the shared norms and values that hold societies together: punctuality, respect for rules, cooperation and the idea that achievement should be recognised. This socialising role helps to create social cohesion by preparing young people to play their part in adult life. For individuals, education provides qualifications and skills needed for work and for social mobility, offering routes into further study and employment. Schools also sort and select pupils for different social roles through examinations and assessment, a process that links education to the economy because employers use qualifications to recruit and train a workforce. In addition to these explicit tasks, education has less visible effects: through the hidden curriculum pupils learn attitudes and behaviours that are not listed on timetables but that matter for future success, and through day-to-day interactions schools can reproduce wider patterns of inequality.

When you study these functions it helps to think in two directions at once: what society expects from schools (for example supplying a skilled workforce) and how schools actually operate in practice (for example whether they genuinely provide equal opportunity). These two views open up the main debates in the sociology of education around consensus versus conflict, and about the balance between social structures and individual agency.

## Key sociological perspectives on education
Different sociological theories explain the role of education in contrasting ways. Functionalists, such as Durkheim and Parsons, see schools as essential parts of social life that teach shared values and prepare pupils for their future roles. Durkheim emphasised the transmission of collective norms and the importance of schools in creating social solidarity. Parsons argued that schools act as a bridge between particularistic family standards and the universalistic standards of wider society, promoting meritocracy where achieved status replaces inherited privilege.

Marxist perspectives provide a critical alternative. Bowles and Gintis argued that schools reproduce the class structure and the labour force that capitalism needs. Their correspondence principle suggests that the organisation and relationships in schools mirror those of the workplace, socialising pupils into acceptance of hierarchical and obedient roles. From a Marxist point of view meritocracy is an ideological cover for inequality: apparent equality of opportunity masks class-based advantages.

Interactionist perspectives focus on classroom processes and the meanings pupils and teachers attach to behaviour. Labelling theory shows how teachers’ expectations can produce self-fulfilling prophecies: a pupil labelled as "able" or "difficult" is likely to behave in ways that confirm the label. Feminist perspectives highlight how schools can reproduce gendered expectations and inequalities through curriculum choices, teacher interactions and the structure of opportunity.

When answering exam questions, always identify which perspective you are using and explain its core idea before applying it to an example from schooling.

## Education and capitalism: the correspondence principle and marketisation
One of the most influential arguments connecting education to the economy is the correspondence principle. This idea, developed from a Marxist perspective, claims that the organisation of schools corresponds to the needs of capitalist production: punctuality, hierarchy, acceptance of authority and the division of labour are learned in school and then transferred to the workplace. Critics of this view point out that the relationship between school and work is complex and that many other factors shape both.

From the 1980s onwards education policy in many countries introduced market-style reforms that emphasise competition, parental choice and accountability. Policies such as league tables, academies and increased autonomy for schools are intended to raise standards by creating incentives to improve. However, marketisation can produce unintended consequences. Schools competing for better exam results may encourage selection by covert means, focus resources on more able pupils, or increase inequality because middle-class parents are better placed to use choice. Ball’s research highlights how parental choice and league tables can reinforce social sorting, while policy debates continue about whether market mechanisms increase efficiency without worsening inequality.

Use concrete policy examples when explaining marketisation in the exam and balance your answer with evidence about both intended and unintended effects.

## Factors affecting educational achievement: class, gender and ethnicity
Achievement in education is shaped by a mix of social, cultural and school-based factors. Social class remains a strong predictor of educational outcomes. Studies of social mobility show that children from higher socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to access post-16 education and university. Material resources, parental support, cultural knowledge and expectations all contribute. Halsey’s work on class-based inequalities documents the long-term patterns that link class and educational opportunity, although debates remain about how far policy can close these gaps.

Gender differences in achievement have changed over time. Historically boys tended to outperform girls, but recent decades have seen girls overtake boys in many measures at GCSE and A-level. Sociologists link this shift to changes in gender roles, different patterns of motivation and teaching, and policy interventions that encourage girls’ aspirations. Feminist analyses caution that even where girls perform better on paper, inequalities remain in subject choices, career paths and leadership roles.

Ethnicity also affects achievement, but the relationship is complex and varies between groups. Cultural factors, language, family support, experiences of racism, and socio-economic position all combine to influence outcomes. Sociologists emphasise that group averages hide within-group variation and that policy must address both material disadvantage and institutional bias.

When you explain achievement, use specific mechanisms such as cultural capital, material deprivation and teacher expectations to show how social background translates into different outcomes.

## Processes within schools that shape outcomes
The internal organisation of schools and daily interactions have a powerful effect on pupils’ experiences and results. Practices such as setting and streaming group pupils by ability; they can allow teaching to be targeted more precisely, yet they also risk labelling and reducing expectations for those placed in lower sets. Labelling by teachers can influence pupils’ self-concepts and effort, producing self-fulfilling prophecies where high expectations raise achievement and low expectations depress it. Ball’s research on teacher expectations shows how labels become embedded in a school’s routines and how pupil identities are affected.

The curriculum itself—both formal and hidden—matters. The formal curriculum determines what knowledge and skills are taught, while the hidden curriculum consists of the implicit lessons conveyed by school rules, routines and reward systems. The hidden curriculum can reproduce social values, such as conformity or competitiveness, which align with particular social or economic needs.

Not all pupils accept the values schools promote. Willis’s study of counter-school culture shows how groups of pupils can resist school authority and create their own subcultural status systems. Resistance can therefore be both a response to perceived unfairness and a way of producing identities. In exam answers you should illustrate processes with classroom-level examples and explain the consequences for different groups of pupils.

## Research methods and using evidence in education studies
Sociological study of education draws on both qualitative and quantitative methods, each offering strengths and weaknesses. Quantitative data, such as exam results and national statistics, show patterns and trends that are essential for measuring achievement and comparing groups. Qualitative methods, including interviews, observation and ethnography, reveal how pupils and teachers experience schooling and help explain why patterns exist.

Mixed methods combine the two approaches to provide a fuller picture: statistics identify a pattern, while interviews and observations help explain the mechanisms behind it. When designing research in education you must consider practical issues such as access to schools, time and cost, and ethical concerns including informed consent, confidentiality and the protection of vulnerable pupils. Small-scale classroom studies can be valuable teaching tools, but students should be aware of sampling issues, reliability and representativeness when generalising findings.

In exams, you will be expected to evaluate methods. Explain what a method reveals about education, acknowledge limitations (for example the issue of the dark figure in behaviour research or bias in self-report surveys), and suggest how combining methods or improving research design could strengthen conclusions.

## Exam technique
To succeed in exams, connect sociological theory, evidence and analysis in every answer. Start short questions by defining key terms and stating the relevant perspective. For longer answers, plan briefly: set out your argument, apply sociological ideas to the question using examples, then evaluate. Always show awareness of alternative explanations and the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence you use. For evaluation, consider methodological limits, historical change, differences between groups, and policy implications.

When answering 12- or 20-mark questions, allocate time so you can develop a clear line of argument and include at least one well-developed evaluation point. Use named sociologists and specific studies (for example Durkheim on social solidarity, Parsons on meritocracy, Bowles and Gintis on the correspondence principle, Ball on parental choice, Willis on counter-school culture) to demonstrate AO1 knowledge, apply these ideas to contemporary or classroom examples to meet AO2, and then criticise or compare perspectives for AO3 marks. Where a question asks about data, describe patterns and trends, explain possible causes and comment on data limitations such as under-reporting or sampling bias.

Practice writing concise introductions and clear conclusions that summarise your main judgement. Use sociological terminology accurately, link theory to evidence, and keep your writing focused on the question. Finally, revise by explaining concepts aloud, applying theories to current education issues you know about, and practising past-paper questions under timed conditions so you build confidence in structuring and refining answers.
