# Sociological perspectives (functionalism, Marxism, feminism, interactionism) (GCSE Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Why perspectives matter
Sociological perspectives are the big-picture lenses that sociologists use to explain how society works and why people behave as they do. At GCSE you will be expected to know the key features of four major perspectives — functionalism, Marxism, feminism and interactionism — and to use them to explain topics such as families, education, crime and deviance, and social stratification. Perspectives help you move beyond everyday common sense by offering organised explanations, highlighting different causes and consequences, and suggesting which kinds of evidence matter. Knowing how each perspective understands concepts such as social structure, socialisation, power, inequality and identity gives you a toolkit for answering questions, comparing explanations and reaching well‑supported conclusions.

## Functionalism: order, roles and consensus
Functionalism sees society as a system of interlocking parts that work together to maintain stability and social order. Key thinkers associated with this view argued that institutions like the family and the school perform important functions that keep society running. For example, the family is seen as providing primary socialisation — teaching children the culture, norms and values they need — and offering emotional support to adults, sometimes called the stabilisation of adult personalities. Schools are viewed as transmitting shared norms and preparing young people for their future roles in the economy. Functionalists often assume a general value consensus and suggest that social institutions are largely beneficial because they meet society’s needs.

In application, functionalist ideas explain why social institutions exist and how they maintain cohesion. Durkheim’s idea that education builds social solidarity helps explain why history lessons or national ceremonies are emphasised. Parsons’ view of schools as meritocratic shows how status is supposedly earned through achievement rather than inherited privilege. Functionalism also provides a way to interpret social change: if an institution no longer performs its function, social structures adapt or new institutions emerge. Criticisms you should be ready to discuss include the perspective’s tendency to ignore conflict, to idealise social institutions, and to underplay power inequalities and exploitation.

## Marxism: class, capitalism and conflict
Marxism focuses on social class, economic structures and the conflicts that arise from the ownership and control of resources. From this viewpoint, the organisation of the economy — who owns the means of production and who does the labour — shapes all other parts of society, including families, education and law. Marxist sociologists argue that schools reproduce class inequality by teaching values and skills that reflect the interests of the ruling class; the idea that education prepares a compliant workforce is often summarised as the correspondence principle. Families are also analysed in terms of how they support the capitalist economy, for example by reproducing future labour power and performing unpaid domestic labour. Crime can be understood as either a product of inequality and poverty or as behaviour that challenges the interests of the powerful and so is labelled and punished.

When you use Marxism in answers, explain how economic structures create unequal life chances and how institutions reproduce class advantage. Mention classic arguments about ideology and false consciousness to show how beliefs can conceal exploitation. Be ready to evaluate by noting strengths, such as its focus on material inequality and historical change, and weaknesses, such as underestimating gender or cultural diversity or over‑predicting proletarian revolution. Contemporary debates link Marxist ideas to globalisation, consumer culture and new forms of work, which can help you apply the perspective to modern issues.

## Feminism: patriarchy, gendered power and diversity of approaches
Feminist perspectives centre gender and power, arguing that many social structures are organised in ways that advantage men and disadvantage women. Feminist writers have highlighted how the family, workplace, criminal justice system and even research practices can reproduce patriarchy. Early feminist critiques pointed to the domestic division of labour and the unpaid work of wives as mechanisms that benefit men, while more recent work explores multiple patriarchy, intersectionality and how class, ethnicity, sexuality and age interact with gender to shape life chances.

Different strands of feminism emphasise different processes. Radical feminism highlights male violence and control; Marxist or socialist feminism links women’s oppression to capitalism and domestic labour; liberal feminism focuses on legal reforms and equality of opportunity; intersectional approaches show why analyses that consider just one factor (gender) can miss how disadvantages stack up. In exams you should use feminist ideas to explain patterns such as the gender pay gap, differential treatment of women in the criminal justice system, or the persistence of sexist representations in media. Evaluations should consider the explanatory power of feminism, but also its internal variety and the need to account for men’s and women’s diverse experiences.

## Interactionism: labels, identity and the micro-level
Interactionism looks at everyday social interaction and the meanings people create in small‑scale settings. Rather than starting with large structures, interactionists examine how identities and roles emerge through processes such as labelling, negotiation and interpretation. A classic example is the labelling theory of deviance: whether an act is defined as criminal depends on social reactions. Once labelled, a person may internalise that label and behave accordingly, producing a self‑fulfilling prophecy and a deviant career. Interactionist research often uses qualitative methods such as participant observation, unstructured interviews and case studies to capture people’s subjective experiences.

Apply interactionism by explaining how micro‑level processes shape outcomes in education and crime. For instance, teacher expectations and labelling can affect student performance; a pupil labelled as ‘problematic’ may be excluded or demotivated, reinforcing the label. In policing, selective enforcement can mean that certain groups are more likely to be recorded as offenders. When evaluating interactionism, note its strength in illuminating agency, meaning and processes that macro theories overlook, but also its limits in explaining wider structural patterns like class inequality or systemic gendered disadvantage.

## Using perspectives across topics and methods
To show strong sociological thinking you should apply perspectives to the four core topics: families, education, crime and deviance, and social stratification, and relate them to research methods. For families, functionalism explains socialisation and stability while feminism highlights unequal domestic labour and patriarchal control; Marxism adds a critique of how families support capitalist reproduction. For education, use functionalist ideas about social cohesion and meritocracy alongside Marxist arguments about the correspondence principle and evidence of class-based inequalities. For crime, combine interactionist labelling explanations with Marxist accounts of laws reflecting ruling class interests and feminist analyses of gendered victimisation and control. For stratification, contrast functionalist ideas about role allocation with Marxist and Weberian accounts of class, status and life chances, and use feminist theories to address gendered patterns of poverty and power.

Research methods link directly to perspectives. Interactionist research often relies on qualitative methods that reveal meanings and processes, while Marxist and functionalist arguments are frequently supported by quantitative data showing patterns and structural relationships. Be ready to discuss strengths and weaknesses of official statistics, surveys, interviews and observation in relation to the question asked. For example, official crime statistics can reveal trends but also hide the ‘dark figure’ of unreported offences; qualitative interviews can explain how people experience poverty but may not be generalisable. A balanced answer will combine theory with appropriate evidence and reflect on methodological issues such as validity, reliability, ethics and access.

## How to compare and evaluate perspectives
Comparing perspectives is not simply listing differences; it requires explanation, evidence and judgement. Start by explaining each perspective’s core assumptions, then apply them to the issue in the question with concrete examples or statistics where possible. After applying each perspective, evaluate its usefulness: does it explain the causes, consequences and who benefits or loses? Does it account for change or agency? Are there empirical weaknesses or contradictions? You should also consider syncretic approaches: some problems are best understood by combining insights, for example linking class and gender to explain women’s labour market experiences. Always return to the question and use theoretical comparison to reach a clear, justified conclusion about which explanation you find most convincing and why.

## Exam technique
Answering higher‑mark GCSE sociology questions successfully involves clear structure, use of theory, application, evidence and evaluation. Begin short answers by defining key concepts succinctly and directly. When the question asks for explanations, introduce the perspective, state its main claim, and immediately apply it to the case in the question — for example, explain how the correspondence principle would describe school practices and then give a concrete example such as tracking or differential rates of university entry. For extended answers follow a simple cycle: definition and outline of a theory; application to the issue with evidence or examples; evaluation that considers strengths and limitations and alternative perspectives; and a brief conclusion that answers the question. Use sociological terms correctly and name key thinkers when relevant to show AO1 knowledge, use evidence and context to demonstrate AO2 application, and offer balanced critique to meet AO3 analysis and evaluation. Manage your time by allocating minutes per mark, leaving a short period at the end to check you have answered the question set and to add a concluding sentence that sums up your judgement. When comparing perspectives, balance the discussion by giving roughly equal attention to each and by explicitly comparing their explanatory power. Finally, make use of evidence sources: refer to trends, statistics or classic studies when you can, but be cautious about making unsupported factual claims. Clear, reasoned argument and accurate use of perspectives will earn the marks.
