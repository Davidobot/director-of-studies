# Social stratification: class, power, poverty and life chances (GCSE Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What social stratification means and why it matters
Social stratification is the way a society is divided into layers or groups that have unequal access to resources, status and power. These differences shape people’s everyday lives: who gets the best jobs, who has the safest homes, who is most likely to go to university, and who is most likely to face poor health or unemployment. For GCSE Sociology it helps to think of stratification not as a single thing but as a set of linked processes: economic position (class), prestige and status, political influence and authority, and the material experience of poverty. Understanding stratification also means asking questions about fairness, how societies justify inequality and how different groups experience opportunities—what sociologists call “life chances.”

Stratification is important because it affects what people can realistically achieve. A young person from a wealthy background typically has different life chances from a young person from a low-income family. These differences are shaped by institutions—education, the labour market, the welfare state—and by cultural expectations and discrimination. In the UK context, patterns of class, gender and ethnic inequality shape outcomes in education, health, work and criminal justice. Studying social stratification helps you explain these patterns and evaluate the different explanations that sociologists offer.

## Major theories: functionalism, Marxism and Weberian approaches
Sociologists offer different accounts of why societies are stratified. Functionalist theories, such as the ideas developed by Davis and Moore, argue that some inequality is necessary to make sure that the most important jobs are filled by the most qualified people. In this view, unequal rewards (higher pay, prestige) motivate people to train for demanding roles and to perform well. Critics point out that this explanation assumes a meritocracy and ignores how inherited advantage, discrimination and unequal schooling can block access to top jobs.

Marxist theory focuses on class and exploitation. For Marx, the key division is between those who own the means of production (capitalists or bourgeoisie) and those who sell their labour (workers or proletariat). Class conflict is central: the ruling class shape laws, culture and institutions in ways that protect their economic interests, and ideology can produce “false consciousness,” where the exploited accept their position. Marxist explanations are useful for understanding structural, economic causes of inequality and why the wealthy often have disproportionate influence over policy.

Max Weber added complexity to the debate by arguing that stratification is multi-dimensional. He identified class as one dimension (linked to market position and life chances), but also introduced status (social prestige or honour based on lifestyle, education or kinship) and party (organised political power) as separate sources of inequality. Weber’s approach helps explain why people who do not own capital may still have high status or political influence—for example, a respected university professor or a popular celebrity—and why social divisions are not always a simple capitalist/working-class split.

## Socio-economic class: how we identify class and why it matters
Class can be understood in several ways. The Marxist view focuses on ownership and exploitation, arguing that class position determines life chances and social relationships. Weberian accounts emphasise market situation and life chances, showing how similar economic positions can lead to similar opportunities. In practice, sociologists also use occupational categories (for example, professional, managerial, skilled manual, semi-skilled, unskilled) to identify class differences in studies, and they look at income, wealth and education together.

Class matters because it affects access to resources across the life course. Families with more income can afford better housing, extracurricular activities, private tuition or enrichment opportunities. They are more likely to live near high-performing schools, have networks that help with job searches, and to pass on cultural capital—knowledge, language and habits that schools value. Class is also not fixed: social mobility describes movement up or down the class hierarchy. Intergenerational mobility depends on education systems, labour markets and welfare policies; historical studies show that mobility varies across time and place.

Devine’s work on the “affluent worker” revisited earlier ideas about the decline of traditional working-class lifestyles. Her findings show that rising living standards do not necessarily mean that class identities disappear; people may gain consumer goods while still feeling disadvantaged compared to those with inherited wealth. Such studies remind us that class is both material and cultural.

## Life chances and the factors that shape them
The sociological concept of life chances captures the opportunities people have for achieving desirable outcomes—good health, stable employment, safe housing, and educational success. Factors that influence life chances include social class, gender, ethnicity, age, disability and religion. These intersect: for example, women from minority ethnic backgrounds may face both gender and racial discrimination in the labour market, reducing their life chances more than if only one form of disadvantage were present.

Education is a central mechanism that shapes life chances. Access to quality schooling, expectations from teachers, and processes such as setting and streaming can either reproduce or reduce inequality. Health outcomes are also patterned by class: lower-income groups tend to have higher rates of chronic illness and shorter life expectancy. Employment opportunities are influenced by the structure of the economy, skills demand and labour market policies; precarious work and zero-hours contracts reduce security and future prospects for many.

Understanding life chances involves looking at both structural barriers and individual agency. Sociologists examine how institutions, cultural norms and economic policies shape options, while also recognising that people make choices within constrained conditions.

## Poverty and the idea of the underclass
Poverty can be measured in different ways. Absolute poverty refers to a lack of the basic necessities needed for survival. Relative poverty, a concept used in many contemporary studies, compares people’s resources to the living standards of the society in which they live. Peter Townsend’s work emphasised relative deprivation: poverty is about lacking the resources required to participate in ordinary social life in your society. Townsend used a deprivation index to show how many households were excluded from common standards of living.

Different explanations of poverty compete in sociology. Some focus on structural causes—job loss, low wages, welfare changes and globalisation—while others emphasise cultural explanations, where long-term disadvantage produces attitudes and behaviours that make social mobility harder. Charles Murray’s idea of an “underclass” suggested that welfare dependency and alternative values were creating a socially isolated and burdensome group. This argument has been controversial because it tends to blame individuals rather than examining the structural roots of poverty, and evidence often points to complex causes rather than a single cultural explanation.

Public policy responses—such as welfare reforms, minimum wage laws, education investment and housing policy—reflect these debates. Sociologists examine which policies reduce poverty and how their effects vary by region, age and family type.

## Power, authority and gendered inequalities
Power and authority are central to stratification. Weber’s distinctions between traditional, charismatic and rational-legal authority help explain different bases for leadership and control. Traditional authority rests on custom and inheritance, charismatic authority on personal appeal, and rational-legal authority on rules and procedures (for example, bureaucratic positions). Power is also exercised through institutions—governments, corporations, the media and educational systems—and through more informal means, such as social networks and cultural norms.

Feminist analyses highlight how power is gendered. Sylvia Walby’s account of patriarchy outlines multiple structures—paid work, household labour, culture, sexuality, violence and the state—that combine to limit women’s opportunities. Feminists argue that patriarchy intersects with class and race, producing specific disadvantages for groups such as working-class women or women from ethnic minorities. Understanding power relations therefore requires attention to who benefits from existing arrangements and how inequality is maintained through both formal institutions and everyday practices.

Power relationships are also dynamic: social movements, changing public opinion and policy reforms can shift authority and redistribute resources. Examining examples such as the expansion of women into higher education and professional roles, or campaigns for living wage policies, shows how change can happen but also reveals persistent structural barriers.

## Putting theory and evidence together: how to write about stratification
A good GCSE answer on stratification combines clear definitions, sociological theory, specific evidence and evaluation. Begin by defining key terms—class, power, poverty, life chances—and make sure your definitions match the question. Use sociological perspectives to explain the patterns you describe: for example, use Marx to explain class conflict, Weber to add nuance about status and life chances, and functionalism to explain official justifications for inequality. Bring in empirical examples that are concrete and relevant: differences in educational attainment by class, statistics showing poverty rates, or well-known studies that illustrate a point (for instance, Townsend on relative deprivation or Devine on affluent workers). When you evaluate, point out limitations of each theory and consider alternative explanations or recent social changes.

Always link your points back to the question. Avoid simply listing theories; instead show how each perspective helps us understand a specific part of the issue and where it falls short. Use comparative language when asked, and demonstrate awareness of how class intersects with gender, ethnicity, disability and age.

## Exam technique
To succeed in exam answers on social stratification, plan before you write. Read the question carefully and underline command words such as “explain,” “evaluate,” “compare” or “describe.” Make a quick plan that outlines your main argument, the sociological perspectives you will use, and two or three specific examples or studies to illustrate your points. Time management matters: allocate time proportionally to the marks available and leave a few minutes at the end to check your answer.

Structure extended answers with clear paragraphs that each make a single point, support it with evidence or a named sociologist, and show how it answers the question. For evaluative questions, present at least two perspectives and finish by weighing strengths and weaknesses so you reach a reasoned conclusion. Use key terms accurately and include a short definition early on to show knowledge (AO1). Apply those ideas to the context of the question to show application (AO2), and critically assess or compare perspectives, using evidence to support your judgement (AO3).

When quoting studies, briefly explain their relevance rather than just naming them. If you use statistics in an exam, explain what they show and how they support your argument. Finally, practice past-style questions under timed conditions, and review model answers to understand how assessors reward clear argument, balance and precise use of sociological concepts.
