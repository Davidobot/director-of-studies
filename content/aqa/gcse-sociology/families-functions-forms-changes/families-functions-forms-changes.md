# Families: functions, forms and changing relationships (GCSE Sociology Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction and the sociological approach to families
The family is one of the core social structures studied in GCSE Sociology. It is both a practical unit where people live and care for one another and a lens through which sociologists explore issues such as socialisation, power, identity and inequality. When studying families you will be expected to use sociological concepts and evidence to describe what families do, how family life varies, how roles are organised inside households and how relationships change over time. You will also be asked to explain these phenomena using different theoretical perspectives: functionalism, Marxism, feminism and interactionism are the main approaches required by the specification. Learning the key ideas of classical thinkers such as Parsons, and later researchers such as the Rapoports, Willmott and Young, Oakley, Delphy and Zaretsky, will help you to compare competing explanations and to apply them to contemporary family issues in the UK context.

## Functions of families: what families do in society
Sociologists identify a range of functions that families perform. At the most basic level families meet biological and emotional needs: they are involved in sexual regulation, reproduction and the care and socialisation of children. Families provide economic support, by pooling resources and meeting daily material needs. They are also important sites of primary socialisation, where children learn language, norms and values that connect them to wider society, and they can offer emotional support that Durkheim and later functionalists described as stabilising adult personalities. Talcott Parsons, writing as a functionalist, emphasised two universal family functions: the primary socialisation of the young and the stabilisation of adult personalities through emotional bonds within the household. Critics argue that Parsons’ account reflects an idealised, middle-class model and does not capture the diversity of family experiences, but his ideas remain useful for explaining why many sociologists see the family as a building block of social order. Other perspectives treat family functions differently: Marxists stress the family’s role in reproducing labour power and capitalist relationships, while feminists draw attention to how families can reproduce gender inequalities through unpaid domestic labour and unequal power.

## Family forms and diversity
Families take many forms and family structures in the UK have become increasingly diverse over recent decades. The traditional nuclear family—two parents and their children—remains one important type, but extended families, reconstituted or blended families (where one or both partners bring children from previous relationships), lone-parent households, single-person households and same-sex families are all part of today’s social landscape. The Rapoports introduced the idea of family diversity by identifying different dimensions: organisational diversity (how household labour is divided), cultural diversity (different beliefs and practices), class differences (how resources shape family life), life-course differences (family stage) and cohort differences (historical period). Recognising these dimensions helps you to explain why family life varies between households and over time and to resist simplistic claims that there is a single “normal” family. Global comparisons also show variation in family forms and functions, so when asked for context you can contrast UK trends with different cultural or economic settings.

## Conjugal roles and the domestic division of labour
A central topic is how tasks and responsibilities are shared within couples. Sociologists distinguish between segregated conjugal roles, where cooking, childcare and housework are mainly the wife’s responsibility while paid work and household decisions fall to the husband, and joint or integrated roles, where partners share domestic tasks and both take part in childcare and decision-making. Oakley and feminist researchers criticised the idea that conjugal roles are naturally divided: they argued that patriarchal power and gendered socialisation shape expectations and maintain unequal divisions of labour. Willmott and Young, in contrast, described the “symmetrical family” in some cases where couples shared more similar roles and leisure patterns; they suggested that changes in work, technology and gender attitudes could lead to greater symmetry, a process they called “stratified diffusion” as patterns spread through social layers. Today the picture is mixed: many families have moved towards joint roles and dual-earner arrangements, but gendered patterns persist in housework, childcare and control over money. When answering exam questions on conjugal roles you should define the terms, use examples such as dual-career families or the “double shift” experienced by many women, and evaluate competing sociological explanations.

## Changing relationships within families and criticisms of the family
Family relationships have changed across historical periods—pre-industrial, industrial and contemporary—reflecting broader economic, cultural and legal shifts. Industrialisation encouraged the rise of nuclear households separate from extended kin networks. In recent decades changes in gender roles, increased female labour force participation, rising cohabitation and the legal recognition of same-sex couples have altered family dynamics. Sociologists study issues such as parenting quality, the nature of teenage–adult relationships, care for the elderly and disabled, and arranged marriage where cultural practices differ. Criticisms of the family range from claims that it has become isolated or idealised, to arguments that it no longer performs traditional economic functions that were once supplied by extended kin or local communities. Feminist critics such as Delphy and Leonard argue that the family is a site of women’s exploitation, where male partners benefit from unpaid domestic labour. Marxist critics like Zaretsky contend that the family cushions workers from the pressures of capitalism while reproducing inequality and supporting the system through unpaid labour and consumer demand. Evaluative answers will show how each perspective highlights different problems and will consider empirical evidence and counterarguments, for example noting changes in state welfare and workplace rights that alter how families manage care and economic risk.

## Divorce and consequences for family structure
Patterns of divorce in Britain have changed markedly since the mid-20th century. From the 1960s and 1970s onward divorce rates rose substantially as laws were reformed to make divorce more accessible and as social attitudes towards marriage and separation shifted. Key explanations for the rise include changes in divorce law and procedure which reduced legal barriers, greater secularisation, the changing status of women with more economic independence and employment opportunities, and shifting cultural expectations that prioritise personal fulfilment. The consequences of divorce are diverse: breakdowns of marriage can lead to increased numbers of lone-parent families and reconstituted families, altered financial and emotional situations for adults and children, and changes in family networks. Some children experience short-term disruption, while others adapt well; sociological research shows that outcomes are shaped by factors such as parental conflict, economic resources and social support. When considering the impact of divorce it is important to weigh short-term harms against longer-term changes such as reduced stigma around separation and the development of new family forms that better fit people’s lives.

## Applying sociological perspectives and key thinkers
To explain family issues it helps to connect empirical descriptions with sociological theories. Functionalists such as Parsons focus on the stabilising and socialising functions of the family and the notion of role differentiation (instrumental and expressive roles). Marxists emphasise economic structures and argue that families reproduce labour power and capitalist relations, with theorists like Zaretsky highlighting how family life can mask economic exploitation. Feminist writers including Oakley, Delphy and Walby analyse power, patriarchy and gendered divisions of labour, showing how family arrangements often maintain male dominance. Interactionists approach family life by examining meanings and day-to-day interactions, useful for explaining how roles are negotiated and identities formed at the micro-level. Using named thinkers and briefly summarising their core ideas strengthens your answers: say what the thinker argued, apply their idea to the issue, and then evaluate by pointing out limitations or alternative explanations.

## Research and evidence on families
Sociological study of families uses a range of research methods. Quantitative sources such as censuses and official statistics show broad trends in marriage, divorce and household composition; qualitative methods such as interviews, participant observation and case studies reveal lived experience, meanings and power dynamics within households. Mixed methods approaches combine both types of data and are often the most illuminating for family research. When you evaluate evidence in exam answers, consider issues such as reliability, representativeness and the “dark figure” of unreported experiences. Ethical concerns are also important: researching families involves privacy, confidentiality and sensitivity, especially where children or vulnerable adults are concerned. Being able to comment on the appropriateness of methods for answering particular family questions is an AO3 skill that examiners reward.

## Exam technique
In the exam, questions on families will assess three core skills: AO1 (knowledge and understanding), AO2 (application) and AO3 (analysis and evaluation). For AO1 answers define key terms clearly and use appropriate sociological vocabulary such as primary socialisation, nuclear family, conjugal roles, patriarchy and stratified diffusion. Bring in named sociologists and their key ideas to show theoretical knowledge. For AO2 apply theory to the question: if asked about changes in family life, link causes such as legal reform or increased female employment to specific outcomes like higher divorce rates or more dual-earner households. Use concrete examples to illustrate points, such as describing a reconstituted family after a divorce or a dual-career couple sharing childcare. For AO3 make balanced evaluations: when you explain a perspective, follow with limitations, alternative explanations and empirical evidence that supports or challenges the claim. Compare perspectives where relevant and comment on the strength of the evidence and the appropriateness of research methods. Structuring longer answers with clear paragraphs that make a point, explain it, and evaluate it will make your reasoning easy to follow. Manage your time to leave a few minutes at the end for checking that you have used sociological terms, included at least one name or study where appropriate, and answered every part of the question. Practice writing concise introductions and conclusions that link back to the question and show you can synthesise theory and evidence.
