# Prime Minister & Cabinet: power and accountability (A-level Politics Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## The role of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet in the British system
The Prime Minister is the head of government in the UK and the central figure in the core executive: the political leadership that makes, coordinates and drives government policy. The Cabinet is the formal collective body of senior ministers, chaired by the Prime Minister, intended to ensure collective decision-making across major departments. In practice, the relationship between the Prime Minister and Cabinet varies over time and between occupants of No.10. Some eras have been described as “cabinet government”, where decisions emerge from collective deliberation, while others are more “prime ministerial” or “presidential” in style, with the Prime Minister dominating agenda-setting, appointments and policy direction. Understanding this dynamic is key to evaluating how power is exercised and how it is held to account.

## Sources of Prime Ministerial power: formal and informal
A Prime Minister’s power comes from a mix of legal authority, constitutional convention and political resources. Formally, the Prime Minister leads the government, advises the monarch on ministerial appointments, oversees the Cabinet, and benefits from royal prerogatives such as the conduct of foreign affairs and deployment of armed forces (subject to evolving constraints). Informally, power stems from party leadership, control over patronage, ability to set the policy agenda, personal authority, and relationships with advisers and the civil service. Downing Street has its own machinery — the Prime Minister’s Office, special advisers and policy units — which can centralise decision-making. The party’s size and cohesion in the House of Commons are crucial: a large disciplined majority strengthens a Prime Minister, while a small majority, coalition, or deep factional division limits autonomy.

## Cabinet government, collective responsibility and individual responsibility
The Cabinet is theoretically the forum for collective decision-making and collective responsibility: once Cabinet agrees a policy, all ministers are expected to publicly support it or resign. This convention helps present a unified government and protects collective ministerial accountability. Individual ministerial responsibility requires ministers to answer for the operation of their departments and, in some cases, to resign when serious failures occur. In practice, conventions are flexible. Cabinets often delegate detailed decision-making to smaller inner cabinets, cabinet committees or informal “kitchen cabinets” of trusted advisers. There are notable examples where collective responsibility has been tested or where ministers have resigned to maintain the principle. The 1954 Crichel Down affair led to the resignation of Sir Thomas Dugdale, a high-profile early example of ministerial resignation over a departmental matter. Such resignations show the constitutional weight of these conventions even when they are not legally enforceable.

## How policy is made: the core executive and the No.10 machine
Policy-making in modern government is a negotiated process across the core executive, involving the Prime Minister, Cabinet, Cabinet committees, ministers, civil servants and special advisers. The Prime Minister can influence outcomes by setting the agenda, chairing meetings, appointing allies to key posts and using patronage to reward loyalty. Some Prime Ministers concentrate decision-making in No.10 (a phenomenon sometimes described as “sofa government” or the rise of an inner circle), while others rely more on formal Cabinet processes. Two historical examples illustrate the range of prime ministerial influence. The introduction of the Community Charge, commonly known as the poll tax in 1990, showed how a government-wide policy driven from the centre could be implemented despite intense public opposition and internal dissent, with profound political consequences for the Prime Minister. By contrast, the decision to join the 2003 invasion of Iraq under Tony Blair highlights the Prime Minister’s central role in foreign policy and moral-political leadership; that decision provoked intense parliamentary and public scrutiny over the advice used, information presented, and the limits of executive legitimacy.

## Constraints on Prime Ministerial power
No Prime Minister has unfettered authority. Parliamentary constraint is significant: the government must command the confidence of the Commons, and votes, rebellions, select committee scrutiny and opposition activity can limit or shape policy. Party dynamics matter: strong party discipline often enables a Prime Minister to outvote critics, but factional divisions or coalition partners can force concessions. Judicial review and the courts increasingly shape executive action when prerogative powers are invoked, as shown by rulings that require parliamentary approval for certain executive acts. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011 temporarily removed a Prime Minister’s unilateral ability to call a general election and so constrained one political lever, but that Act was later repealed, returning the power to earlier conventions; this demonstrates how constitutional change can alter the balance of executive power. Devolution, public opinion, media scrutiny and the practical limits of administrative capacity and finance also act as important checks. High-profile legal and political moments — for example, judicial interventions that test the reach of prerogative powers — have reinforced the idea that the Prime Minister is powerful but not omnipotent.

## Mechanisms of accountability: politics, parliament and the courts
Accountability of the Prime Minister and Cabinet operates through a mixture of political, parliamentary and legal mechanisms. Parliament provides regular scrutiny through Prime Minister’s Questions, ministerial statements, oral and written questions, debates and votes. Select Committees probe departmental activity, take evidence from ministers and officials, and publish reports that can shape public debate. The opposition’s role is central: its capacity to hold government to account depends on parliamentary arithmetic and public resonance. The ministerial code and institutional norms set standards for conduct, and breaches sometimes result in investigations or resignations. The civil service and permanent secretaries are also sources of internal accountability and institutional memory, though their appearances before committees can be politically controlled. The courts can review the lawfulness of executive action; a leading example in recent decades required the government to seek parliamentary approval to trigger a major constitutional act, showing that legal accountability can limit the exercise of prerogative power. Ultimately, democracy itself — general elections — is the decisive mechanism: voters reward or punish governments for performance, returning the central political accountability loop.

## Illustrative examples in practice
Concrete examples help to show how the balance of power and accountability works in practice. The Crichel Down affair in 1954 is an early and often-cited instance of individual ministerial responsibility: Sir Thomas Dugdale resigned after criticism of departmental maladministration, demonstrating that ministers may be held personally accountable for failures within their remit. The poll tax of 1990 shows the political cost of a centrally-driven policy: its unpopularity and the scale of public protest and Conservative backbench anger contributed to the downfall of a Prime Minister who had pushed the policy. The 2003 invasion of Iraq under Tony Blair reveals the weight of the Prime Minister’s role in foreign policy and how decisions taken at the centre invite sustained parliamentary inquiry, media investigation and public debate about the evidence and the decision-making process. More recently, the 2017 Miller case and related litigation illustrate how courts can require the government to submit significant constitutional steps to parliamentary approval. The resignation of Iain Duncan Smith in 2016 from a cabinet role over welfare policy shows the continuing relevance of ministerial conscience and accountability when policy conflicts arise. Together these cases demonstrate that while the Prime Minister can be the dominant political actor, power is exercised within a web of conventions, institutions and public expectations that can compel explanation, restraint or political consequence.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Prime Ministerial power and Cabinet accountability, start by defining the key terms and setting a clear argument about the extent and limits of Prime Ministerial power. For explain/analysis questions allocate time to outline the formal sources of power (appointments, prerogative, leadership of government) and the informal sources (party control, patronage, No.10 resources), then evaluate using specific examples to illustrate contrasts — for instance comparing mid-20th-century cabinet government with late-20th/early-21st-century centralisation. For evaluative essays, organise a balanced argument: consider reasons that support Prime Ministerial dominance and then the institutional, legal and political restraints that limit it, using case studies such as the poll tax (1990) and Iraq (2003) to substantiate points. In comparative or synoptic answers bring in related institutions (Parliament, the judiciary, party organisations, civil service and public opinion) to show how power is shared and contested. Where relevant, explain conventions (collective and individual ministerial responsibility), how they operate in practice, and provide examples of resignations or cabinet rebellion. Always conclude with a clearly reasoned judgment that reflects the balance of evidence you have presented. Use relevant political vocabulary throughout, and when you quote examples make their dates and significance explicit to demonstrate precise knowledge and understanding.
