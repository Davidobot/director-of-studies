# Political parties, funding and campaigning (A-level Politics Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## The nature and role of political parties
Political parties organise political competition, aggregate interests, develop policy platforms and present choices to voters. In practice their roles include recruiting and selecting candidates, mobilising supporters, structuring parliamentary activity and forming government where possible. Party organisation varies: in the UK parties are relatively centralised in terms of campaign strategy and parliamentary whipping, and party leaders often have strong control over messaging; in the United States parties are looser, with greater independence for individual candidates and state-level organisations. Parties also perform representative functions: some MPs act as delegates, implementing the wishes of their constituents, while others adopt the Burkean trustee model, exercising judgement on complex issues. Understanding these differing structures is essential when analysing why parties behave as they do in government, opposition and at election time.

## Sources of party funding and how they are regulated
Political parties obtain money from membership subscriptions, individual and corporate donations, trade unions, fundraising events, and state provisions such as short money or public grants in some systems. Regulation aims to balance free political expression with transparency and fairness. In the UK the regulatory framework created since the late twentieth century requires declared donations above specified thresholds and places reporting duties on parties; the Electoral Commission enforces reporting and monitors spending limits for campaigns. The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act introduced tighter controls and disclosure requirements, and debates continue about permissible donors and foreign influence. In the United States the Federal Election Commission (FEC) oversees federal campaign finance. Historic reforms such as limits on "soft money" sought to constrain unregulated party spending, but landmark court rulings have altered the terrain. Citizens United (2010) opened the door to large independent expenditures by corporations and unions, leading to the rise of Super PACs and new channels for money to influence elections. Both systems prohibit foreign nationals from contributing directly, but enforcement and loopholes remain topics of ongoing scrutiny.

## How funding shapes party behaviour and policy
Where parties rely on large donors or organised funders they may face real or perceived pressures to prioritise donor interests. In the UK, trade union funding historically sustained the Labour Party’s organisation and policy priorities; reforms since the 1990s changed some formal relationships but money and organisational links still matter. Conservative parties often attract corporate and wealthy individual donors, and these relationships shape access and influence debates on regulatory policy. In the US, fundraising capacity is a key determinant of a candidate’s viability: incumbents typically use their fundraising networks to build war chests that deter challengers, while outsiders must find alternative means such as grassroots small-donor campaigns or independent expenditure groups. The presence of large, often opaque, independent spenders can alter campaign messaging and priorities without direct accountability to voters. Students should consider not only direct quid pro quo corruption, which is illegal, but subtler effects: agenda-setting, privileged access, and long-term policy alignment.

## Campaigning methods: traditional and digital
Campaigning remains a mix of long-standing techniques and rapidly evolving digital practices. Traditional methods such as door-to-door canvassing, leafleting, local meetings, television advertising and national debates still matter because they reach broad swathes of the electorate and build ground-level momentum. Since the 2000s digital tools have transformed how parties and campaigns target voters. Email fundraising, social media mobilisation, microtargeted advertising and data analytics allow tailored messages to specific demographic or attitudinal groups. Successful recent campaigns demonstrate different models: the 2008 Obama campaign pioneered online small-donor fundraising and sophisticated voter modelling; by contrast, more recent campaigns have used targeted social media ads and personalised messaging to influence turnout and persuasion. These digital techniques raise important questions about privacy, the use of harvested data, third-party analytics firms and the regulation of online political advertising. The interplay between old and new methods is a central theme in contemporary campaign studies.

## The impact of electoral systems on funding and campaigning
Electoral systems shape the strategic choices parties make about where and how to spend money. First past the post (FPTP), used for UK general elections, favours targeting marginal constituencies where small swings can change seats; parties therefore allocate disproportionate resources to battlegrounds and to leader appearances that can sway undecided voters. FPTP tends to disadvantage smaller parties with dispersed support, which in turn affects their ability to raise funds and recruit volunteers. Proportional or mixed systems used in devolved administrations produce different incentives: smaller parties gain representation and can attract donors interested in influencing policy through coalition bargaining. In the USA’s single-member district system, fundraising is essential for building name recognition in large, expensive media markets, and presidential campaigns must also negotiate the Electoral College dynamics that shape where campaign spending is most effective. The distributional effects of spending and the rules governing campaign expenditure therefore interact closely with institutional structures to shape political competition.

## Pressure groups, unions, think tanks and outside spending
Beyond parties, a diverse ecosystem of pressure groups, trade unions, business associations, think tanks and philanthropic foundations plays a major role in funding and campaigning. Some groups act as insider organisations with routine access to policymakers; others run outsider campaigns that mobilise public opinion through media, protests or litigation. In the UK think tanks influence policy debates and can be supported by private donors or corporate funding; trade unions historically provided organisational capacity and financial support to Labour. In the US the development of Political Action Committees (PACs) and Super PACs channels large amounts of money into campaigns, often as independent expenditures rather than direct contributions to candidates. The phenomenon of "iron triangles" — stable relationships among bureaucrats, legislators and interest groups — remains a way to understand policy influence, though modern lobbying networks are more fluid. Students should weigh the democratic benefits of organised advocacy against concerns that resource-rich interests gain outsized influence, and reflect on mechanisms such as disclosure rules and limits on direct contributions designed to manage these tensions.

## Case studies: Brexit and contemporary American campaigns
The 2016 UK EU referendum and recent US presidential campaigns provide vivid examples of how funding and campaigning interact. The Brexit campaign saw high-profile spending by both Leave and Remain groups, the use of social media for targeted persuasion, and controversies over data use and foreign influence. Campaigns brought together parties, business donors and grassroots activists in new coalitions, demonstrating how referendums mobilise resources across traditional party lines. In the USA, campaigns from 2008 onwards illustrate different money models: Obama’s emphasis on small donors and digital mobilisation contrasted with later campaigns that relied heavily on large donors, supercharged independent expenditure groups and sophisticated microtargeting. The post-Citizens United landscape allowed independent organisations to pour resources into battleground states, sometimes with opaque funding sources. Both case studies show that legal frameworks, media ecosystems and technological capability together determine who can shape the political agenda and how.

## Ongoing debates and reform proposals
Public debate over party funding and campaigning centers on transparency, equality of political voice and the prevention of undue influence. Proposals range from tighter disclosure rules and bans on certain types of donations to public funding of parties and stricter regulation of online political advertising. In the UK, critics argue for greater transparency and clearer rules on permissible donors and recallable penalties for breaches. In the US, ideas include strengthening the FEC, closing gaps created by judicial decisions, and requiring clearer disclosure of donors to independent groups. Reform discussions also consider the democratic trade-offs: public funding can reduce reliance on wealthy donors but may entrench established parties; stricter limits can curb excesses yet drive spending into less-regulated channels. For students, it is important to evaluate reforms by asking whether they increase accountability, enhance representation, and are feasible within constitutional and political constraints.

## Exam technique
When answering A-level Politics questions on parties, funding and campaigning, start by making precise definitions and situating the question in its institutional context. For shorter "explain" questions aim to develop at least three linked points with evidence: identify a mechanism (for example, how FPTP concentrates spending in marginals), explain the causal link, and support it with a British or American example. For 25-mark essays and extract-based questions plan a balanced structure before writing: introduce relevant concepts and outline your approach, develop sustained analysis combining AO1 knowledge with AO2 explanation and AO3 evaluation, and conclude with a clear judgement. In comparative questions explicitly draw similarities and differences between the UK and the USA, referencing institutional explanations (electoral system, party organisation, regulatory framework) and illustrating points with concrete case studies such as Brexit, Citizens United/Campaign finance changes, Obama’s small-donor model, or the role of trade unions in Labour history. Use precise political vocabulary, integrate examples throughout rather than tacking them on at the end, and make synoptic links to other parts of the course (for instance, how media influence, judicial rulings or devolution can affect party strategy). Time-manage by allocating around 10–15 minutes planning for a 25-mark essay, and always check that each paragraph advances your argument toward a reasoned conclusion.
