# UK Judiciary & Supreme Court: judicial review (A-level Politics Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## The role and composition of the UK judiciary and the Supreme Court
The UK judiciary is the body of judges and courts that interprets and applies the law. At its apex sits the Supreme Court, created in 2009 to take over the judicial functions previously exercised by the House of Lords. The Supreme Court hears the most significant points of law affecting the constitution, human rights and public policy, and its judgments set binding precedents for lower courts. Below the Supreme Court, the court system includes the Court of Appeal, the High Court (with its divisional courts), and a range of specialist tribunals. Judges are expected to bring legal expertise, impartiality and reasoned judgment to disputes, whether private law disputes or challenges to decisions taken by public bodies. The judiciary’s practical role in the constitution is therefore twofold: resolving individual disputes and supervising the lawfulness of government action through judicial review.

## Judicial independence and the separation of powers
A stable, independent judiciary is a core element of the UK constitution. Independence is protected in a number of practical ways: security of tenure for senior judges (they can be removed only by an address of both Houses of Parliament), protection of pay, and institutional arrangements that limit executive interference in judicial decision-making. Judicial independence underpins public confidence that disputes will be decided on legal grounds rather than political preference. This sits alongside the doctrine of separation of powers: although the UK does not have the rigid separation found in some written constitutions, there are clear institutional separations between Parliament (legislative), the government (executive) and the courts (judicial). Those separations create the context in which judicial review operates as a legal check on executive power and as a means of upholding the rule of law.

## Judicial review: grounds, tests and remedies
Judicial review is the process by which courts examine the lawfulness of actions, decisions and policies made by public bodies. It is not a re-hearing of the merits of a policy; rather, it looks at whether power has been exercised lawfully. The main grounds for judicial review are illegality, procedural impropriety (including breaches of natural justice), and irrationality. Illegality captures actions taken beyond the legal power (“ultra vires”) of the decision-maker or taken in bad faith. Procedural impropriety covers failures to give a fair hearing or to observe rules against bias. Irrationality is often expressed through the Wednesbury test: a decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have reached it.

Since the Human Rights Act 1998 and under the influence of European Union law while the UK was a member, proportionality has become an increasingly important standard. Proportionality requires that a measure pursues a legitimate aim, is suitable to achieve that aim, is necessary (no less intrusive alternative), and strikes a fair balance between competing interests. Proportionality tends to be a more structured and interventionist test than Wednesbury irrationality and is widely used in rights-challenges.

Remedies in judicial review are flexible. The court may quash an unlawful decision, issue prohibiting or mandatory orders to stop or require action, grant declarations about the legal position, or award injunctions and sometimes damages. Importantly, UK courts cannot normally “strike down” primary legislation passed by Parliament. If a statute conflicts with the European Convention on Human Rights, under the Human Rights Act a court may issue a declaration of incompatibility, which draws political rather than legal consequences and invites Parliament to consider legislative change.

## Appointment, accountability and the Judicial Appointments Commission
The process for appointing judges is designed to promote merit, fairness and independence. The Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC), established in 2005, advertises vacancies, selects candidates through competitive procedures and makes recommendations for most judicial appointments. The Lord Chancellor retains a formal role, including a power to accept or reject a recommended candidate in limited circumstances, but the JAC’s role has reduced the perception of politicised appointments. Senior judicial roles, such as Justices of the Supreme Court, are selected through panels that include judicial and lay members. Although judges are independent in decision-making, they are accountable through transparent published judgments, the possibility of appeal to higher courts, and parliamentary scrutiny of the judiciary’s administration (not its decisions). Removal is deliberately difficult to protect judicial independence: judges may be removed only by an address of both Houses of Parliament, a high threshold that guards against executive retaliation.

## How judicial review affects government and Parliament: limits and interactions
Judicial review functions as a legal check on the executive. By declaring unlawful conduct, quashing maladministration or requiring procedural fairness, courts can force government to change policies or reverse decisions. This influence can be significant even if courts do not substitute their own policy preferences for those of the elected branches; a finding of illegality can be politically embarrassing and operationally constraining for ministers. Courts also interact with Parliament in subtler ways: they interpret statutes that define the scope of executive power, they apply human rights obligations where Parliament has incorporated them, and—when compatible—they have in the past given effect to EU law in preference to conflicting domestic legislation. However, the courts are careful to respect parliamentary sovereignty and democratic accountability, which is why remedies are framed in legal language and why courts avoid making policy themselves.

## Landmark cases that illustrate judicial review in action
Several high-profile cases demonstrate the constitutional role of the courts. The Factortame litigation in the 1990s showed the power of domestic courts to set aside national measures that conflicted with EU law while the UK was in the EU; the case remains a classic illustration of judicial willingness to constrain executive and parliamentary action under a higher legal order. The Supreme Court’s ruling in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (2017) established that the government could not use prerogative powers to trigger withdrawal from the EU without parliamentary authorization, reinforcing parliamentary sovereignty and requiring parliamentary involvement in a major constitutional step. In 2019, the Supreme Court in R (Miller) (the prorogation case) held that the prime minister’s advice to the monarch to prorogue Parliament for a prolonged period was unlawful because it frustrated the constitutional role of Parliament; the court therefore quashed the prorogation. In A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department (the Belmarsh case, 2004) the courts found that indefinite detention of foreign nationals without trial was incompatible with human rights obligations, producing legislative and policy change. More recent examples include R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor (2017), in which the Supreme Court held that employment tribunal fees preventing access to justice were unlawful; and R (Evans) v Attorney General (2015), where the Supreme Court refused to allow a ministerial veto over disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, reinforcing judicial oversight of executive claims to privilege.

These cases show different judicial tools: interpreting statutes, reviewing prerogative powers, applying human rights tests, and ordering remedies. They also exemplify how judicial review can have significant political and constitutional effects without transforming courts into policy-makers.

## Debates and political significance: judicial activism, legitimacy and reform
The increasing visibility of the Supreme Court in constitutional disputes has provoked debate. Supporters argue that judicial review protects individual rights, enforces limits on executive power and upholds the rule of law, particularly in moments when political branches are under stress. Critics sometimes accuse the judiciary of “activism” or of deciding issues that ought to be resolved politically, claiming that judges lack democratic legitimacy. A related concern is the possible politicisation of appointment processes or of judges adopting values-based interpretations rather than neutral application of law.

These debates have practical consequences: governments and commentators periodically propose reforms to limit judicial review, alter remedies, or change appointment procedures. Such proposals raise complex trade-offs between democratic responsiveness, the protection of rights, legal certainty and the independence of the courts. In practice, courts tend to be cautious; judicial review outcomes are usually framed in narrow legal terms and judges frequently emphasize their modest institutional role, deferring to Parliament on questions of broad policy while insisting on legality, reasoned decision-making and procedural fairness.

## Teaching points and clarifications useful for revision
When studying judicial review, it helps to keep a few clarifying principles in mind. First, distinguish between primary legislation (Acts of Parliament) and secondary or delegated legislation (regulations, orders, statutory instruments). Courts cannot normally invalidate primary legislation, though they can disapply secondary legislation and quash administrative decisions. Second, understand the difference between the Wednesbury irrationality standard (very deferential) and proportionality (a structured rights-focused test); proportionality became more prominent with human rights and EU influences. Third, appreciate that judicial review is about the lawfulness of decision-making, not the wisdom of policy; judges correct legal error, not political judgment. Fourth, remember the variety of remedies: quashing orders, prohibitions, mandatories, declarations and injunctions, each with different practical effects. Finally, be able to explain how high-profile cases affected the balance of power among the branches of government and prompted political or legislative responses.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the judiciary and judicial review, begin by defining key terms clearly—for example, explain what judicial review, ultra vires and proportionality mean in context. Use the question’s command word: if asked to “analyse,” break the issue into distinct legal tests or institutional effects; if asked to “evaluate,” weigh arguments for and against judicial intervention and reach a reasoned conclusion. Anchor answers in legal doctrine and constitutional principles: use parliamentary sovereignty, rule of law and separation of powers as analytic tools. Illustrate points with relevant examples and cases; summarise the facts briefly, explain the legal principle the case established and link back to the question. Where appropriate, compare the UK position with distinct arrangements (for example, the US power to strike down primary legislation) to show awareness of alternative models. In 25-mark essays, sustain a balanced argument, develop at least three substantive points with evidence, engage with counter-arguments, and finish with a clear conclusion that answers the question directly. Practice applying legal concepts to contemporary controversies and prepare brief case-study paragraphs on Miller, Factortame, Belmarsh and UNISON so you can deploy them accurately under exam conditions.
