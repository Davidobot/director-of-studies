# US Constitution, federalism and separation of powers (A-level Politics Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: why the Constitution matters
The United States Constitution is the written foundation for American government and politics. It sets out the structure of national institutions, allocates powers between branches and between the national and state governments, and establishes fundamental principles such as the rule of law, limited government and the protection of individual rights. Despite being over two centuries old, the Constitution remains a living framework: it is interpreted by the Supreme Court, adapted through political practice and, rarely, formally amended. For A‑level study it is important to see the Constitution not as a dry legal text but as the organising logic behind everyday politics — from how a bill becomes law to why presidents can use executive orders, why Congress can investigate an administration, and why states have substantial discretion over education and criminal justice.

## The nature and significance of the US Constitution
Unlike the United Kingdom’s uncodified and largely parliamentary constitution, the US Constitution is codified: a single written document that begins with a short list of articles and is complemented by amendments such as the Bill of Rights. Its opening articles establish the three branches of government and their core competences. A central idea is constitutional supremacy: the Constitution is the highest law. The supremacy clause and the system of judicial review give the Supreme Court the authority to interpret the meaning of the Constitution and to invalidate acts of Congress or state laws that conflict with it. The document embeds both broad principles and specific mechanisms: it creates separation of powers, checks and balances, a federal system, and a complex amendment process. Students should understand that the Constitution's brevity is intentional; many details are left vague on purpose so that political practice, legislation and courts fill in the gaps. This flexibility explains why debates about the Constitution’s contemporary relevance — for instance over civil liberties, executive power or federal reach — remain central to American politics.

## Separation of powers and checks and balances
Separation of powers is the constitutional principle that divides governmental functions among the legislature, the executive and the judiciary so that no single branch can dominate. Checks and balances are the practical tools that keep those powers in tension: Congress makes laws and controls the purse, the president implements and enforces laws and can veto legislation, and the Supreme Court interprets laws and can declare them unconstitutional. In practice this creates a system of mutual oversight rather than absolute independence. For example, the president nominates federal judges and cabinet members but the Senate must give advice and consent; Congress can impeach and remove a president or judge; and the Court, through judicial review established in Marbury v. Madison, can strike down legislation or executive acts it finds unconstitutional. The balance of power between branches has shifted over time. Periods of strong presidential leadership — such as Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal era — have been followed by periods of legislative or judicial assertion. Understanding how these checks operate, when they succeed or fail, and why they matter for democratic accountability is central to A‑level analysis.

## Federalism and state–federal relations
Federalism divides sovereignty between the national government and the states. The Constitution lists certain enumerated powers for Congress while reserving all other powers to the states via the Tenth Amendment. Over American history, the balance between national and state power has oscillated. Early disputes about implied powers led to landmark decisions such as McCulloch v. Maryland, which affirmed broad federal authority under the necessary and proper clause. The New Deal era greatly expanded federal action, often under the Commerce Clause, while later reformers promoted “new federalism” to return responsibilities to states. Contemporary federalism is a patchwork: some policy areas, like monetary policy and national defence, are clearly federal; others, such as education or policing, remain primarily state responsibilities. Court cases and congressional statutes have sometimes nationalised issues (for example civil rights legislation), while states retain discretion over elections, criminal sentencing and public health measures. Federalism is therefore both a structural principle and a source of political conflict, visible in debates over healthcare, environmental regulation, and the regulation of firearms.

## The three branches in practice: Congress, the Presidency and the Supreme Court
Constitutional design gives each branch distinct powers, but the way those powers work in practice depends on institutions and political context. Congress is a bicameral legislature with the House of Representatives designed for responsiveness (shorter terms, proportional representation) and the Senate for stability and state representation (longer terms, equal representation for states). Its committee system shapes legislation, oversight and the allocation of resources; party leadership and whips influence voting behaviour; and the power of the purse and confirmation process are significant checks on the executive. The presidency combines formal constitutional powers, such as commander-in-chief and treaty-making (subject to Senate approval), with substantial informal powers: agenda-setting, crisis leadership, and use of executive orders and national security directives. Debates about the “imperial” or “imperilled” presidency highlight tensions between unilateral action and institutional constraint. The Supreme Court stands at the apex of the judiciary with life-tenured justices whose interpretations can transform public policy. Landmark rulings from Brown v. Board of Education to Roe v. Wade and more recent decisions concerning gun rights or same-sex marriage demonstrate the Court’s capacity to shape social and political life. For revision, link constitutional powers to contemporary examples: investigate how Congress used oversight during major scandals, how presidents have used executive authority in wartime or emergency, and how Court rulings have redefined liberties and federal–state relations.

## Amendment process, rights and judicial review
The Constitution can be formally changed by the amendment process in Article V, which requires supermajorities in Congress and ratification by the states — a deliberately difficult route that makes formal amendments rare. Most constitutional change has therefore come through judicial interpretation, political practice, statutes and cultural shifts. The first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, enshrine civil liberties and were initially applied only against the federal government; subsequent incorporation via the Fourteenth Amendment extended most protections to state actions as well. Judicial review allows the Supreme Court to interpret these guarantees, and its philosophy — whether strict constructionist or more activist — influences outcomes. Landmark rulings have had profound effects beyond legal doctrine: Brown dismantled de jure segregation, Miranda created procedural safeguards in criminal justice, United States v. Nixon curtailed executive privilege, and Obergefell recognised same-sex marriage nationwide. Students should be able to explain how judicial doctrine, appointment politics, and broader social movements interplay to produce lasting constitutional change.

## Comparative perspective with the UK system
Comparing the US constitutional system with the UK’s uncodified, parliamentary system clarifies the significance of separation of powers and federalism. The UK’s executive is fused with Parliament: the prime minister is a member of the legislature and derives authority from party support and parliamentary confidence, whereas the US president is separately elected and not accountable to Congress in the same way. The UK’s constitutional sovereignty of Parliament means courts cannot strike down primary legislation, while the US Supreme Court can invalidate federal and state laws that conflict with the Constitution. Federalism contrasts with the UK’s unitary state and recent devolution: US states enjoy constitutionally guaranteed powers, whereas devolved bodies in the UK have powers delegated by Parliament and can, in theory, be altered by it. These contrasts help explain different political dynamics: in the US, divided government and inter-branch conflict are common; in the UK, the executive’s dominance of the legislature — subject to party discipline — has historically produced stronger government control over the agenda. When answering comparative questions, focus on the constitutional roots of these differences and use examples to show their practical consequences.

## Exam technique
To succeed in A‑level questions on the US Constitution, federalism and separation of powers, begin answers with clear definitions of the key concepts: what is a codified constitution, what separation of powers means, and what federalism entails. Use terminology accurately and link institutional rules to political outcomes: for example, explain how Senate confirmation powers influence judicial interpretation or how the electoral college shapes presidential campaigns. For 9‑mark questions, make three well-explained and distinct points, each illustrated with a concrete example (a case, an event or a statute) and show their significance. For 25‑mark essays, structure a balanced argument that weighs competing perspectives, draws on both theory and examples, and reaches a reasoned conclusion. In comparative questions make explicit contrasts and similarities and explain how constitutional structure generates different political behaviour in the UK and the USA. Always integrate named cases (such as Marbury, McCulloch, Brown or United States v. Nixon), landmark legislation, and presidential examples (such as FDR’s New Deal or Nixon’s Watergate) to substantiate claims. Finally, practice synoptic writing by linking constitutional principles to political processes — elections, party politics, civil rights campaigns — and ensure each paragraph advances your argument so that examiners can follow a coherent, evidence‑based line of reasoning.
