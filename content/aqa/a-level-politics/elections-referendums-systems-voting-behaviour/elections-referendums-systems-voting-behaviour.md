# Elections and referendums: systems and voting behaviour (A-level Politics Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction
Elections and referendums are the mechanisms by which democratic choice is expressed, leaders are authorised, policies gain legitimacy and constitutional change is tested. At A-level you will need to understand not only the mechanics of different electoral systems but also how those systems shape party competition, representation and government formation. You will also need to explain why people vote as they do: which long-term social structures and which short-term events influence electoral behaviour. Throughout, use concrete UK examples — and where useful comparisons help explain effects, draw on other systems such as the devolved assemblies and the United States.

## Electoral systems in the UK: mechanics and variety
The UK uses a variety of systems depending on the contest. The House of Commons is elected by First Past the Post (FPTP): each constituency elects one MP, and the candidate with the most votes wins. FPTP produces single-member constituencies, a strong constituency link and clear winners, but it also creates “wasted” votes and can exaggerate majorities. Devolved legislatures use different methods: the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd use the Additional Member System (AMS), which combines constituency FPTP seats with regional party list seats to produce a more proportional outcome, while the Northern Ireland Assembly and local government elections there use the Single Transferable Vote (STV), a preferential system that allows votes to be transferred according to voter preferences. National referendums and some mayoral contests have used the Supplementary Vote (SV) or simple majorities, depending on the rules applied.

Each system has trade-offs. FPTP tends to produce clear outcomes and single-party governments, which supporters argue aids accountability and stable policymaking. Proportional systems reward parties in line with their national vote share, often producing coalition or minority governments and reflecting a broader range of political voices. Preference systems such as STV reduce the number of wasted votes and allow voters to express second and subsequent choices, while regional lists can boost smaller parties but weaken the constituency link. Understanding these mechanisms is essential when you assess electoral outcomes, campaign strategies and debates about reform.

## Effects of systems on party systems and representation
Electoral systems shape the party system through incentives they create for voters and parties. FPTP favours large, regionally concentrated parties and tends to marginalise smaller, evenly spread parties. The 2015 general election is a clear example: UKIP secured a significant share of the national vote but won only a single seat because their support was spread thinly across constituencies. By contrast, the Scottish National Party’s concentrated support in Scotland translated into many more seats than their national vote share might suggest.

Proportional systems encourage multi-party competition because even smaller parties can win seats if they reach thresholds in regions or across lists. This leads to coalition governments or formal agreements, as seen at devolved level where AMS has produced both single-party majorities in some years and coalitions in others. Preference voting systems such as STV can reduce polarisation by rewarding centre appeals and promoting inter-party transfers. The choice of system therefore affects not only who gets elected but also party strategy: whether to emphasise broad national appeal, target safe seats, encourage tactical voting, or build local networks.

Electoral systems also influence representation in terms of gender, ethnicity and minority interests. Proportional and list systems often facilitate more diverse candidate lists and more opportunities for under-represented groups to reach legislatures, while single-member districts sometimes perpetuate incumbency and the dominance of established parties. These structural effects are central to debates about democratic fairness and legitimacy.

## Voting behaviour: long-term social structures and short-term influences
Explaining why people vote as they do involves several overlapping theories. The sociological approach emphasises long-term social structures: class, religion, region and ethnicity have historically produced strong party attachments. In the mid-20th century class was a dominant predictor of voting, but long-term realignment and partisan dealignment have weakened some of these ties. The decline in traditional class voting, the rise of issue politics, greater social mobility and changing media consumption have all contributed to a more fluid electorate.

The party identification model argues that psychological attachment to a party remains important for many voters, but it coexists with “floating” voters who make choices based on short-term factors. Rational choice and valence models focus on voters’ assessment of parties’ competence on key issues such as the economy or health. When voters perceive an incumbent government as competent on valence issues, they are more likely to support it regardless of ideological alignment.

Short-term influences include leadership perception, campaign events, media coverage and salient issues. Leadership matters when voters make judgement calls about competence and trustworthiness; Tony Blair’s personal appeal and “New Labour” modernisation were crucial in 1997, while perceptions of Conservative competence on the economy helped Margaret Thatcher in 1979. Campaigns and the media shape issue salience and frame political debates; social media has intensified the speed and reach of campaigning and can amplify niche issues or targeted messages.

Tactical voting is a practical response to FPTP incentives: where a voter’s preferred party is unlikely to win, they may back a less preferred but more viable candidate to prevent an undesirable outcome. Turnout is another behaviour that matters. Turnout varies across elections and types of contest. Higher turnouts are often associated with close contests, high-stakes referendums or strong mobilisation; lower turnouts tend to occur in low-salience local elections or when voters feel alienated. Young people have tended to vote less than older cohorts, though this is dynamic and issue-specific (for instance, younger voters were more likely to support Remain in the 2016 EU referendum).

## Referendums: purpose, politics and UK examples
Referendums are a form of direct democracy used to decide specific issues. They can provide a clear mandate for constitutional or policy changes and allow governments to share or shift responsibility for difficult decisions. However, referendums are not neutral devices: the way questions are phrased, the timing of a vote, campaign finance rules and turnout thresholds all matter to outcomes and legitimacy.

The UK has used referendums for major constitutional choices, including the 1975 referendum on continued membership of the European Economic Community, the 1998 devolution referendums that established the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, the 2011 AV referendum on electoral reform, the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and the 2016 EU membership referendum (Brexit). These examples show different purposes and impacts. The Scottish referendum was a high-turnout, binding constitutional test that settled the question of independence for a generation. The 2011 AV referendum produced a low turnout and a decisive rejection of electoral reform. The 2016 EU referendum delivered a narrow and deeply consequential result to leave, reshaping British politics, triggering leadership changes, and provoking debates about representative versus direct democracy.

Referendums can also polarise societies and simplify complex policy issues into binary choices. They may constrain future policy flexibility and create tensions between direct mandates and parliamentary sovereignty. When assessing referendums, consider legitimacy, mandate strength (which depends on turnout and the margin), the subsequent political management of the result, and how campaigns framed the debate.

## Case study elections: 1979, 1997 and 2015
A detailed understanding of a few key elections helps illustrate how systems and behaviour interact. The 1979 general election marked a turning point: it followed the “Winter of Discontent”, widespread strikes and a perception of economic decline under the Labour government. Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives won a decisive victory, and the election ushered in a shift towards free-market policies and a realignment of British politics around issues of monetarism, union power and individualism. FPTP amplified the Conservative win and allowed for a clear single-party government able to implement radical policy changes.

The 1997 general election is the classic modern landslide. After years of Conservative government and scandals, Labour under Tony Blair presented “New Labour”: a rebranded, centrist platform that appealed to middle-class and traditional working-class voters alike. The result was a substantial parliamentary majority for Labour and a long period of single-party rule. Leadership, media management, and a unifying manifesto combined with public desire for change explain the outcome. FPTP translated broad national swing into a large parliamentary majority.

The 2015 general election demonstrates the distortions of FPTP in the era of multiple significant parties. The Conservatives won a parliamentary majority with just over a third of the national vote, Labour’s vote share declined slightly, UKIP won a significant share of the vote but only a single seat, and the SNP converted concentrated regional support in Scotland into a very large number of seats. The result emphasised how geographic concentration of support and the electoral system determine representation. The 2015 outcome fed debates about fairness, the rise of minor parties, and the pressures toward coalition or constitutional reform.

Studying these elections helps you link short-term factors (leadership, economic conditions, campaign strategies) to long-term structural factors (class realignment, regional identities) and to the constraints and incentives created by the electoral system.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on elections and referendums you must balance accurate factual knowledge with analysis and evaluation. For short to medium questions (for example 9-mark “explain” questions) aim to develop at least three clear analytical points, each supported by specific evidence or examples, and written concisely with relevant political vocabulary. For 25-mark extract-based questions focus first on comprehension: briefly paraphrase the argument in the extract, identify its assumptions, and then use your knowledge to analyse and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of that argument. Structure your answer so that it offers a balanced discussion and finishes with a reasoned conclusion. For 25-mark essays you should plan before writing: introduce the issue and define key terms, present a structured line of argument with developed points and evidence, engage with counter-arguments, and end with a clear judgement that weighs competing claims.

Always link theory to evidence. When explaining effects of electoral systems use concrete examples such as UK general elections, devolved elections under AMS or STV, UKIP’s 2015 vote-seat mismatch, SNP seat concentration, or referendum outcomes like 2014 and 2016. Show synoptic understanding by drawing connections across the specification: link systems to party behaviour, party funding, pressure group influence and constitutional issues. Time-manage by allocating roughly one minute per mark for longer answers and build in time to plan and check your final paragraph or conclusion. Use precise political vocabulary (for example “proportionality”, “tactical voting”, “valence issues”, “partisan dealignment”), and avoid unsupported assertion by always following a claim with an example or reasoning. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions and annotate model answers to internalise what examiners expect in terms of balance, evidence and evaluation.
