# Parliament: structure, scrutiny and legislation (A-level Politics Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Parliament’s constitutional role and powers
Parliament sits at the heart of the UK’s uncodified constitution. It is the supreme law-making body: Parliament enacts primary legislation, scrutinises the work of government and, in principle, can override other sources of authority. Parliamentary sovereignty means that no other body can permanently bind a later Parliament or override an Act of Parliament; courts interpret and apply law but cannot strike down Acts. At the same time, the constitution of the UK is made up of statutes, common law, conventions, authoritative texts and the royal prerogative, and Parliament operates within that mix. Parliamentary privilege gives MPs and peers freedom of speech in debates and protection from civil action for things said in the course of parliamentary proceedings; this enables frank scrutiny and exposes wrongdoing, but it is exercised within political and legal limits.

## The two Houses: composition and distinct roles
The UK Parliament is bicameral, formed of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, with the Sovereign giving Royal Assent as the formal final step in law-making. The House of Commons is the elected chamber. MPs represent constituencies, introduce and debate legislation, and—because the government is drawn from it—it is the principal arena in which the executive is held to account. The House of Lords is an unelected revising chamber composed of life peers appointed for their expertise, bishops, and a small number of hereditary peers who remain following the reforms of 1999. The Lords’ primary constitutional role is scrutiny and revision; the chamber examines bills in detail, proposes amendments and offers specialist voices often drawn from professional, academic and civic backgrounds. The two Houses differ in legitimacy, powers and methods: the Commons has primacy on financial matters and the power to override the Lords in most circumstances through the Parliament Acts, while the Lords can delay and revise but not ultimately veto most government legislation.

## How legislation is made and the stages where Parliament matters
A bill can start in either House (except money bills, which normally start in the Commons) and passes a sequence of stages: first reading, second reading where principles are debated, committee stage for detailed line-by-line scrutiny, report stage for further amendment, and third reading for final approval. If the second House amends a bill, it returns to the originating House and may pass back and forth in "ping‑pong" until agreement is reached; in exceptional cases the Commons can invoke the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 to pass legislation without the Lords’ consent if the Lords repeatedly delay. Bills fall into types—public, private, hybrid and private members’ bills—and each type travels through the same formal stages, though private members’ bills face stricter time constraints and require cross-party support to succeed. Parliament’s opportunity to shape legislation is greatest at the committee and report stages, where detailed proposals and technical corrections are made; examples of significant laws originating or being advanced through private members’ bills include the 1967 Abortion Act, which shows how backbench initiatives can sometimes change policy.

## Mechanisms of scrutiny: formal tools and their limits
Parliamentary scrutiny of the executive takes many forms, from daily exchanges in debates to sustained inquiries. Prime Minister’s Questions provides a high-profile weekly forum in the Commons for brief, adversarial exchanges with the Prime Minister; urgent questions, ministerial statements and Oral Questions allow ministers to be required to explain particular issues. Select Committees are a key mechanism for in-depth scrutiny: they examine policy, expenditure and administration, take evidence from ministers, experts and civil servants, and publish reports that can shape public debate and influence government decisions. The Backbench Business Committee and increased opportunities for opposition day debates and adjournment debates give non-government MPs time to raise issues.

Despite these tools, parliamentary scrutiny faces constraints. Party discipline means government whips can usually secure votes in line with the executive’s agenda, particularly where the governing party has a strong majority. The government controls much of the parliamentary timetable through the Leader of the House, which limits the time available for detailed debate on some measures. While select committees have gained independence and visibility—reforms in the 2000s established elected chairs and altered membership allocation—their recommendations are not binding; governments can accept, ignore or partially implement them. The practical effect of scrutiny is therefore shaped by political context: a hung Parliament, a small majority, or strong public pressure all increase Parliament’s capacity to influence policy, while large majorities and tight control of business reduce it.

## Representation, behaviour and influence of MPs and peers
MPs balance several roles: they act as constituency representatives dealing with local casework and concerns, legislators shaping national policy, and party actors who support or oppose their party’s programme. Theories of representation provide contrasting expectations of MPs’ behaviour. The trustee model, associated with Edmund Burke, suggests MPs should use their judgement to make decisions for the long‑term good; the delegate model expects MPs to reflect the direct wishes of their constituents; the mandate model emphasises fidelity to the party platform on which an MP was elected. In practice most MPs move between these roles depending on the issue, electoral pressure and personal beliefs. Party whips and the incentives of ministerial office or committee positions encourage collective party behaviour and usually ensure government reliability in votes, but rebellions and conscience votes occur when MPs prioritise constituency opinion, principle or personal conviction. Peers, while unelected, often exert influence through specialist knowledge and detailed amendment, and their independence can make the Lords an effective revising chamber although questions about democratic legitimacy remain.

## Committees, inquiry work and parliamentary influence in practice
Select committees have become one of Parliament’s most visible successes in holding government to account. Committees such as the Treasury Committee, Public Accounts Committee and departmental select committees publish investigations that expose policy failures, request documents and call senior figures to give oral evidence. Reforms introduced since 2009—most notably the Wright Committee recommendations—sought to strengthen select committees by electing their chairs and reducing the executive’s control over membership, improving their legitimacy and autonomy. Committees can shape policy through sustained media attention and detailed recommendations; for example, sustained inquiry work can force government u-turns, generate new legislation or influence long-term policy. Nevertheless, committees depend on public interest, media amplification and cross-party consensus to maximise their leverage, and they cannot compel government action beyond naming and shaming or persuasion.

## Parliament and other branches: interaction, overlap and constitutional dynamics
Parliament does not operate in isolation: it interacts with the executive, the judiciary, devolved legislatures and, in recent memory, supranational institutions. The executive dominates the Commons by virtue of its ability to command a majority and set the legislative agenda, yet Parliament provides legal authority for government action. The judiciary can interpret legislation and review executive actions where they breach statutory limits or constitutional principles, creating a dialogue between courts and Parliament rather than a hierarchy. Devolution has redistributed legislative responsibilities to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, changing the scope of Westminster’s authority and producing new arenas for scrutiny. Parliament’s relationship with external actors—pressure groups, think tanks, the media and civic organisations—also shapes legislative and scrutiny outcomes, with strong campaigns sometimes driving debate in Westminster and prompting legislative change.

## Reform, strengths and weaknesses: an evaluative overview
Parliament’s strengths lie in its democratic legitimacy through elected MPs, its constitutional centrality, and its capacity to combine political judgment with detailed scrutiny. Recent reforms have made Parliament more plural and more assertive in places: the election of select committee chairs, the Backbench Business Committee, changes to the House of Lords and the introduction of recall procedures have all altered the balance of power incrementally. At the same time, Parliament’s weaknesses are persistent: executive dominance through party discipline and control of parliamentary time can limit effective challenge; the unelected nature of the Lords raises questions of democratic legitimacy despite its revising skill; and the lack of a written constitution sometimes leaves boundaries and conventions open to dispute. Whether Parliament acts as an effective check therefore depends on the party arithmetic of the moment, the quality of institutional reforms, and the broader political culture in which Parliament operates.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Parliament, structure your answers to show knowledge, analysis and evaluation. For short 'explain' questions, define the concept clearly and follow with two or three developed points, each supported by a brief example or consequence. For 25-mark essays, start with a concise introduction that outlines your interpretation of the question and your line of argument. Use the middle paragraphs to develop a balanced discussion: explain the relevant institutional features (composition, powers, procedures), analyse how they operate in practice (give contemporary or historical examples, such as the use of the Parliament Acts, select committee inquiries or high-profile rebellions), and evaluate strengths and weaknesses, making comparisons where appropriate. Finish with a clear conclusion that answers the question directly and weighs the evidence. Throughout, use appropriate political vocabulary (for example, 'parliamentary sovereignty', 'backbenchers', 'select committees', 'whips', 'ping‑pong') and signpost your argument so the examiner can follow your reasoning. Where the question asks for comparisons or synoptic knowledge, bring in relevant links to other topics—executive power, judicial review or devolution—to demonstrate your wider understanding.
