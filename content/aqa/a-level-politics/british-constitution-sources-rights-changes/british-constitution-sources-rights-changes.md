# British constitution: sources, rights and changes (A-level Politics Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What is the British constitution and why does it matter?
The British constitution is the set of rules, principles and practices that organise how the state is governed. Unlike a single written document, the UK constitution is uncodified: it draws on multiple sources — statutes passed by Parliament, judicial decisions (common law), political conventions, authoritative texts and the royal prerogative. This flexibility is often presented as a strength because it allows adaptation without the need for formal amendment procedures. At the same time, the absence of a single constitutional text raises questions about clarity, protection of rights and the limits of government power. Understanding the constitution is central to explaining how political power is exercised in the UK, how rights are protected or constrained, and why certain debates — over devolution, judicial power, or the role of Parliament — are ongoing.

## The main sources: statutes, common law, conventions, prerogative and authoritative works
Statute law is the most visible source: Acts of Parliament such as the Human Rights Act, the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (2011) and the Scotland Act (1998) alter constitutional arrangements in plain language. Common law, developed through judges’ decisions, fills gaps and protects individual liberties through doctrines such as habeas corpus and the growth of judicial review. Conventions are non-legal rules that govern political behaviour: collective ministerial responsibility, the Salisbury Convention in the House of Lords, and the expectation that the monarch gives royal assent are examples. The royal prerogative historically conferred executive powers to the Crown; today those powers are exercised by ministers and cover areas such as treaty making, deployment of armed forces and the granting of honours. Finally, authoritative texts and guides — for example Erskine May and classic constitutional theorists — shape understanding and practice by setting out accepted procedures and principles. In combination these sources form a layered, living constitution.

## Historical landmarks that shaped rights and institutions
Several historical documents have had long-term influence on British constitutional development. The Magna Carta (1215) established early principles limiting arbitrary royal power and protecting certain legal rights, while the Bill of Rights (1689) clarified parliamentary supremacy against monarchical interference and set out civil liberties that influenced later liberal thought. The Act of Settlement (1701) regulated succession and judicial independence, and the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 limited the House of Lords’ ability to block Commons legislation. Each of these developments contributed to the shift from personal rule to parliamentary government and the gradual emergence of rights protections. More recently, statutes such as the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 have extended legal and practical protections, embedding new norms of rights and transparency into the constitutional framework.

## Constitutional change since 1997: devolution, rights and reform
The period since 1997 has seen significant constitutional transformation. The establishment of devolved institutions — the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly (now Senedd), and the Northern Ireland Assembly — redistributed legislative power and created an asymmetrical union in which different parts of the UK now possess different powers. The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, giving domestic courts a greater role in rights protection while leaving Parliament able to legislate contrary to rights where it chooses. The House of Lords Act 1999 removed most hereditary peers, changing the composition of the upper chamber and sparking continued debate about democratic legitimacy and possible further reform. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 improved access to government-held information and altered expectations of accountability. Later constitutional developments included the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act of 2011, intended to regularise election timing, and its repeal in 2022, which restored the prerogative power to dissolve Parliament in practice; this sequence illustrates how statutory experiments can be reversed. The referendum on EU membership and the subsequent Brexit process amount to perhaps the most profound constitutional reconfiguration of the twenty-first century, removing EU law supremacy and reshaping the relationship between the courts, Parliament and European institutions.

## Rights in the UK: protections and tensions
Rights in the UK are protected through a mixture of statute, common law and political practice. The Human Rights Act 1998 enabled individuals to rely on Convention rights in domestic courts and obliged public authorities to act compatibly with those rights, but it did not create an absolute hierarchy above Parliament. Judicial review allows courts to scrutinise the legality of public bodies’ acts and to check abuses of power, while common-law protections such as habeas corpus remain fundamental. However, rights protections have always been contested. Counter-terrorism legislation, emergency powers, surveillance laws and public order measures have provoked debates about the balance between collective security and individual liberties. The government’s ability to derogate from certain rights in times of emergency, or to rely on national security exemptions in freedom of information requests, highlights the tension between collective aims and individual protections. Public controversies — for example over detention, surveillance, or the limits of free speech — show how rights must be defended and articulated in political as well as legal arenas.

## Key tensions and debates: sovereignty, codification, courts and legitimacy
Several core debates animate study of the British constitution. Parliamentary sovereignty remains a foundational doctrine: Parliament can make or unmake any law and no Parliament can bind its successor. Yet this principle has been tested by other constitutional developments. EU membership created a practical tension by accepting EU law supremacy, a situation later resolved by withdrawal. The increasing role of judges through judicial review and the Human Rights Act challenges politicians who see an unelected judiciary as constraining democratic decisions; landmark cases, such as those ruling on the government’s use of prerogative powers, have sharpened this debate. Calls to codify the constitution reflect concerns about clarity and rights protection: proponents argue a written constitution would clarify relationships and entrench rights, while opponents warn against loss of flexibility and the elevation of judges as constitutional gatekeepers. Other important debates include reform of the House of Lords, the “English question” in relation to devolution and England-only policy matters, and the democratic status of referendums as a tool for constitutional change. Each issue requires weighing principles of democracy, accountability, legality and practicality.

## Examples to use in essays and analysis
Illustrative examples strengthen examination answers. The Factortame litigation demonstrated the practical impact of European law supremacy when domestic statute was disapplied by courts. The Miller cases are central to understanding the limits of prerogative power: the 2017 Miller judgment established that triggering Article 50 required parliamentary authorisation, and the 2019 prorogation ruling found that the Prime Minister’s advice to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it frustrated constitutional principles. The House of Lords Act 1999 and the creation of devolved legislatures from 1998 show how statute can re-shape institutions. The Human Rights Act’s role in cases concerning privacy, free expression and due process is an essential topic, as is the practical impact of the Freedom of Information Act in exposing misconduct and promoting transparency. Use these concrete examples to demonstrate knowledge, show causal connections and evaluate whether reforms have strengthened or weakened constitutional norms.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on the British constitution, begin by defining key terms clearly and succinctly: explain what is meant by an uncodified constitution, parliamentary sovereignty, judicial review or other relevant concepts. Use a short roadmap to structure your response and signpost where your argument is going. For 'explain' or 'describe' questions prioritise accurate AO1 knowledge with illustrative examples. For analysis and evaluation questions, move beyond description to consider competing arguments: present strengths and weaknesses, refer to real-world cases or statutes, and weigh principles such as democracy, rule of law and flexibility. Always integrate specific examples — landmark cases, Acts and reforms — to substantiate claims. In longer essays aim for a balanced argument that recognises nuance and reaches a reasoned judgement; avoid simply asserting opinions without justification. Remember the assessment objectives: show knowledge, analyse connections (for example how devolution affects parliamentary sovereignty), and evaluate consequences. Plan your time so you can draft a brief conclusion that summarises your judgement and links back to the question. Finally, write with clarity, use appropriate political vocabulary, and where relevant demonstrate synoptic understanding by drawing comparisons across different parts of the constitution (for example rights protections through court rulings versus political safeguards through Parliament).
