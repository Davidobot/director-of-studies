# US Congress, Presidency and elections: powers and checks (A-level Politics Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Constitutional foundations and the separation of powers
The US system is founded on a written Constitution that establishes separation of powers and checks and balances between the three branches of government. The framers deliberately divided power to prevent tyranny: Congress makes the laws, the President executes them, and the Supreme Court interprets them. Federalism further divides power between national and state governments. The Constitution provides clear, enumerated powers for Congress and for the President, but over time practice, political development and landmark court decisions have shaped how those powers actually operate. For students, it is important to distinguish the formal, text-based powers set out in Articles I–II from the ways in which presidents and legislatures have expanded or adapted their roles through custom, statute and institutional development. The amendment process and Supreme Court rulings can alter the practical balance, while events such as wars, economic crises and social movements often accelerate shifts in power.

## Congress: structure, powers and how it checks the presidency
Congress is bicameral, composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate, with different electoral rules, term lengths and constitutional responsibilities that produce different incentives and powers. Constitutionally, Congress has the power to legislate, declare war, control federal spending, regulate interstate commerce and oversee the executive. The House originates revenue bills and is more responsive to short-term public opinion because of two-year terms; the Senate provides longer-term deliberation, advice and consent on treaties and presidential appointments, and uses unique tools such as the filibuster to shape outcomes.

Congress checks the presidency through a variety of constitutional and institutional mechanisms. The power of the purse allows it to block or condition executive initiatives by refusing funds. The Senate’s advice and consent role permits it to accept or reject presidential nominees to the cabinet and federal judiciary, and to ratify or reject treaties. Impeachment in the House and trial in the Senate provide a formal, political route for removing a president or other federal officials, as seen in the impeachments of Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, and in the Nixon crisis that culminated in resignation before a likely impeachment. Congressional oversight occurs through hearings, subpoenas and investigations; famous examples include the Watergate hearings and the Iran-Contra investigations. Committees, which control much of the legislative agenda and investigative capacity, and party organisation, including the Speaker and party whips, shape how effectively Congress can exercise its checking powers, especially when one party controls both the White House and Congress or when government is divided.

## The presidency: formal powers, informal reach and practical limits
The President’s formal powers are set out in Article II and include commander-in-chief of the armed forces, chief executive with powers to appoint officials and enforce law, chief diplomat with authority to negotiate treaties (subject to Senate ratification), and veto power over legislation. Beyond these enumerated powers, presidents have developed extensive informal powers. The role of party leader, the “bully pulpit” of public communication, executive orders and executive agreements have all been used to set agendas and implement policy without new legislation. The creation of the Executive Office of the President and modern White House staffing practices have consolidated policy-making capacity in the presidency, a trend evident in the expansion of presidential influence during crises such as the New Deal or the Second World War.

Presidential power has limits as well as strengths. Constitutional checks—congressional legislation, control of spending, treaty ratification and confirmations—temper unilateral action. The Supreme Court can declare executive acts unconstitutional, as in United States v. Nixon (1974), which limited claims of absolute executive privilege. Political constraints such as public opinion, media scrutiny, party support in Congress and midterm elections affect a president’s capacity to pursue a programme. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 represents Congress’s attempt to curb unilateral presidential military commitments, though tensions over its efficacy persist. Students should be able to illustrate the dynamic nature of presidential power with examples that show episodes of expansion (Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal and wartime leadership; use of emergency powers) and contraction or challenge (Nixon’s loss of political legitimacy; limits imposed by a hostile Congress).

## The judiciary and judicial review as a check
The federal judiciary, culminating in the Supreme Court, plays a central constitutional role by interpreting the Constitution and federal law. Judicial review, established in Marbury v. Madison (1803), empowers courts to invalidate legislative and executive actions that conflict with the Constitution. The process of judicial selection—presidential nomination and Senate confirmation—makes the judiciary itself a site of political contestation, since the ideological composition of the Court influences how it checks the other branches. Debates about judicial activism versus judicial restraint, and between strict and loose constructionist approaches to constitutional interpretation, are central to understanding the Court’s influence on American politics.

Landmark rulings demonstrate the significance of the judiciary for policy and rights. Brown v. Board of Education (1954) reshaped race policy and civil rights; United States v. Nixon (1974) constrained executive privilege; and more recently Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) overruled Roe v. Wade (1973), illustrating how shifts in the Court’s composition can lead to major changes in constitutional protections. The judiciary thus serves both as a legal check on majoritarian action and as a political actor shaped by appointments and public response. Students should recognise that judicial authority depends on institutional legitimacy, enforcement capacity provided by the executive, and ongoing political debate.

## Elections, nomination processes and the Electoral College
Elections in the United States combine direct and indirect elements. Congressional elections use first-past-the-post single-member districts, producing a strong geographic link between representatives and constituencies and reinforcing a two-party system. Presidential elections are conducted indirectly through the Electoral College, where each state’s electors (equal to its congressional delegation) cast the decisive votes. The Electoral College can produce outcomes in which the winner of the national popular vote loses the presidency, as occurred in 2000 and 2016, making debates about its democratic legitimacy and effects on campaigning central to the study of US elections.

Candidate selection involves primaries, caucuses and national nominating conventions. Primaries have become the dominant route for selecting party nominees, shifting power from party elites to voters and activists in the states. The primary calendar, front-loading of early states and the differing rules between parties shape strategy. Campaigns increasingly depend on fundraising, media management and targeted messaging. Incumbency confers a strong advantage, reflected in high re-election rates for members of Congress and the ability of incumbents to use office resources and name recognition. Campaign finance underwent significant change after Citizens United (2010), which allowed corporations and unions to spend independently on political communication; the rise of Super PACs and other independent expenditure entities has amplified the role of money in elections. Students should be comfortable explaining how these institutional features influence electoral outcomes and how factors such as media, issues, candidate image and party coalitions interact in different eras.

## Political parties, pressure groups and the role of organised interests
The United States has been dominated by two parties, Democrats and Republicans, though internal factionalism and third-party candidacies periodically affect politics. Parties are weaker organisationally than many parliamentary counterparts; their limited control over nominations, especially through primaries, and the separation of powers create incentives for candidates and officeholders to cultivate personal constituencies and fundraising networks. Party polarisation since the late twentieth century has made partisan identity a primary organising principle in American politics, affecting legislative cooperation and the use of procedural tools such as the filibuster.

Pressure groups, advocacy organisations and Political Action Committees play central roles in American public life. Interest groups seek to influence policy through lobbying, campaign contributions, litigation and mobilising public opinion. The relationship between interest groups, congressional committees and federal agencies has been captured in the “iron triangle” concept, where stable networks can reinforce policy outcomes favourable to particular interests. Prominent examples include the National Rifle Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, and major business and labour organisations. The growth of outside spending and the proliferation of interest group money have intensified debates about influence, democracy and the balance between pluralist access and unequal influence.

## Civil rights and the interplay of law and politics
Civil rights and liberties in the United States have been shaped by constitutional text, political struggle and judicial interpretation. The Bill of Rights and later amendments set out protections, but their application and expansion have largely depended on social movements, legislative action and court rulings. The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, culminating in landmark legislation and Supreme Court decisions, illustrates how pressure from social movements combines with institutional politics to effect change. Contemporary debates—over issues such as abortion, gun rights, racial justice, voting rights and privacy—show how legal doctrines, electoral politics and public opinion interact. Students should pay particular attention to the mechanisms by which rights are protected, limited or altered: constitutional amendment, congressional statute, executive policy and Supreme Court interpretation, each of which can be contested terrain.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Congress, the presidency and elections, begin by clearly defining key terms and briefly outlining the constitutional basis for the issue. For 9-mark “explain” questions, aim to develop three well-explained points that combine institutional description with an example—this demonstrates AO1 knowledge and some AO2 analysis. For 25-mark extract-based questions, use the extract as a springboard: summarise the argument, assess its validity by applying relevant factual knowledge and argue both for and against the extract’s claims before reaching a balanced conclusion that evaluates the strength of the evidence. For 25-mark essays, construct a clear thesis and organise the answer into analytical paragraphs that explain, illustrate with specific examples (Supreme Court cases, landmark legislation, presidential actions, elections) and evaluate the strengths and limits of the argument. Comparative points can strengthen essays if relevant, but ensure the focus remains on the US where required. Time management is essential: plan briefly, allocate time by marks (for example, for a 25-mark essay allow around 35–40 minutes including planning), and leave a few minutes to review. Always link factual material to the question, use examples to substantiate claims, and end with a reasoned conclusion that reflects the balance of your analysis.
