# Parliamentary and delegated law-making (A-level Law Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: why law is made by Parliament and others
Parliamentary law-making lies at the heart of the constitutional system of the United Kingdom. Parliament is the supreme legislature and is responsible for creating primary legislation — Acts of Parliament — which set out legal rules of general application. However, modern government relies heavily on a wider range of law-making techniques. Primary legislation often establishes broad principles and delegates detailed or technical rule-making to ministers, public bodies and local authorities. This delegated law-making allows the legal system to respond quickly, to draw on specialist expertise and to manage detailed regulation without requiring the full parliamentary process for every adjustment. As an A-level student you should understand both the formal legislative role of Parliament and the practical reasons why much law is made outside the Chamber, together with the constitutional and legal limits that apply to those powers.

## Parliamentary law-making in practice
The process by which a government measure becomes an Act of Parliament is formal and deliberate. Law-making usually begins with proposals formed within government. Policy may be consulted on through a Green Paper, which invites comment and debate, before being refined in a White Paper that sets out firm proposals. A Bill is then introduced to Parliament and proceeds through a sequence of stages designed to test and scrutinise the proposal. These stages include readings in both Houses, detailed examination in committee, opportunities for amendment and further report stages, and finally consideration of any differences between the Commons and the Lords. A Bill that successfully navigates these stages receives Royal Assent and becomes an Act of Parliament. This formal process gives primary legislation democratic legitimacy and a high degree of permanence, but it is also time-consuming and can be influenced by political priorities, manifesto commitments, pressure groups and public opinion. While Parliament is sovereign in theory, in practice its law-making is shaped by political realities and institutional relationships.

## The formal legislative process and parliamentary supremacy
The formal stages of parliamentary law-making create multiple points at which policy is examined and altered. First readings introduce the Bill, second readings allow debate on principle, committee stages scrutinise detail, and report and third readings give further opportunities for amendment. The bicameral structure means that the House of Lords can delay and revise legislation but not finally block government Bills; the House of Commons has the decisive power in a democratic system. The doctrine of parliamentary supremacy underpins this framework: Parliament can make or unmake any law, and no other body can override a valid Act of Parliament. Nonetheless, there are important practical and legal constraints on Parliament’s freedom. Devolution settlements give legislative powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on certain matters, requiring cooperation and sometimes limiting Westminster’s scope. The incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law by the Human Rights Act introduced interpretative duties and a mechanism for declarations of incompatibility, which influence parliamentary law-making. Historically, European Union law also affected domestic legislation through principles of supremacy and direct effect; this historical context is important for understanding how different sources of law interacted in recent decades.

## Delegated legislation: types and reasons for use
Delegated legislation, sometimes called secondary or subordinate legislation, is law made by bodies or persons under powers conferred by an Act of Parliament. The main types are statutory instruments made by ministers to fill in technical detail under enabling provisions in Acts, byelaws created by local authorities and certain public bodies to regulate local matters, and Orders in Council used for a variety of functions including emergency measures or transferring powers. Delegated law is used because modern government needs to regulate complex technical areas — such as traffic regulation, environmental standards or social security administration — that would be impractical to manage through primary legislation alone. It allows swift responses to changing circumstances, the incorporation of expert knowledge into legal rules, and the possibility of localised regulation tailored to particular communities. Enabling Acts set the boundaries of delegated powers; understanding the wording of such Acts is essential when assessing whether a particular exercise of delegated power is lawful.

## Parliamentary and judicial controls on delegated legislation
Although delegated legislation is made outside the full parliamentary process, it is subject to both parliamentary and judicial controls. Parliament exercises oversight through procedures set out in the enabling Act, typically the negative and affirmative resolution procedures. Under the negative procedure a statutory instrument becomes law unless Parliament annuls it within a set period; under the affirmative procedure Parliament must expressly approve the instrument before it takes effect. Select committees, such as those that scrutinise statutory instruments, highlight technical or drafting problems and can draw attention to policy concerns. Publication requirements and debate opportunities create further transparency. Judicial control operates through the courts by way of judicial review. If a delegated instrument goes beyond the powers conferred by the enabling Act it is ultra vires and can be quashed. The courts also supervise procedural compliance, ensuring that required consultations have taken place, and may review the substantive rationality of decisions on public law grounds such as illegality, irrationality (Wednesbury unreasonableness) and procedural impropriety. Where delegated legislation conflicts with primary legislation, the primary Act prevails.

## Advantages and disadvantages of parliamentary and delegated law-making
Parliamentary law-making has the advantage of democratic legitimacy, public scrutiny and durability. Bills are debated on their merits, and Acts of Parliament are readily accessible and authoritative. However, because the parliamentary timetable is crowded and the process is slow, Parliament cannot realistically manage all the detailed regulation needed for a modern state. Delegated legislation supplies that detail quickly and flexibly, often drawing on specialist expertise and allowing for local variation. The downside is the so-called democratic deficit: delegated legislation is typically made by ministers or unelected officials and may receive limited scrutiny in Parliament. There are also practical problems of accessibility and transparency, because a large body of statutory instruments and bylaws can be difficult for the public to navigate. The potential for abuse or error is controlled by judicial review, but remedies are retrospective and often require costly litigation. The balance between efficiency and democratic oversight is therefore the central policy debate surrounding delegated law-making.

## Interaction with other law-making sources and interpretative effects
Parliamentary and delegated law-making do not operate in isolation. Statutory interpretation by the courts shapes how both Acts and delegated instruments operate in practice. Courts apply rules such as the literal, golden and purposive approaches to resolve ambiguities and may use intrinsic and extrinsic aids to reach the legislature’s intended meaning. The Human Rights Act requires courts to read legislation in a way compatible with the Convention rights where possible, and this interpretative obligation influences both primary and secondary legislation. When Parliament has enacted powers, the text of the enabling Act will be scrutinised by judges who may limit the scope of subordinate legislation if it conflicts with fundamental rights or departs from the permitted purpose. The Law Commission and other expert bodies can recommend reform and consolidation to improve clarity and reduce the volume of secondary legislation. Historically, European Union law added another layer, affecting domestic interpretation and sometimes requiring changes to delegated instruments; understanding these historical interactions helps explain many modern developments in statutory interpretation and institutional practice.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on parliamentary and delegated law-making, begin by defining key terms and establishing the legal context. If the question is non-scenario based, set out the legislative process or the nature of delegated powers clearly and accurately, then analyse strengths and weaknesses with reference to examples such as Green and White Papers, the stages of a Bill, statutory instruments, orders in council and bylaws. When a scenario is presented, identify the relevant legal issues raised by the facts, apply the relevant rules on the scope of enabling Acts and grounds for judicial review, and consider parliamentary procedures that might affect the outcome. Use statutory interpretation principles where appropriate and explain how courts might approach the wording of an enabling provision. In evaluation, balance practical advantages such as speed and technical expertise against democratic and accountability concerns, and consider possible reforms such as enhanced parliamentary scrutiny or improved publication and consultation mechanisms. Structure your answer so that each paragraph makes one clear point supported by legal principle, statutory material or a concrete example; signpost your analysis and finish with a concise conclusion that answers the question set. Time management is crucial: allocate time proportional to the mark value, ensure you cover AO1 knowledge and AO2 application before devoting time to AO3 evaluation, and, where possible, use short references to case examples and statutory sections to demonstrate legal authority.
