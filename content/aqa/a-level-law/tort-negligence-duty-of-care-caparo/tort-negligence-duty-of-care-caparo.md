# Tort: negligence, duty of care and the Caparo test (A-level Law Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction
Negligence is the central fault-based tort and a core topic in A-level law. The basic structure of a negligence claim requires the claimant to show that the defendant owed a duty of care, that the defendant breached that duty, and that the breach caused damage which was not too remote. This guide concentrates on the first and often most legally contested stage: the existence and scope of a duty of care. Understanding how the courts decide whether a duty arises is essential because if no duty exists there can be no liability, whatever the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. The law has developed from broad, principle-based statements to a more structured approach. Knowing both the historical principles and the modern tests, and how to apply them to different factual situations, will help you construct clear exam answers and sensible evaluations.

## Historical development and the neighbour principle
The modern law of negligence began with a statement of principle that remains fundamental to legal reasoning. The notion that a person must take reasonable care not to harm those who are so closely and directly affected by their acts that they should be in the defendant’s contemplation as being so affected is encapsulated in the classic formulation known as the “neighbour” principle. This idea directed courts away from purely contractual or criminal concepts towards a broader duty based on relational proximity and foreseeability of harm. Over time judges sought ways to translate that principle into practical rules. At different points the courts experimented with more expansive two-stage tests that asked whether there was sufficient proximity and whether it was fair to impose a duty, but concerns about uncertainty and judicial activism encouraged the development of a more structured three-part inquiry. The modern approach retains the neighbour idea while demanding a clearer justification for imposing liability in novel situations.

## The Caparo three-part test explained
The three-part test commonly associated with Caparo sets out a framework for deciding whether a duty of care should be recognised in a new or unusual situation. The first limb requires that the harm be reasonably foreseeable: could a reasonable person in the defendant’s position have predicted that their conduct might cause the kind of harm the claimant suffered? Foreseeability is the initial filter and is assessed objectively, but it must be applied to the type of harm rather than the precise sequence of events. The second limb asks whether there was a relationship of proximity or neighbourhood between the parties. Proximity is not limited to physical nearness; it covers temporal, causal and relational closeness, such as an established reliance or a specific undertaking by the defendant. The third limb is whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty in all the circumstances. This is where the courts weigh policy considerations: they may refuse to impose a duty to avoid exposing defendants to indeterminate liability, to protect public services from endless litigation, or to respect existing statutory schemes. Together the three limbs provide structure: foreseeability identifies potential victims, proximity links the parties, and the fair/just/reasonable limb checks wider social and policy consequences.

## Applying Caparo: key cases and practical guidance
Applying the Caparo framework requires careful attention to precedent and to the court’s reasoning in prior cases. The original statement of the three-part test came in a case where auditors owed no duty to individual investors in respect of negligent statutory accounts; the decision emphasised the need for proximity and policy limits on liability. Subsequent cases illustrate how each element operates in practice. Where damage is not foreseeable the claimant will fail: for example, the courts have refused to impose duties where a defendant could not reasonably have anticipated the type of harm suffered. Proximity can be shown by a close relationship of reliance or a specific undertaking; negligent misstatements that induced reliance are the classic example where proximity produces a duty. The fair, just and reasonable limb has been used to deny duties in situations where imposing liability would lead to a “floodgates” problem or would conflict with public policy, such as claims against the police for failing to prevent crime in most circumstances. However, recent judicial guidance has emphasised that established categories of duty (for instance, duty owed by manufacturers of defective products to consumers, or by drivers to other road users) remain good law, and that Caparo should be used mainly where the claimant asks the court to recognise a new type of duty. A leading recent decision clarified that if a duty already exists by virtue of earlier authority, courts need not relive the Caparo steps; instead they should apply the existing precedent and treat Caparo as relevant only to novel cases.

## Special categories: psychiatric injury, pure economic loss and omissions
Not all harms are treated equally. The law separates physical injury and damage to property from claims for pure economic loss and psychiatric injury, and it treats liability for omissions differently from liability for positive acts. Pure economic loss—loss of money unaccompanied by physical damage—is treated cautiously because it can lead to large, indeterminate claims. The courts recognise duties for negligent misstatements where a special relationship of reliance exists, but they will not generally extend liability for pure economic loss beyond familiar categories. Psychiatric injury is also subject to additional safeguards. Claimants are divided into primary victims, who are directly involved in an incident and may recover if psychiatric harm was foreseeable, and secondary victims, who witness or learn about an event involving others; secondary victims must satisfy stricter criteria, including close ties of love and affection, proximity to the event, and that the psychiatric harm was caused by a shocking event. Omissions—failures to act—are another area of careful judicial control. There is no general duty to rescue a stranger, but duties may arise when a defendant has created a danger, assumed responsibility, has control over a third party, or where statute imposes an obligation. Occupiers’ liability and certain professional or supervisory roles often produce duties to act, and the courts will consider these special relationships when applying Caparo or existing precedent.

## Policy considerations and critical evaluation
The development of the duty of care in negligence illustrates the judiciary’s attempt to balance compensating those who are harmed against the social and economic costs of imposing liability too broadly. The structured Caparo approach promotes clarity by requiring foreseeability, proximity and a policy check, which helps prevent indeterminate liability and respects legislative or administrative contexts. Its flexibility allows the courts to adapt to new circumstances without unlimited expansion of tort law. On the other hand, that same flexibility can create unpredictability. Critics argue that Caparo gives judges too much discretion, leading to inconsistent results and uncertainty for lawyers and litigants trying to predict outcomes. The inconsistent application of the policy limb in different factual matrices has produced debate about whether the law is genuinely principled or simply pragmatic. Another tension lies between protecting vulnerable victims and avoiding excessive burdens on public bodies; the courts often decline to impose duties on state agencies or emergency services because of broader policy implications, but this can leave obvious victims without remedies. Understanding these competing aims helps when you are asked to evaluate the law in exam questions: show awareness of the need for principled limits on liability while recognising situations where a strong moral case for compensation exists.

## Practical examples and how judges reason
To see the principles at work it helps to consider a few practical scenarios. If a driver negligently causes a collision and injures another road user, foreseeability and proximity are straightforward and a duty of care is established by longstanding precedent; the fair/just/reasonable limb is rarely contentious because imposing liability aligns with ordinary expectations and public policy. In contrast, where a passer-by suffers psychiatric harm after witnessing a distant accident, the courts will scrutinise whether the claimant was a primary or secondary victim, whether proximity and a close relationship exist, and whether the psychiatric harm was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s negligence. Claims against public authorities often invoke the policy limb: a failure by the police to prevent a crime will normally attract a negative policy conclusion, whereas a positive negligent act by a public official that injures a specific person may be actionable. Claims for negligent misstatement, such as where an accountant’s report is relied upon by an identifiable investor, show how proximity through reliance creates a duty even though the loss is purely financial. These examples show judges balancing legal principle, precedent, and public policy to decide whether a duty should be recognised.

## Exam technique
When tackling an exam question on duty of care and Caparo, begin by identifying the parties and the precise nature of the harm alleged. State the elements of negligence and make clear that your focus is on whether a duty of care arises. If the facts fall squarely within an established category of duty—for example, a driver to other road users, a manufacturer to consumers, or an occupier to lawful visitors—start by explaining the relevant precedent and apply it directly to the facts. If the situation is novel, set out the Caparo three-part test and apply each limb in turn: first explain foreseeability and apply it to the facts; then analyse proximity in terms of physical, temporal, causal or relational closeness; finally discuss whether it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty and bring in relevant policy considerations. Always support your analysis with appropriate case examples and explain how they illuminate the present facts. In evaluation, weigh the advantages of imposing a duty—compensation for harm, deterrence and consistency with moral expectations—against the disadvantages—indeterminate liability, interference with public functions, and possible hindrance to socially valuable activities. Conclude with a clear, balanced judgment about whether a duty should be recognised in the particular scenario, showing that you have considered both the legal tests and the policy implications. Manage your time so that you allocate enough words to analysis and evaluation; extended answers should not be descriptive only, but should argue and judge. Using precise legal terminology, structured paragraphs and signposting (for example, “first”, “second”, “finally”, “in conclusion”) will make your reasoning easy to follow and will score well against the assessment objectives.
