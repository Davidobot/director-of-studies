# English legal system, courts and access to justice (A-level Law Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## The nature of law and its role in society
Law is the system of rules that a society recognises as binding and which can be enforced through state institutions. For A‑level study you should be able to distinguish legal rules from other norms of behaviour such as morals, customs and social conventions, and to explain why that distinction matters for individuals and the state. Law shapes rights and duties and is interwoven with broader social aims: it protects people and property, structures relationships, resolves disputes and balances competing interests such as public safety and private liberty. Central to many debates about the law is the idea of fault. Criminal and civil liability are often founded on a requirement that someone has acted wrongly or negligently; appreciating how fault operates helps explain why different outcomes arise in different areas of law. Theories about law and justice, and about the relationship between law and morality, are also important: law can enforce moral values to a degree, but a pluralist society will contain deep moral disagreement and the law must navigate that diversity. Thinking about these conceptual questions—what law is for, how it should operate and how it achieves or fails to achieve justice—gives you a critical framework that you will use across criminal, civil and human rights topics.

## How law is made and interpreted
Understanding law‑making is essential because rules can arise from multiple sources and because the origin of a rule affects how it is applied. Primary legislation made by Parliament remains the most important source: you should be able to describe the formal legislative process and recognise the political and practical influences on Parliament. Delegated legislation, created by ministers, local authorities or public bodies under powers granted by Parliament, is used for technical detail and rapid responses; it brings advantages of flexibility but raises questions about democratic accountability and judicial control. Judges create law through judicial precedent where decisions in higher courts bind lower ones and the reasoning (ratio decidendi) becomes authoritative while obiter dicta are persuasive. The operation of precedent depends on the court hierarchy and doctrines such as stare decisis, overruling and distinguishing; you should be comfortable explaining the advantages of certainty and consistency as well as the disadvantages when precedent becomes inflexible. Statutory interpretation is another core area: the literal rule, the golden rule and the mischief rule are traditional tools for resolving ambiguity, while the purposive approach takes account of broader legislative intent. Internal and external aids are used to interpret text, and the Human Rights Act 1998 and, historically, European Union law have influenced how courts read statutes. Where relevant, note that the UK’s relationship with EU law has evolved since Brexit; many principles of EU law remain important to study as retained law and as part of the historical development of UK law. Finally, law reform bodies such as the Law Commission play a role in proposing consolidation, codification and repeal, and you should be able to discuss their strengths and limitations.

## Courts, tribunals and alternative dispute resolution
The structure of the courts and the wider systems for resolving disputes determine where and how disputes are heard. In the civil system, cases are allocated to tracks in the county courts and the High Court depending on complexity and value, and there is a developed appeal structure leading ultimately to the Supreme Court. The criminal system has magistrates’ courts for summary and preliminary matters and the Crown Court for serious trials; appeals follow a different route. Tribunals provide specialist, quicker forums for areas such as social security or immigration and are increasingly important in the modern justice landscape. Mediation and negotiation are forms of alternative dispute resolution that can settle disputes without full court hearings; they are particularly significant in civil law where cost and time are often decisive. Understand the roles and powers of the different courts and tribunals and be able to explain how procedural choices affect access to justice, the pace of dispute resolution and the enforceability of outcomes.

## Legal personnel, the judiciary and judicial independence
To understand how the system functions you need to know the roles of the people who work within it. Barristers, solicitors and legal executives each perform distinct functions: solicitors often prepare cases and advise clients, barristers traditionally specialise in advocacy and courtroom advocacy, and legal executives occupy specialist advisory and practice roles; in practice the boundaries have blurred and modern regulation recognises a range of authorised legal professionals. Judges at different levels have distinct responsibilities, and the independence of the judiciary is a constitutional principle safeguarded by security of tenure, immunity from suit and institutional separation from the executive. Judicial independence allows judges to make decisions according to law and conscience without improper pressure, and it is a key part of the rule of law which requires that no person be punished except according to established law, that laws be clear and applied equally, and that legal processes be fair. In addition to explaining these protections, be ready to evaluate tensions that arise when judges interpret socially sensitive statutes or review executive action: the balance between democratic legitimacy and rights protection is a recurring exam theme.

## Access to justice and funding
Access to justice considers not just the existence of laws but whether people can effectively use them. Practical sources of legal help include helplines, Citizens Advice, law centres and trade unions; these provide initial advice and signposting. Funding mechanisms are crucial: private funding, legal expenses insurance and conditional fee agreements (so called “no win, no fee”) all play roles in civil justice. Public funding is available in certain criminal and civil cases, but the scope of legal aid is limited and subject to means and merits tests. The costs of litigation, the complexity of procedure and geographical and informational barriers all affect who can access the system. In criminal trials, defendants have rights to representation in serious cases and to a fair trial; in civil matters, the prevalence of fixed costs and the availability of alternative dispute resolution influence whether people pursue claims. When discussing access to justice, always link practical realities to legal principle: a theoretically available remedy is of limited force if costs, delays or procedural hurdles make it inaccessible in practice.

## Overview of substantive areas: criminal law, tort, contract and human rights
A‑level Law requires detailed knowledge of representative areas of substantive law and the ability to apply and evaluate legal rules. In criminal law you must understand general elements of liability such as actus reus and mens rea, causation and the coincidence of elements, together with specific offences including homicide (murder and manslaughter and their partial defences), non‑fatal offences against the person from common law assault and battery to statutory offences under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, property crimes like theft and robbery, and inchoate offences such as attempt. Defences—insanity, automatism, intoxication, self‑defence and duress—require both doctrinal knowledge and sensitivity to policy questions about blame and responsibility.

In tort, negligence is central: you should be able to explain duty of care, using the neighbour principle and the Caparo test, breach judged against an objective standard, factual and legal causation and remoteness, and remedies, particularly compensatory damages and injunctions. Occupiers’ liability, nuisance and the rule in Rylands v Fletcher broaden your understanding of liability for land and the escape of dangerous things, while vicarious liability explores when employers are held responsible for employees’ wrongs. Defences such as contributory negligence and consent qualify liability and are important for problem solving.

Contract law concentrates on formation—offer, acceptance, consideration and intention to create legal relations—along with terms (express and implied), statutory protections for consumers under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 including implied standards in goods and services, exclusion clauses and their control under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Consumer Rights Act, and vitiating factors such as misrepresentation and economic duress. You should understand discharge of contract by performance, breach and frustration, and remedies ranging from damages to equitable specific performance. Human Rights law explores the development of rights instruments after the Second World War, the European Convention on Human Rights and its incorporation into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998, and key Convention guarantees such as the right to life, liberty, privacy, freedom of expression and assembly. Be prepared to explain how domestic courts apply and the extent to which they are influenced by the European Court of Human Rights, to analyse limitations and justifications for restrictions on rights, and to evaluate debates about the protection of rights in the UK.

## Exam technique
Answering A‑level Law questions well depends as much on method as on knowledge. Papers assess three skills: knowledge and understanding (AO1), application (AO2) and analysis and evaluation (AO3). For problem questions follow a clear legal structure: identify the legal issues, state the relevant rules and authorities, apply the law to the facts carefully and reach a concise conclusion. This IRAC approach—Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion—helps you show AO2 skills. For non‑scenario or essay questions focus on AO3: set out the key authorities and principles, explain competing arguments and policy considerations, evaluate strengths and weaknesses and arrive at a reasoned judgement. Always support points with legal authority where appropriate: a named statute or leading case strengthens answers and demonstrates AO1, but avoid listing cases without explanation; explain why the authority matters and how it affects the facts or policy you are discussing.

Manage time by allocating marks to minutes and by planning longer answers briefly before you write. Read command words carefully: “explain” asks for knowledge and clarity, “advise” requires application to facts and practical conclusions, “consider” and “assess” demand sustained analysis and balanced evaluation. For evaluation avoid unsupported opinion; instead use legal principles, comparative examples, the likely practical consequences of a rule and, where possible, reform proposals to show depth. Where the question invites recommendations, be precise about the change and its legal effects. Finally, write clearly, use appropriate legal terminology and signpost your reasoning so examiners can follow your argument; a well‑structured answer that reaches a clear, justified conclusion will score strongly across the assessment objectives.
