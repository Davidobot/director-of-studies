# Offences against the person and property (A-level Law Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: why these offences matter
Offences against the person and offences against property sit at the heart of criminal law because they protect the most basic legal interests: life, bodily integrity, personal autonomy and the possessions on which people rely. The law balances individual liberty with public safety by setting out which acts are criminal, the mental states required for liability, and the defences that excuse or justify conduct. Studying these offences develops an understanding of concepts such as harm, fault and legal responsibility, and reveals the policy choices behind criminalisation — for example the importance of fair labelling, the need for certainty in the law, and the role of fault in deciding culpability. Knowing the structure of offences, and how actus reus and mens rea combine, is essential both for exam problem questions and for appreciating how courts decide difficult factual disputes.

## Actus reus and mens rea: the building blocks of liability
Every offence requires an actus reus (the physical element) and, unless it is a strict liability offence, a mens rea (the mental element). The actus reus may be an active deed, an omission where the defendant had a legal duty to act, or a state of affairs. The requirement that conduct be voluntary is crucial: involuntary acts — for example movements caused by a medical episode — can negate the actus reus. Causation links conduct to result in offences of consequence. Factual causation is assessed by the "but for" test, and legal causation considers whether a chain of events has been broken by a novus actus interveniens; foreseeability and directness are relevant here. Mens rea takes several forms: intention (direct or oblique), subjective recklessness (knowing there is a risk and taking it), and negligence in some offences. Transferred malice allows a defendant’s intention aimed at one person to be transferred if another person is harmed. These general rules are applied across both offences against the person and property offences, and exam answers must precisely identify and apply these elements to the facts given.

## Homicide: murder and manslaughter
Homicide law is structured around the worst result — the unlawful killing of another human being. Murder requires an unlawful killing combined with malice aforethought, meaning an intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. Courts distinguish direct and oblique intention; oblique intention arises where the consequence was virtually certain and the defendant appreciated that. The leading examples of partial defences reduce murder to manslaughter. Loss of control replaces the old provocation rule and requires a qualifying trigger and that a person of the defendant’s sex and age and with a normal degree of tolerance would have reacted similarly; the statutory framework excludes sexual infidelity as a qualifying trigger. Diminished responsibility requires an abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition that substantially impaired the defendant’s ability to understand, form a rational judgment, or exercise self-control. Involuntary manslaughter covers killings that lack the mens rea for murder. There are two main types: unlawful act manslaughter, where a defendant commits an unlawful and dangerous act that causes death, and gross negligence manslaughter, where a duty of care is breached in such a negligent way that it merits criminal punishment. The gross negligence route focuses on the defendant’s breach, the risk of death and the seriousness of the breach. Famous authorities illustrate how fact-sensitive these doctrines are; answers should explain the legal tests and then apply them carefully to the scenario.

## Non-fatal offences against the person
Non-fatal offences form a layered structure from the simplest assaults to the most serious grievous bodily harm. Assault occurs where a defendant causes another to apprehend immediate unlawful force; words, gestures or even silent phone calls can suffice if they create that apprehension. Battery is the application of unlawful force, even if very slight, and everyday touching can amount to battery if it is without lawful justification. The Offences Against the Person Act creates statutory gradations: section 47 criminalises assault or battery occasioning actual bodily harm, which can include psychiatric injury if the harm is a recognised psychiatric condition. Section 20 covers unlawful and malicious wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm with a lower mental element — recklessness as to some harm — whereas section 18 targets wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent, requiring a higher fault element. The difference in mens rea between s20 and s18 makes the mens rea analysis central to advising on likely charges and defences. The courts have developed doctrines about what counts as bodily harm, when consent removes liability, and how to treat injuries caused in a fight or in medical contexts; exam answers should define each offence, identify the relevant mens rea, then apply those elements to the facts with clear reasoning.

## Property offences: theft, robbery and related crimes
Property offences protect the ownership and enjoyment of property. Theft, under the statute, requires an appropriation of property belonging to another, carried out dishonestly with the intention of permanently depriving the owner. The concept of appropriation is broad and includes assuming any rights of the owner; whether property “belongs to another” can be tricky where possession or control is disputed. Dishonesty used to be judged under a two-stage test in case law that combined an objective and a subjective limb, but more recent authority altered the test and emphasises the defendant’s actual state of belief about honesty. Intention to permanently deprive can be shown by borrowing beyond a time when return is realistically expected. Robbery elevates theft by adding force, or the threat of force, immediately before or at the time of the taking, used to steal. Because property offences often arise from mixed motives and complex factual patterns, exam answers should carefully match each factual strand to the statutory elements: show appropriation, explain why the property belongs to someone else, address dishonesty by reference to the defendant’s belief, and analyse whether the intent to permanently deprive is present. Where force is alleged, explain whether it was applied to secure the theft and whether it was sufficient to amount to robbery.

## Inchoate offences: attempts and preparatory acts
Inchoate, or preliminary, offences allow the law to intervene before the full harm occurs. Attempt is the principal inchoate crime and requires an act which is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the intended offence, together with the necessary mens rea for that offence. The boundary between mere preparation and attempt is fact-sensitive and jurisprudence provides examples of conduct held to fall short of an attempt and conduct held to cross the line. The prosecution must prove an intention to commit the substantive offence and that the defendant’s actions moved beyond planning into execution. These rules prevent criminal liability based on mere thoughts or idle plans, while enabling intervention once a defendant takes concrete steps to carry out a criminal scheme. When answering exam scenarios, set out the statutory test, apply the “more than merely preparatory” principle to each factual act, and explain whether the necessary intent can be inferred from the defendant’s conduct.

## Defences: capacity, justification and excuse
A wide range of defences can discharge or reduce criminal liability, and each has precise legal requirements. Capacity defences include insanity, governed by the classic rules which require a defect of reason from a disease of the mind that prevents the defendant from knowing the nature and quality of the act or that it was wrong. Automatism operates where involuntary conduct has an external cause, producing actions for which the defendant lacks voluntary control; the distinction between insane and non-insane automatism is legally significant because it affects the result and possible consequences. Intoxication is treated differently depending on whether it was voluntary or involuntary and whether the offence requires specific intent; voluntary intoxication may negate specific intent crimes but generally does not excuse basic intent offences. Self-defence and prevention of crime permit the use of reasonable force to protect oneself or others; the reasonableness of force is judged objectively, though the defendant’s genuine belief about the need to use force can be relevant. Duress and duress of circumstances excuse conduct undertaken in response to threats of death or serious injury, but the availability of the defence is restricted — it is not a defence to murder, and the claimant’s culpability and voluntary exposure to risk are assessed. When advising or answering problems, set out each defence’s statutory or common law test, examine how the defendant’s state of mind and circumstances fit those tests, and consider whether public policy limits apply.

## Exam technique
Answering problem questions on offences against the person and property requires precision, structure and selective use of authority. Start by identifying the legal issues raised by the facts: name the possible offences and any likely defences. Use a clear structure such as IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) for each issue so the examiner can follow your reasoning. Define the offence by stating the relevant statutory provision or legal elements, then identify the actus reus and mens rea, and any special rules (for example, causation principles in homicide, or the difference between s20 and s18). Apply the law to the facts step by step: show how each fact satisfies or undermines an element, and consider alternative interpretations where the facts are ambiguous. Where case law establishes nuanced tests (oblique intention, diminished responsibility, gross negligence), summarise the test succinctly and explain its application to the scenario. Don’t neglect defences: for each potential defence set out its requirements and assess whether the defendant’s circumstances meet them, remembering public policy limits (for example duress is not available for murder). Balance descriptive knowledge (AO1) with clear application (AO2) and evaluation (AO3): where appropriate, comment briefly on policy or difficulties the law creates, or on how a court might exercise discretion in sentencing. Manage time by planning answers, using authorities to support key points rather than attempting to exhaustively list cases, and conclude with a focused, reasoned judgment on likely liability and outcomes. In practice questions, precision about mens rea and causation, and a disciplined application of legal tests to facts, are the most reliable ways to gain marks.
