# Defences in criminal law (insanity, automatism, duress, self-defence) (A-level Law Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: types of defences and how they operate
In criminal law a defence either denies liability by showing the defendant lacked a required element of the offence (for example the necessary mens rea or a voluntary act) or justifies the conduct as lawful in the circumstances. Insanity and automatism are capacity defences: they relate to the defendant’s mental state or control at the time of the act and, if successful, can negate the required criminal responsibility. Duress and self‑defence are necessity or justification defences: they accept that the defendant committed the act but argue that it was excusable because of threats, pressure or the need to protect oneself or others. For A-level study it is important to distinguish between defences that negate fault (insanity/automatism) and those that justify conduct (duress/self‑defence), to understand the legal tests that apply to each, and to appreciate the practical consequences of a successful plea: automatism normally leads to an acquittal; insanity yields a special verdict and possible hospital or supervisory orders; duress and self‑defence, if made out, result in acquittal because the law recognises the circumstances as excusing the conduct.

## Insanity: the legal test and practical consequences
The law on insanity stems from the M’Naghten rules and subsequent judicial development. The classic test requires that, at the time of the act, the defendant suffered from a “defect of reason” arising from a “disease of the mind” such that they did not know the nature and quality of the act, or, if they did know it, did not know that what they were doing was wrong. There are three core elements to cover in an answer: first, whether there was an internal condition amounting to a disease of the mind; second, whether that condition caused a defect of reason; and third, whether that defect meant the defendant did not appreciate the nature or wrongness of the act.

The distinction between internal and external causes is crucial. Conditions internal in origin (for example, a psychotic illness, certain epileptic episodes or some forms of sleep disorder) are more likely to attract the insanity label; by contrast, a temporary loss of self-control caused by an external factor (for example a blow to the head or involuntary reaction to medication) may point away from insanity and towards automatism. The practical effect of a successful insanity defence is not a normal acquittal but a “special verdict” (historically “not guilty by reason of insanity”), which typically allows the courts to make hospital orders, guardianship orders, restrictions, or a discharge, reflecting a focus on protection and treatment rather than punishment. For exam answers note also the unusual burden of proof: a defendant who raises insanity usually bears the evidential or legal burden of proving it on the balance of probabilities, unlike most other elements of a crime where the prosecution must prove matters beyond reasonable doubt.

## Automatism: involuntary actions and external causes
Automatism describes acts done without voluntary control: the body moves but the conscious mind does not direct the movement. Legally this defence requires that the involuntary act was caused by an external factor and that the defendant’s actions were truly involuntary. The law draws a contrast between “insane automatism” (linked to internal disease and governed by the insanity rules) and “non‑insane automatism” (caused by an external event such as a blow to the head, a spasm, or an adverse reaction to medication).

To use automatism in practice a defendant must show that at the relevant moment they had no voluntary control of their bodily movements and that the state was not self-induced in a way that precludes the defence. If successful, automatism leads to a full acquittal because the actus reus element of a voluntary act is absent. In teaching, emphasise careful factual analysis: identify the cause (internal or external), decide whether the defendant’s own conduct contributed to that state (for example, self‑induced intoxication generally bars the defence), and demonstrate how the absence of voluntariness defeats the actus reus. Case examples that illustrate the dividing line are useful: where hypoglycaemia caused by insulin (an external medical trigger) led to involuntary conduct, the court treated this differently from hyperglycaemia caused by failure to take insulin (an internal disease), showing the practical difference between automatism and insanity.

## Duress and duress of circumstances: coercion, limits and the two-element test
Duress excuses crimes committed because the defendant was compelled to act by threats of death or serious bodily harm. The law approaches duress in two related ways: duress by threats (where a person threatens the defendant or a close family member) and duress of circumstances (where surrounding events, not a human threat, place the defendant under pressure to act to avoid death or serious injury). In both forms the core idea is that the defendant acted under a reasonably held belief that death or serious harm would occur if they did not comply and that a reasonable person in the defendant’s position might have acted similarly.

Two central limits should be highlighted. First, duress is not a defence to murder or attempted murder in English law: threats cannot justify taking an innocent life. Second, the defendant’s own mistaken choices may bar the defence: if the defendant voluntarily associated with criminal companions or knew of their propensity for violence, they may be precluded from relying on duress. The legal test commonly taught has a subjective element (did the defendant genuinely fear death or serious injury?) and an objective element (would a person of reasonable firmness, sharing some of the defendant’s characteristics, have acted the same?). For duress of circumstances the factual scenario must show imminent danger and a reasonable perception of no safe alternative. In practice exam answers need to consider the seriousness and immediacy of the threat, the relationship between the threat and the criminal act, and any features of the defendant (age, pregnancy, serious mental disability) that may affect the objective assessment.

## Self-defence and prevention of crime: necessity, honest belief and proportionality
Self-defence is a general justification allowing a person to use reasonable force to protect themselves, others, or property, or to prevent crime. The law focuses on necessity and proportionality. Necessity asks whether the defendant honestly believed it was necessary to use force; that honest belief can sometimes be mistaken, and an honestly held mistake will often permit the defence even if the mistake was unreasonable, although the reasonableness of the mistake will affect whether the defendant can claim the defence under some formulations. Proportionality requires that the force used was reasonable in response to the perceived threat; excessive or grossly disproportionate force will defeat the defence.

Recent statutory developments have clarified aspects of self-defence, particularly in the context of householders and the allowance for defensive reactions in the home. Nonetheless the core approach remains judicial: establish the defendant’s belief in the need to act, show that the force used was not beyond what was reasonably necessary, and consider whether there was a duty to retreat in circumstances where escape was possible. Self-defence differs from duress in that it is a justification — the defendant admits the act but says it was the right thing to do under the circumstances — and it is available for very serious offences including murder, so long as the required criteria are satisfied.

## Burden and standard of proof, evidential obligations and outcomes
Understanding who bears the evidential and legal burdens is central to answering exam questions on defences. For most defences, the defendant must raise some evidence to put the defence in issue; once properly raised, the prosecution must disprove the defence beyond reasonable doubt. An important exception is the insanity defence: here the law places a legal burden on the defendant to prove insanity on the balance of probabilities. With automatism, because it denies voluntariness, once evidence is introduced the prosecution must negate this defence beyond reasonable doubt. Duress and self‑defence require evidence that a reasonable person would consider; once the defence is in play the jury assesses whether the facts meet the legal tests. Always make clear in answers what the practical result of success will be: full acquittal (automatism, duress, self-defence), special verdict with possible hospital orders (insanity), or no defence and therefore conviction.

## Teaching points, examples and common problem-areas
When teaching these defences the best approach is to work from structured hypotheticals that force students to identify and apply legal tests. Simple but realistic scenarios are effective: a diabetic who strikes someone while deeply hypoglycaemic (raise automatism vs insanity questions), a driver who speeds to escape attackers after receiving threats (raise duress/duress of circumstances and consider immediacy and proportionality), or a homeowner who uses force against an intruder (explore self‑defence and the householder discretion). Common pitfalls for students include failing to distinguish internal from external causes, conflating justification with excuse, and not addressing statutory limits (for example duress is not available for murder). Encourage students to state the legal test at the start of each paragraph, apply facts directly to each element, and consider possible counter‑arguments such as voluntary intoxication, voluntary association with criminals, or availability of safe alternatives. Use case examples to illustrate lines (for example the M’Naghten test for insanity, Bratty on automatism and the internal/external distinction, and the line of authority excluding duress for murder), but always tie cases to the facts of the problem you are analysing.

## Exam technique
Begin answers by identifying the crime and then the precise defence(s) in issue. Set out the legal test(s) clearly and concisely before applying them to the facts; this shows examiners you understand the law and gives a roadmap for your analysis. For capacity defences follow a stepwise approach: identify the cause of the defendant’s state (internal or external), explain which legal doctrine applies (insanity or automatism), and apply each element of the relevant test to the facts. For justification defences (duress, duress of circumstances, self‑defence) separate the subjective element (the defendant’s genuine belief or fear) from the objective element (how a reasonable person would act) and address statutory limits such as the unavailability of duress for murder. Always discuss the burden and standard of proof and state the practical outcome if the defence succeeds. Where relevant, evaluate strengths and weaknesses and consider policy or fairness points briefly if the question invites AO3 evaluation. Use precise legal terminology, integrate statutory and case authority where it assists clarity, and conclude with a focused judgment on whether the defence is likely to succeed based on the presented facts.
