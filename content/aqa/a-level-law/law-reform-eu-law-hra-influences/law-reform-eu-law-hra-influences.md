# Law reform, EU law and Human Rights Act influences (A-level Law Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Why these topics matter for A-level law
Understanding law reform, the influence of European Union law and the effects of the Human Rights Act 1998 is central to appreciating how the law in England and Wales develops, is interpreted and is applied. These three forces operate at different levels. Law reform bodies and Parliament make and reshape domestic law; EU law (historically and in its continuing residual form) introduced supranational doctrines and interpretative pressures that altered how courts read domestic statutes; and the Human Rights Act changed the relationship between domestic courts, public bodies and rights protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. For students this means being able to explain processes (how a law is made or changed), apply legal rules to scenarios, and evaluate the balance between democratic law-making and judicial law‑development — all skills assessed by AQA’s A-level law papers.

## The Law Commission and law reform: purpose, methods and limits
The Law Commission exists to keep the law under review and to propose reforms to make it fairer, clearer and more accessible. Its work falls into reform, consolidation, codification and repeal. Reform projects identify defects in the law and publish consultation papers and final reports with draft bills. Consolidation gathers related statutes into a single Act to improve clarity; codification seeks to pull together rules on a single subject into a coherent code; repeal removes obsolete provisions.

The advantages of reform through the Law Commission include careful research, consultation with practitioners and stakeholders, and the production of drafts that Parliament can use. However, political priorities, parliamentary time and competing interests can delay or prevent implementation. Students should be able to explain why Law Commission proposals are persuasive yet not determinative: Parliament remains sovereign and decides whether to accept recommendations. In exam answers, illustrate the point by describing how a Law Commission report might reform an area of tort or criminal law, then evaluate the political, economic and practical barriers to those reforms becoming statute.

## EU institutions, sources of EU law and their impact on UK law
Before Brexit, European Union law had a profound effect on domestic law through two principal doctrines: direct effect and supremacy. Direct effect, established in the Court of Justice of the European Union, allows certain EU provisions to create rights which individuals can rely on in domestic courts. Supremacy means EU law takes precedence over domestic law where there is conflict, and domestic courts must give effect to EU obligations even if a national statute appears inconsistent. The domestic implication was dramatic: UK legislation could, in practice, be disapplied to the extent it conflicted with EU law, as demonstrated in the case where domestic merchant shipping rules were set aside to protect rights created by EU rules.

The key EU institutions that produced law and guidance were the European Council, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Court of Justice of the European Union. EU law sources include treaties, regulations (directly applicable), directives (binding as to result but leaving national implementation to states) and decisions. Directives required national courts to adopt an interpretative approach that, as far as possible, gave effect to the directive’s purpose. The CJEU required national courts to interpret domestic law purposively to achieve EU aims.

Since the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, the legal landscape has changed but the historical influence persists. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act converted much pre‑exit EU law into "retained EU law" so that courts continue to apply many of the rules that applied before exit. The CJEU’s jurisprudence developed over decades and remains part of the conceptual background of many areas of law; moreover, the courts may still consider pre-exit CJEU decisions when interpreting retained EU law. Students should be prepared to explain both the historic doctrines of direct effect and supremacy and the post‑withdrawal framework under which retained EU law operates, showing how the legacy of EU law still affects statutory interpretation, contractual rights and regulatory regimes.

## The Human Rights Act 1998: incorporation, duties and practical effects
The Human Rights Act 1998 domesticated the European Convention on Human Rights by requiring UK public authorities to act compatibly with Convention rights and by requiring UK courts to take account of Strasbourg jurisprudence. Its central features relevant to A-level study are the duty on public authorities under section 6, the interpretative obligation in section 3, the power to issue a declaration of incompatibility in section 4, and the requirement in section 2 that domestic courts "take into account" decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.

Section 3 obliges courts, so far as it is possible, to read and give effect to primary and subordinate legislation in a way that is compatible with Convention rights. This does not allow judges to rewrite statutes so as to impose meanings that are impossible, but it does allow creative interpretation where ordinary language admits a Convention‑compatible meaning. A prominent example illustrated how the courts used section 3 to interpret domestic social security or tenancy provisions so that they avoided incompatibility with Convention rights. Section 4 allows higher courts to declare that a statute is incompatible with Convention rights; such a declaration does not strike down the statute but signals to Parliament that remedial action is required. The practical effect is a dialogue between courts and Parliament: the courts identify rights breaches and Parliament decides how to respond.

Section 6 makes it unlawful for public authorities to act in a way incompatible with Convention rights, creating a powerful tool in judicial review and public law litigation. The Act’s effect on criminal and civil law is wide: it influences investigatory powers, detention and prison rules, privacy and free speech controversies, and more. For example, the law on searches and prisoner correspondence has been shaped by the need to satisfy proportionality and fairness under Convention rights. Students should be able to explain how the HRA alters the balance of powers, why courts are cautious not to overstep Parliament, and how courts apply proportionality as the central test when rights conflict.

## Statutory interpretation and precedent: how EU law and the HRA shaped judicial approaches
Traditional rules of statutory interpretation — the literal, golden and mischief rules — remain important introductory concepts. In practice, however, the purposive approach has become prominent because EU law and the Human Rights Act press courts to interpret domestic statutes in ways that achieve wider aims. The CJEU’s Marleasing principle required national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, to give effect to directives. In the UK, this meant judges often favoured a purposive reading to ensure compliance with EU obligations. The Human Rights Act similarly encourages a purposive, rights‑conscious approach: under section 3 domestic provisions must, where possible, be read compatibly with Convention rights.

Judicial precedent remains a key constraint on lower courts. The hierarchy of courts governs which decisions are binding and which can be distinguished or overruled. Higher courts’ acceptance of purposive interpretation shaped subsequent authority. Students should practise identifying how a court’s approach to interpretation would affect the outcome of a scenario: would a literal meaning resolve the case, or would a purposive/HRA‑informed reading lead to a different conclusion? That analytical skill is central to AO2 and AO3 in the exams.

## Delegated legislation, judicial control and human rights/EU constraints
Delegated legislation (statutory instruments, orders in council and bylaws) is a pragmatic tool for detailed and technical rule‑making. Parliament controls delegated legislation through procedures such as negative and affirmative resolution and through judicial review. Courts can strike down delegated legislation that exceeds the powers granted by the parent Act (ultra vires) or that conflicts with higher‑ranking law. Both EU law and the Human Rights Act add safeguards: before Brexit, delegated instruments had to comply with EU obligations; after incorporation of Convention rights, subordinate legislation must be compatible with Convention rights and can be challenged accordingly. This creates an important classroom link between administrative law, human rights and constitutional principles. For example, students should be able to explain how a public body’s regulation might be quashed if it violates Convention rights or exceeds the scope of authority granted by an Act of Parliament.

## Constitutional and devolutionary impacts
The introduction of EU law and the Human Rights Act produced constitutional consequences that go beyond technical legal interpretation. EU supremacy challenged parliamentary supremacy in practice, while the Human Rights Act required courts and public bodies across the UK, including devolved institutions, to observe Convention rights. The HRA is especially significant in the devolution context because it gave the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly a protected sphere: where devolved legislation is incompatible with Convention rights, courts in those jurisdictions have specific remedial tools. The interplay between parliamentary sovereignty and rights protection is a recurring evaluative theme in A-level law: students should be able to weigh arguments about democratic accountability, judicial protection of minorities, and practical consequences of entrenched rights.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on law reform, EU law and the Human Rights Act, begin by precisely identifying the legal issues and the relevant sources of law. For application questions, set out the rule clearly and then apply it to the facts: if statutory interpretation is at issue, explain which interpretative approach applies and why; if a Convention right is engaged, identify the specific article and consider proportionality and possible derogations. For evaluation, balance advantages and disadvantages and link them to practical outcomes; for example, weigh the democratic legitimacy of Parliament against the protective function of courts under the HRA, or discuss how EU doctrines promoted uniformity but limited domestic legislative freedom. Use key cases and statutes to support points — naming a representative case or statute (for example, the case establishing EU supremacy, a leading HRA interpretative case, or a Law Commission report that was implemented) strengthens answers — and always conclude: an effective conclusion summarises the argument and, where appropriate, gives a justified view on the preferable legal approach. Practise timing so you can fully develop analysis and evaluation within the exam’s mark scheme, and remember that clear structure and precise legal terminology boost AO1, while careful application and sustained evaluation meet AO2 and AO3.
