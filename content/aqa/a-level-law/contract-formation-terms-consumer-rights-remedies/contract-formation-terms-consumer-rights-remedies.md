# Contract law: formation, terms, Consumer Rights Act and remedies (A-level Law Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview of contract formation
Contract law governs the voluntary exchanges that private parties make binding; to form an enforceable contract there must be agreement, consideration and an intention to create legal relations. Agreement itself requires a valid offer and an unequivocal acceptance of that offer. The law distinguishes mere invitations to treat from offers: an invitation to treat invites offers from others and therefore does not bind the inviter. Common classroom examples are shop displays and advertisements, which are normally treated as invitations to treat so that the seller retains control over whether to accept a buyer’s offer. In contrast, a clear promise addressed to the world at large that proposes a set of terms in return for specified acts can be a unilateral offer, accepted by performance — the classic example being the carbolic smoke ball advert case which illustrates that performance can constitute acceptance where the offeror has promised a reward for compliance.

## Offer, acceptance and communication
An offer is an expression of willingness to be bound on specified terms and can be revoked before acceptance unless it is a unilateral offer accepted by performance. Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror and must correspond to the terms of the offer; a purported acceptance that changes the terms is a counter-offer, which kills the original offer. The postal rule operates as an exception for acceptance by post: where it is reasonable to use the post, acceptance is effective when the letter is posted, not when it arrives. That rule does not apply to instantaneous communications such as telephone or telex, where acceptance is effective only when received. Modern problems often involve electronic communications and online contracting: the rule is that the general principles apply, but courts consider the parties’ intentions and the nature of the communication. Determining when and how acceptance is communicated is therefore crucial for answering problem questions.

## Consideration and intention to create legal relations
Consideration is the price paid for a promise: something of value must move from the promisee, but it need not be adequate — the law will not judge whether the price is a good deal. Past consideration is no consideration, and performing an existing contractual duty owed to the same promisor will not amount to fresh consideration, although there are important exceptions where practical benefit creates enforceable modification of a contract. The doctrine of promissory estoppel can prevent a promisor from going back on a promise where the promisee has relied on it to their detriment, but that doctrine typically suspends rather than creates causes of action. Intention to create legal relations distinguishes domestic and commercial contexts: agreements between family or friends are presumed not to be legally binding unless the circumstances show otherwise, whereas commercial agreements carry a presumption of legal intention.

## Classification and implication of contractual terms
The content of a contract is made up of express terms agreed by the parties and implied terms inserted by the courts, by statute or by custom. Whether a statement is a term of the contract or a mere representation depends on factors such as the timing of the statement, the relative expertise of the parties, whether the statement was reduced to writing and whether the representor emphasised its importance. Courts use objective tests to decide this point because consequences differ: a breach of a contractual term gives rise to remedies, whereas a false representation may give rise to misrepresentation remedies only. Express terms can be classified as conditions, warranties or innominate terms. A condition is a major term going to the root of the contract and breach may allow termination and damages, whereas a warranty is a lesser term giving rise only to damages. Innominate terms require examination of the consequences of the breach: if the breach deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit, termination may be justified; otherwise the remedy is damages.

Terms may also be implied by fact where necessary to give business efficacy to the transaction or where a reasonable bystander would have assumed the term, a mechanism often expressed through the “officious bystander” test. Statutory implication is especially important for consumer contracts, where Parliament has prescribed minimum standards for goods and services that cannot be easily contracted away.

## Consumer Rights Act 2015 — goods and services
The Consumer Rights Act 2015 modernised and codified much of the law protecting consumers in contracts for goods and services. For goods sold to consumers, the Act implies terms that goods must be of satisfactory quality, fit for any particular purpose made known to the seller, and must match any description. “Satisfactory quality” is measured objectively but takes into account price, description and any pre-existing knowledge the consumer had about the goods. Importantly, the Act introduced a short-term right to reject faulty goods: consumers have 30 days in which to reject goods that do not conform to the contract and obtain a full refund, unless the trader can show another reasonable period applies or the goods are excluded by statute. If the short-term right has expired, the consumer can require repair or replacement; if repair or replacement is not possible or is unsuccessful, the consumer may be entitled to a price reduction or to reject the goods finally and obtain a refund. For services, the Act implies terms that the trader must perform with reasonable care and skill and within a reasonable time where no time is agreed. Remedies for breach of services include the right to repeat performance — the trader must perform again to make the contract conform — and the right to a price reduction when repeat performance is impossible or not completed within a reasonable time or without significant inconvenience.

A practical point for answers is the burden of proof rule: for short periods (commonly the first six months after delivery), a lack of conformity is presumed to have existed at the time of delivery unless the trader can prove otherwise; after that period the consumer bears the burden. When applying the Consumer Rights Act to problems, identify the statutory implied term breached, explain the remedial route the consumer can take depending on timing and the ability of the trader to repair or replace, and remember the measure of any price reduction or refund will usually aim to put the consumer in the position they would have been in had the contract been properly performed.

## Exclusion clauses and statutory control
Parties often try to limit liability by using exclusion or limitation clauses. The courts control such clauses by asking first whether the clause was incorporated into the contract (by signature, reasonable notice or consistent course of dealing), and, if incorporated, construing the clause strictly against the party seeking to rely on it. Signature will usually bind even if the signer did not read the document, but where reliance is placed on notice it must be given in a timely and reasonable way. Even if an exclusion clause is validly incorporated and properly construed to cover the breach, statutory controls can render it ineffective where it is unfair. The Unfair Contract Terms Act historically limited how far a business can exclude liability for negligence or for breach of fundamental obligations; the Consumer Rights Act now provides strong consumer protection by declaring certain terms unfair and rewriting unfair consumer contract terms. Under consumer protection law, clauses that attempt to exclude or restrict implied statutory remedies for consumers will often be invalid or subject to a reasonableness test, and clear, transparent drafting is required for any limitation to have a chance of surviving judicial scrutiny.

## Remedies for breach — common law and consumer-specific
Where a contract is broken, the primary common law remedy is damages designed to compensate the innocent party by placing them in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed. The measure and recoverability of loss require analysis of causation, remoteness and mitigation: losses must be caused by the breach, must not be too remote, and the claimant must take reasonable steps to mitigate loss. Equitable remedies such as specific performance and injunctions are discretionary and typically reserved for situations where damages are inadequate, for example where the subject matter is unique. Rescission can restore parties to their pre-contractual position in some cases, such as misrepresentation, but is subject to bars like affirmation and lapse of time.

Consumer-specific remedies under the Consumer Rights Act sit alongside these common law remedies and often provide quicker, more accessible solutions. For example, a consumer with faulty goods can short-reject within the statutory short-term period and obtain a full refund without proving loss in the way courts require for common law damages. Where a repair or replacement is offered, the consumer is entitled to have the work done within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience; if that fails, they can pursue a price reduction or final rejection. For services, repeat performance must be offered when the service lacked reasonable care and skill, and if that is impossible or unsuccessful the consumer may be entitled to a price reduction reflecting the loss of benefit.

When advising parties, always distinguish whether remedies arise from statutory consumer protections or from general contract law, and consider whether an exclusion clause affects the remedy and whether it is permitted under the Consumer Rights Act.

## Practical examples and common problem areas
Students frequently face problem questions about online sales, pre-contractual statements, and the effects of time on consumer remedies. A customer buying a second-hand car from a private seller will have more limited protection than a consumer buying new from a trader: statutory protections are aimed at consumer-trader relationships. Where a seller promises a specific performance standard (for example a smartphone that lasts a full day on a single charge) and the device fails shortly after purchase, the student should identify whether the statement was a term or a mere representation, which implied terms under the Consumer Rights Act may have been breached, whether the short-term right to reject applies, and whether the trader’s offer to repair is sufficient. Common traps include forgetting to discuss the burden of proof in early post-delivery defects, neglecting to explain why a clause might not have been incorporated, and failing to address mitigation when advising on damages.

## Exam technique
Plan your answer before you write by quickly identifying the legal issues raised by the facts. Use a clear structure for each issue: state the rule (statute or leading case), apply it to the facts, and then reach a reasoned conclusion — this IRAC approach demonstrates AO1, AO2 and AO3. Where the question asks for advice, write as if addressing the client, showing likely outcomes and practical steps (for example, time limits for rejection under the Consumer Rights Act or the need to mitigate loss). When dealing with statutory provisions, name the implied terms and explain the appropriate statutory remedy, indicating any time limits or presumptions of proof. Always consider possible defences or limiting factors such as incorporation of exclusion clauses and whether they can survive statutory control. For evaluation and higher-mark answers, weigh policy and justice: explain why the law takes a particular approach, note tensions such as freedom of contract versus consumer protection, and suggest whether reform might be desirable. Manage your time so that long scenario questions receive proportionately more attention, and support every assertion with legal authority or principle rather than unsupported statements. Finally, write legibly and conclude each answer with a concise, clearly signposted conclusion that answers the question posed.
