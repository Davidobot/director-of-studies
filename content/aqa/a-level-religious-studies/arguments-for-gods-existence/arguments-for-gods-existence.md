# Arguments for God's existence (design, ontological, cosmological) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview
Arguments for God's existence form a major strand in the philosophy of religion and are central to the AQA A‑level syllabus. They attempt to show, by reason rather than revelation, that belief in God is rationally supported. The three classical types studied here are the design (teleological) argument, the ontological argument and the cosmological argument. Each has a distinct method: the design argument is a posteriori, reasoning from observed features of the world; the ontological argument is a priori, seeking to show that the concept of God entails God’s existence; the cosmological argument reasons from the existence or structure of the universe to a necessary first cause. Understanding each argument requires knowing its form, representative proponents and critics, and its philosophical strengths and weaknesses. For exam purposes it is also important to be able to weigh how persuasive each argument is for different kinds of thinkers and how they interact with scientific and theological claims.

## The design argument (Paley and Hume)
The classic presentation of the design argument in the syllabus is William Paley’s watch analogy. Paley asks you to imagine finding a watch on a heath. From the watch’s complexity, regularity and apparent purpose, you would infer a watchmaker. By analogy, the natural world—its intricate parts, apparent purposive order (for example, the eye or the laws of nature)—points to an intelligent designer, which Paley identifies as God. The argument is often framed as an inference to the best explanation: complex, regular order is better explained by intentional design than by chance.

David Hume, writing before Paley but known for influential criticisms, objects that the analogy between human artifacts and the universe is weak. We have experience of human designers making watches, but no experience of universe‑making, so the strength of the comparison is limited. Hume also points out alternative explanations: order could be the result of natural laws, or the designer might be imperfect, or there could be many designers. Further, the presence of apparent faults and suffering in the world makes the conclusion that the designer is wholly good and powerful problematic.

In modern discussions the design argument is sometimes presented as a fine‑tuning argument: physical constants of the universe appear finely balanced to allow life, and this improbability is taken to support design. Responses include the anthropic principle (we observe these conditions because only such conditions permit observers), possible multiverse explanations, and the challenge of probabilistic reasoning in cosmology. The design argument’s strengths lie in its intuitive appeal and its connection to empirical observation; its weaknesses include its reliance on analogy, the problem of evil, and scientific alternatives that explain order without positing a designer.

## The ontological argument (Anselm, Gaunilo, Kant)
The ontological argument is an a priori argument that aims to establish God’s existence from the very concept of God. St Anselm’s formulation in the Proslogion asks us to consider God as “that than which nothing greater can be conceived.” Anselm argues that existing both in the understanding and in reality is greater than existing only in the understanding; hence if God exists in the mind as the greatest conceivable being, God must also exist in reality. The force of the argument is that existence is part of the maximal greatness of God, so denying existence would contradict the very concept of God.

Gaunilo, a contemporary of Anselm, replied with a parody: imagine a perfect island than which none greater can be conceived; by Anselm’s logic this island must exist, which is absurd. Gaunilo’s criticism aims to show that Anselm’s move illegitimately treats existence as a property that can be simply added to a concept.

Immanuel Kant later attacked the ontological argument more systematically by arguing that existence is not a predicate or a property that adds to the concept of a thing. Saying that something exists does not add to its description; it only posits the instance of that concept. Therefore, existence cannot be used to move from conceptual possession of perfection to actual existence.

There are later developments, including modal versions of the argument that use possible worlds language to claim that if a maximally great being is possible, then it exists necessarily. These modern versions are philosophically interesting but remain controversial. The ontological argument’s distinctive strength is its logical elegance: if the premises are accepted, the conclusion follows a priori. Its major weaknesses arise from disputes over whether existence can be treated as a predicate and over the plausibility of the initial conceptual claims.

## The cosmological argument (Aquinas: contingency and necessity; criticisms)
Thomas Aquinas’ Way 3, emphasised in the specification, is a cosmological argument built around contingency and necessity. Aquinas observes that things in the world come into being and pass away; they are contingent, their existence is not necessary. If everything were contingent, there would be a time when nothing existed, and nothing would ever come to exist. Therefore there must be a necessary being—one whose existence does not depend on anything else—to ground the existence of contingent beings. This necessary being is identified with God.

The cosmological argument can be formalised in different ways: some appeal to a causal chain of causes requiring a first cause (the “uncaused cause”), others to the Principle of Sufficient Reason (every contingency requires an explanation) culminating in a necessary being as the ultimate explanation.

David Hume raised powerful objections. He questioned the universal application of causal principles: just because we observe cause and effect within the universe does not mean that causal explanation applies to the universe as a whole. He argued that the causal principle is not logically necessary. Bertrand Russell expressed a similar challenge: why should the universe require an explanation in terms of a God, rather than being a brute fact? He also famously reversed the request by asking, “What caused God?” while defenders reply that God, by definition, is a necessary being and so requires no cause.

Another philosophical concern is the fallacy of composition—moving from the fact that every member of a collection has a property (is contingent or caused) to the claim that the collection as a whole must have that property. Even if every thing within the world is contingent, it does not obviously follow that the world itself is contingent in the relevant sense. Furthermore, even if a necessary being is established, it does not follow short of further argument that this being has the attributes classical theism ascribes to God (omnipotence, benevolence, personal agency). The cosmological argument’s appeal is its grounding in common observations about change and dependence; its limits are metaphysical assumptions and the leap from “a necessary explanation” to “the God of classical theism.”

## Comparative evaluation and relation to faith
Each argument has different strengths and vulnerabilities and they play different roles for religious belief. The design argument is empirically grounded and can feel consonant with scientific reasoning, yet it struggles with naturalistic explanations and the problem of evil. The ontological argument has the advantage of being purely conceptual and therefore not vulnerable to empirical refutation, but its premises about existence as a perfection or predicate are philosophically contested. The cosmological argument connects with everyday intuitions about causation and contingency, but it depends on metaphysical principles some critics reject and it may not deliver the full character of a theistic God.

For many theists these arguments are not intended to provide airtight “proofs” in the mathematical sense but to offer rational support, plausibility and intellectual foundations for faith. Natural theology seeks to use reason and observation to argue for God, while revealed theology appeals to scripture and experience. Some religious thinkers (fideists) argue that faith is ultimately independent of reason, whereas others view reason and faith as complementary. In exam responses it is useful to show awareness of this relationship: arguments from design, ontology and cosmology can strengthen faith or make belief intellectually respectable, but they rarely displace the role of personal religious experience, community practice and doctrinal revelation for committed believers.

## Teaching points and classroom examples
When teaching these arguments, start with clear, familiar examples. Use Paley’s watch to make the design argument vivid, and contrast it with an example of natural selection producing apparent design without a designer to explore Humean and Darwinian responses. For the ontological argument ask students to try Gaunilo’s island exercise themselves to see the force of a parody. Working through Kant’s claim about predicates can be helped by examples that show the difference between describing something and asserting its existence. For Aquinas, a domino or chain reaction analogy helps; ask students to imagine an infinite regress of dependent things and whether that seems explanatory.

Encourage students to use the vocabulary expected by AQA: a priori/a posteriori, necessary/contingent, analogy, predicate, inference to the best explanation, fallacy of composition. Bring in contemporary debates without losing sight of the core texts: the fine‑tuning discussion is a modern form of the design argument; modal ontological arguments are a modern development; scientific cosmology (Big Bang) has renewed interest in cosmological reasoning but does not automatically vindicate theological conclusions. Use short extracts or paraphrases from Anselm, Paley, Aquinas, Hume and Kant to anchor analysis, but avoid over‑reliance on quotation. Illustrate counterarguments and defenses so students learn to weigh claims rather than merely recite them.

## Exam technique
Answering AQA A‑level questions on these arguments requires careful AO1 and AO2 work. For AO1 show clear knowledge and understanding: define each argument, explain its logical steps and use precise terminology, and name relevant thinkers (Anselm, Paley, Aquinas, Hume, Kant). For AO2 evaluate by giving well‑exemplified strengths and weaknesses, engaging with objections and possible replies, and demonstrating the wider implications for religious belief. Structure longer answers into clear paragraphs: start with a brief introduction that locates the argument, develop a section of explanation, follow with a section of evaluation, and end with a concise, balanced conclusion that answers the question set. When a question asks for comparison or synoptic links, make explicit connections between arguments (for example, contrast the ontological argument’s a priori method with the design argument’s empirical approach) and, where appropriate, link to other topics in the specification such as the relationship between reason and faith or responses to science.

Time management matters: in a three‑hour paper allocate time according to marks, and in two‑part questions use the first part to demonstrate solid AO1 and reserve time for the evaluative second part. Use scholars’ names to score AO2 marks, but ensure their ideas are explained and assessed rather than simply dropped into the answer. Avoid overlong quotations; instead paraphrase and explain. In evaluative paragraphs consider both immediate philosophical objections and the broader theological consequences, and aim to finish with a balanced judgement that recognises the argument’s significance even while noting its limitations.
