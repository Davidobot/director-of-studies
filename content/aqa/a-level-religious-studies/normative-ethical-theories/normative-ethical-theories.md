# Normative ethical theories (Natural Law, Situation Ethics, Virtue Ethics) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: what normative theories do and why these three matter
Normative ethical theories try to explain how we should decide what is right and wrong. They offer different starting points: rules and duties, consequences and goals, or the character of the moral agent. Natural Moral Law, Situation Ethics and Virtue Ethics are three central approaches you must be able to describe, apply and evaluate for A-level Religious Studies. Natural Law represents a classic deontological and theistic tradition associated with Thomas Aquinas, Situation Ethics is a mid-20th century teleological Christian response associated with Joseph Fletcher that puts agape (self-giving love) at the centre, and Virtue Ethics reaches back to Aristotle and focuses on moral character and flourishing (eudaimonia). Each approach gives a distinct answer to what makes an action right: conformity with rational moral order, acting in love in particular circumstances, or expressing the virtues of a good person.

## Natural Moral Law: Aquinas, primary and secondary precepts, and the principle of double effect
Natural Moral Law (NML) begins from the idea that there is an objective order to the world grounded in reason and, in the classical Thomistic account, ultimately in God. For Aquinas human beings can use reason to discern basic goods that are part of human flourishing. These central goods are commonly summarised as the primary precepts: to preserve life, to reproduce, to educate offspring, to live in society and to worship God. From these primary precepts follow secondary precepts, which are applications worked out by reason for particular situations. The doctrine is teleological in the sense that it sees actions as ordered toward ends; it is deontological because some acts are intrinsically contrary to the good and so prohibited.

A key practical tool within NML is the principle of double effect. This is used to distinguish intended outcomes from foreseen but unintended side effects. An act that has a good intention and a good means may be permissible even if it has a harmful side effect, provided that the bad effect is not the means to the good and there is a proportionately grave reason. For example, administering high doses of pain relief to a terminally ill patient may be allowed if the intention is to relieve pain and not to cause death, and if the relief outweighs the foreseeable risk. Natural Law has been developed and defended in many religious traditions and also adapted in modern Catholic moral theology; later thinkers also introduced proportionalist ideas which attempt to allow weighing of goods and evils when strict rule-following seems to lead to unjust outcomes.

Natural Law’s strengths include its claim to moral objectivity, clarity about what counts as the basic goods, and its integration of reason and human nature. Critics argue that NML can be too rigid, that it depends on controversial claims about human nature, and that the status of secondary precepts can be uncertain. When applied to theft or lying, a classical natural law approach will typically treat such acts as wrong because they conflict with goods like justice and truthfulness. However, natural law theorists might allow for complex cases if a proportionate reason exists or under the double effect principle, though many natural law traditions maintain certain absolutes (for example the intrinsic wrongness of direct killing or deliberate lying) which can lead to moral tension in life‑and‑death scenarios.

## Situation Ethics: Fletcher’s agape-centred, contextual approach
Situation Ethics emerged in the 1960s as a Christian ethical position that reacted against both legalistic rule-following and impersonal consequentialism. Joseph Fletcher argued that the only thing intrinsically good is agape, Christian self-giving love, and that moral decision-making must focus on achieving the most loving result in each situation. For Fletcher moral laws are not absolute; instead love becomes the sole norm that decides rightness. He presented a set of working principles emphasising pragmatism (what works to promote love), relativism (rules are relative to love), personalism (people come before laws), and positivism (accepting agape as the starting point).

Situation Ethics is unmistakably context-sensitive. A decision that would be wrong under a rule-based system might be right if acting otherwise would fail to express love. The classic example often used is lying to a murderer to protect an innocent life: rule ethics condemns lying, but situation ethics permits it because love demands protecting life.

Strengths of Situation Ethics include its flexibility, its focus on human welfare, and its insistence that moral reasoning be person-centred rather than rule-bound. Weaknesses include the charge of subjectivity—it can be difficult to adjudicate what counts as the most loving action—along with concerns that placing love as the sole criterion can justify clearly immoral acts if someone judges them “loving.” Religious critics question whether Fletcher’s reduction of morality to a single principle of love is adequate for a complex moral world. When applied to theft and lying, Situation Ethics can permit these acts if they demonstrably serve love: stealing to feed one’s starving family or lying to protect someone’s life can be judged right in context, but the approach requires careful, honest reasoning about consequences and relationships.

## Virtue Ethics: Aristotle, eudaimonia, the golden mean and practical wisdom
Virtue Ethics shifts focus from rules and outcomes to the moral character of the agent. Aristotle’s original account asks what sort of life leads to eudaimonia—flourishing or human well-being. Virtues are excellences of character, habits formed by repeated action that strike a mean between extremes. Courage, for example, is the mean between cowardice and recklessness. Moral education, role models and habituation are essential: virtues are acquired through practice, not simply by following rules.

A central concept is phronesis, or practical wisdom: the capacity to judge correctly how to act virtuously in particular situations. Aristotle’s account is teleological inasmuch as virtues aim toward the good life, but it is different from consequentialism because it is not primarily about maximizing outcomes; rather it is about the formation of character that reliably aims at the good.

The modern revival of virtue ethics responds to perceived limits of both rule-based and consequentialist frameworks. Contemporary virtue ethicists also explore how virtues can be integrated into religious traditions (for example Christian theology’s theological virtues of faith, hope and charity) and how communities shape moral character.

Strengths of virtue ethics are its emphasis on moral development, moral motivation, and the role of community and exemplars. It captures moral complexity and the importance of integrity. Criticisms include that it may provide insufficient guidance for specific actions, that different cultures prize different virtues, and that it can be unclear how to resolve conflicts between virtues. Applied to theft and lying, a virtue ethicist asks how a virtuous person would act. Lying and stealing are typically vices because they undermine trust and justice, but in particular circumstances a virtuous agent exercising phronesis might judge that telling a lie or taking something is necessary to protect life or restore justice. The focus is on the agent’s motives and character rather than on the act alone.

## Comparing the three: rules, love and character in moral decision-making
The three theories give distinctive routes to moral judgement. Natural Law privileges reason and a set of objective goods; it tends to produce rules and sometimes absolutist prohibitions, although tools like the double effect and developments such as proportionalism introduce nuance. Situation Ethics rejects fixed rules in favour of loving outcomes, emphasising context and relationships; it can be highly flexible but risks subjectivity. Virtue Ethics concentrates on the moral agent, habits and flourishing; it asks what kind of person one should become and invites long-term moral formation rather than episodic rule-following.

In relation to intention and outcome, Natural Law gives strong weight to intention and the moral quality of the act itself, Situation Ethics gives priority to the outcome judged by love, and Virtue Ethics foregrounds the agent’s character and practical wisdom. These differences matter when tackling real dilemmas: a situation that seems clearly right under Situation Ethics might be condemned by a strict Natural Law approach, while Virtue Ethics invites reflection on whether performing that act would cultivate or damage the virtues essential for human flourishing.

When evaluating these theories it is helpful to consider consistency, applicability, moral motivation and the role of communities and traditions. Natural Law’s claim to objectivity is attractive to those who want moral certainty; Situation Ethics’ concern for persons and relationships speaks to empathy and pastoral sensitivity; Virtue Ethics’ focus on character resonates with education and formation. A balanced critical response often recognises the insights of each while pointing to their respective limitations.

## Examples and applications: theft, lying and life‑and‑death choices
Putting theory into practice is a vital exam skill. Consider the example of lying to hide refugees from a persecutor. A classical Natural Law stance often treats lying as intrinsically wrong because it undermines the primary good of truth and social trust; however, some Thomist developments allow for complex judgements when higher goods or duties conflict, and the double effect can be invoked when harm is unintended. Situation Ethics would likely permit the lie because saving lives is the loving action. A virtue ethicist asks whether lying in this context expresses virtues such as compassion and courage and whether it would be the action a person of practical wisdom would choose.

For theft to feed a starving child, Natural Law again raises the importance of justice and the protection of property, but secondary precepts and proportional reasoning might allow exceptions if preserving life is at stake. Situation Ethics would evaluate the concrete loving response. Virtue Ethics would look to virtues of generosity and justice, balancing them by phronesis.

Life-and-death scenarios, such as withdrawing life-prolonging treatment, are a classic battleground between theories. Natural Law tends to distinguish ordinary from extraordinary means and allows withdrawal of disproportionate treatment under some interpretations; Situation Ethics would focus on the loving, compassionate choice; Virtue Ethics would emphasise caretaking virtues and the moral character demonstrated in difficult decisions. Knowing how each theory would approach such real cases and being able to compare and critique their responses is essential for high-scoring answers.

## Strengths and criticisms useful for evaluation
Each theory has characteristic strengths to deploy in evaluation. Natural Law offers moral grounding and coherence between human nature and moral law, but can seem inflexible and biased by historically contingent ideas of “nature.” Situation Ethics brings compassion and a focus on persons, yet struggles with standards for deciding what counts as love and how to prevent abuse of its flexibility. Virtue Ethics restores the moral agent and community, highlighting education and exemplary lives; critics worry that it gives limited action-guidance and can vary across cultures.

A strong evaluation will not merely list weaknesses but explain their consequences, offer counter-arguments, and sometimes suggest hybrid responses. For example, one might argue that combining virtue formation with some rule-like safeguards can secure both moral development and protection against subjectivity. Alternatively, pointing to how religious traditions themselves integrate elements of rule, love and character (for instance, Christian ethics locating virtues within commandments and love) can show nuanced understanding.

## Exam technique
Answering AQA-style questions requires clear AO1 (knowledge and understanding) and AO2 (analysis and evaluation) skills. For the 10-mark AO1 part of two-part questions aim to give concise, accurate definitions and explanations: define the theory, name its key features, and mention founding thinkers (Aquinas, Fletcher, Aristotle) and technical terms (primary/secondary precepts, agape, eudaimonia, phronesis, double effect). Use one well-developed example to show application. For the 15-mark AO2 essay develop evaluation: present strengths and weaknesses, consider at least one counterargument, and offer a brief conclusion weighing the evidence.

Structure helps markers follow your reasoning. For 15-mark responses use an introduction that defines terms and outlines the argument, two or three development paragraphs with analysis and evaluation, a counterargument paragraph, and a short conclusion that answers the question directly. For 25-mark synoptic questions engage more widely: bring in relevant religious perspectives or another ethical theory where appropriate, show depth (detailed critique, implications for real-life issues), and reach a supported judgement. Demonstrate breadth by linking moral theory to practice and to belief systems covered in the specification.

Always use specialist vocabulary accurately, signpost your structure with brief connecting phrases, and embed examples to show application. For full marks in AO2 you must do more than list criticisms: explain why they matter and how a theorist might reply. Time management is crucial: practise writing a clear 10/15/25 mark answer within timed conditions, and when possible plan for two minutes before writing to set out your structure and key points.
