# Applied ethics: human and animal life (abortion, euthanasia, animal use) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: scope and concepts
Questions about human and animal life sit at the heart of applied ethics because they force us to balance competing moral values: the protection of life, respect for autonomy, relief of suffering, duties to future generations, and our obligations to non-human creatures. The topics students must understand include abortion, embryo research, cloning and “designer” babies, euthanasia and assisted suicide, capital punishment (where it intersects with sanctity of life), and the use of animals for food, sport and scientific procedures. To analyse these issues properly you need a clear grasp of key concepts such as sanctity of life, personhood, viability, autonomy, stewardship, and ahimsa. You also need to understand how different moral theories would approach dilemmas and how religious traditions influence both the moral reasoning and public policies in particular societies.

## Key ethical theories and tools for decision-making
AQA requires familiarity with a range of normative ethical theories and with methods used to resolve difficult moral choices. Natural Moral Law, rooted in the thought of Aquinas, appeals to human purpose and basic goods; it emphasises absolute moral rules (for example, the wrongness of intentional killing) and makes room for the principle of double effect when a harmful side‑effect is unintended. Situation Ethics, associated with Fletcher, rejects fixed rules and prioritises agapeic love, so moral decisions are made case by case. Virtue ethics, drawing on Aristotle, looks less at rules and outcomes and more at the character traits (compassion, temperance) a moral agent should cultivate. Utilitarianism (Bentham and later Mill) evaluates actions by their consequences: the best action is that which produces the greatest overall utility, often framed as pleasure or reduced suffering. Kantian deontology focuses on duty and the intrinsic dignity of rational agents, stressing universal moral laws and the imperative never to treat persons merely as means. In addition, students should be comfortable with basic meta-ethical positions: Divine Command Theory locates right and wrong in God's will; naturalism and utilitarian forms of moral realism define moral good in terms of natural properties or consequences; intuitionism posits self-evident moral truths.

These theories provide differing answers to applied problems. For example, utilitarian reasoning can justify some forms of abortion or euthanasia where overall suffering is reduced, while deontological reasoning will often resist active killing regardless of consequences. Situation ethics may allow an action otherwise forbidden if it expresses agapeic love in the concrete case. Knowing how to apply and critically evaluate each approach is essential for examination answers.

## Abortion: definitions, arguments and ethical tests
Abortion raises questions about when human life acquires moral status, how to balance foetal interests against the pregnant person’s rights, and what counts as harm. Key distinctions students should use include those between early and late abortions, between elective and therapeutic abortion, and between “personhood” (moral status) and mere biological human life. The sanctity of life principle, commonly emphasized in many religious traditions, treats human life as intrinsically valuable; from this perspective abortion is usually morally problematic, though some traditions allow exceptions when the mother’s life is at risk. A rights‑based approach foregrounds the pregnant person’s bodily autonomy and right to privacy. Utilitarian arguments assess overall happiness and suffering: some utilitarians support abortion when it prevents significant suffering or hardship. Natural Moral Law tends to oppose abortion because it violates the primary precept to preserve life, though proportionalist revisions might permit exceptions. Situation Ethics focuses on love and could permit abortion if it is the most loving choice in the context. Debates also turn on biological markers such as conception, implantation, brain development, or viability as criteria for moral status; students should be able to explain why different markers are chosen and the philosophical consequences of each choice.

When evaluating, consider practical factors: socio‑economic context, consequences for dependants, the psychological effects on those involved, and legal frameworks designed to balance competing goods. Clear exam answers will show knowledge of the moral theories, apply them to specific scenarios, and weigh the strengths and weaknesses of each position.

## Euthanasia and assisted suicide: intentional killing and moral responsibility
Euthanasia and assisted suicide probe our attitudes towards ending life intentionally to relieve suffering. Distinctions matter: voluntary euthanasia (with consent), non‑voluntary euthanasia (when consent is unavailable), involuntary euthanasia (against the patient’s wishes), and assisted suicide (providing means for a person to end their own life). The principle of double effect sometimes figures in debates: administering pain relief that may shorten life can be defended if the practitioner’s intention is pain relief rather than death. Kantian ethics typically rejects euthanasia because it conflicts with duties to preserve rational life and treats persons as ends. Utilitarianism can support voluntary euthanasia where it reduces total suffering. Natural Moral Law is usually opposed, although proportionalist approaches may consider exceptional circumstances. Autonomy and dignity arguments stress personal choice and control over dying; opposing arguments emphasise the vulnerability of people under pressure, the sanctity of life, and potential social harms if euthanasia becomes normalised.

Legally, many jurisdictions distinguish assisted suicide from euthanasia and treat them differently. In a classroom answer, relate theory to practice: examine safeguards, the slippery slope worry, palliative care alternatives, and the role of conscience for medical professionals. Show how different ethical frameworks assess the permissibility of active versus passive life‑ending measures.

## Embryo research, cloning and ‘designer’ babies: future people, benefits and risks
Biomedical advances create morally fraught possibilities. Embryo research includes the use of spare IVF embryos for stem cell research that may yield treatments for disabling conditions. Cloning (therapeutic or reproductive) and genetic modification for enhancement or disease prevention raise questions about identity, parental roles, and the commodification of life. Natural Moral Law and many religious perspectives stress the inviolability of embryonic human life and oppose destructive embryo research and reproductive cloning. Utilitarians may argue in favour when research promises large‑scale reduction of suffering, balancing present harm to embryos against future benefit to many. Debates about “designer babies” focus on justice (who would have access), the authenticity of human relationships, and unintended consequences for social equality. Students should be able to explain regulatory responses and ethical frameworks such as the “precautionary principle,” the 3Rs (replace, reduce, refine) for animal research analogues, and the distinctions between therapeutic aims and enhancement.

A strong essay will analyse the moral status of embryos—whether they possess full personhood from conception or acquire status gradually—and will weigh the moral weight of potential cures against respect for nascent human life, including possible middle positions like allowing limited research under strict oversight.

## Animal life and death: moral status, rights and human obligations
Issues about animal life include their use for food, intensive farming, blood sports, scientific procedures, and the possibility of using animals as organ sources. Central to analysis is the moral status of animals: are they moral patients with intrinsic value, or primarily resources for human ends? Utilitarian thinkers such as those in the animal liberation tradition argue that the capacity to suffer grounds significant moral consideration and oppose unnecessary suffering in intensive farming and cosmetic testing. Concepts like speciesism identify unjust favouring of humans. Religious traditions offer varied responses: stewardship and dominion in the Judeo‑Christian tradition have been interpreted both as licence to use animals and as a call to responsible care; ahimsa in Hinduism and Buddhism emphasise non‑harm and lead many adherents to vegetarianism; Islamic and Jewish dietary laws regulate humane slaughter and show special duties to animals. Ethical regulation of animal research often appeals to the 3Rs to minimise harm and to frameworks that weigh human benefits (medical advances) against animal suffering.

When evaluating these debates, consider practicalities such as food security, public health, scientific progress, and alternatives to animal use. A persuasive revision answer will explore the moral reasoning of both animal rights and welfare positions and how religious and secular ethics inform policy choices.

## Religious responses and contemporary complexities
Religious traditions do not present monolithic views; within Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism there are internal debates shaped by scripture, tradition, and changing social contexts. Christianity often foregrounds sanctity of life but debates exist over exceptions (e.g. the mother’s life). Buddhism’s emphasis on ahimsa and karma leads to a general caution about intentional killing, but there are nuanced views about intention and compassion in difficult situations. Hinduism’s concepts of ahimsa and dharma influence attitudes to abortion and animal use, with practical diversity across castes and communities. Islam emphasises the sanctity of life and community responsibilities; debates about ensoulment and fetal personhood influence permissibility. Judaism balances the sanctity of life with pikuach nefesh (saving a life), which can prioritise the living person. Across religions, modern developments—medical technologies, secular legal systems, migration and pluralism—have prompted reinterpretations and fresh ethical reasoning. A strong revision response links doctrinal principles to how communities actually respond, showing awareness of diversity, contemporary pressures, and the dialogue between religious ethics and secular moral theories.

## Exam technique
In applied ethics questions aim to demonstrate clear understanding, analytical application, and balanced evaluation. Start by defining key terms and outlining the relevant ethical theories. Apply those theories to the scenario or issue with concrete reasoning: show how natural moral law would judge the action, how a utilitarian calculation might proceed, and how virtue ethics would focus on character. Use religious perspectives when asked, showing both typical interpretations and internal disagreements. Engage with counterarguments and consider practical consequences and legal or social contexts. For 25‑mark synoptic questions, structure your answer with an introduction that frames the debate, a body that systematically presents and analyses competing views, and a conclusion that weighs the arguments and justifies a reasoned position while acknowledging limitations. Throughout, use precise moral vocabulary, avoid sweeping generalisations, and exemplify points with realistic cases (e.g., late‑term abortion due to fatal fetal abnormality; a person seeking assisted suicide because of untreatable pain; a laboratory seeking to use animal models for a life‑saving therapy). Demonstrate critical awareness by questioning assumptions—about personhood, intention, and moral status—and show how different ethical systems prioritize different values. Finally, manage time so that AO1 content (knowledge and understanding) is clear and AO2 content (analysis and evaluation) is developed fully: aim to reserve the final quarter of your time to produce a concise evaluative conclusion.
