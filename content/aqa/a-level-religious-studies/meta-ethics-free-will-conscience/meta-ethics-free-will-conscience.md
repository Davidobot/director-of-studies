# Meta-ethics, free will and conscience (Divine Command, Utilitarianism, Intuitionism) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview of meta-ethics and why it matters
Meta-ethics asks questions about the nature of morality itself rather than which actions are right or wrong. It examines what we mean by terms such as “good”, “right”, “wrong” and “obligation”, whether moral statements express facts, feelings or prescriptions, and how moral knowledge (if any) is possible. For A-level study this matters because the answers students give at the meta-ethical level shape how they interpret ethical theories and religious moral teaching. If moral claims are simply expressions of feeling, then religious commands cannot be proofs. If moral values are non-natural and self-evident, then moral knowledge has a different character to empirical science. To revise this area well, make sure you can explain key meta-ethical positions in clear language, give concise examples, and show how each position supports or undermines particular normative theories and religious views.

## Key meta-ethical positions: cognitivism, non-cognitivism, naturalism and non-naturalism
A clear starting point is the distinction between cognitivist and non-cognitivist accounts of moral language. Cognitivists treat moral statements as truth-apt claims that can be true or false; non-cognitivists see them as expressions of attitude, prescription or emotion. Within cognitivism there is a further split between naturalists, who argue that moral properties reduce to natural, observable properties (for example, pleasure, well-being or human flourishing), and non-naturalists, who claim moral properties are irreducible features of reality discovered by intuition. Understanding these categories helps when you study Divine Command Theory (which treats moral rightness as rooted in God’s will), Utilitarianism (a form of ethical naturalism that identifies the good with pleasure or preference satisfaction) and Intuitionism (a form of non-natural cognitivism that treats moral truths as self-evident). Keep these schemata in mind when explaining or evaluating arguments: precise definitions and clear distinctions earn marks on AO1 and AO2.

## Divine Command Theory: form, strengths and problems
Divine Command Theory (DCT) holds that what makes actions right is that God commands them; what makes actions wrong is that God forbids them. This view connects moral obligation directly to a theistic source and is attractive because it promises an objective foundation for morality and explains moral authority: if God is the ultimate legislator, moral duties have binding force. DCT can be presented in a variety of forms, from a simple “right = commanded by God” to more sophisticated versions that try to avoid making morality arbitrary.

The classic criticism is the Euthyphro-style dilemma: is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is good? If the first horn is true, morality looks arbitrary—God could have commanded anything. If the second horn is true, goodness seems independent of God and the explanation DCT offers is undermined. Theologians have attempted responses: some deny the dilemma’s presuppositions by arguing God’s nature is goodness and commands flow necessarily from God’s essentially good character; others adopt modified DCT that ties commands to the divine nature rather than arbitrary fiat. Practical problems arise when religious commands seem to conflict with human moral intuitions or rights: historical and contemporary ethical controversies—such as laws based on religious edicts that discriminate—are useful case studies in evaluation.

When writing about DCT in an exam, make sure you explain the theory, illustrate it with a clear example (for instance, a religious command forbidding murder), then evaluate using the Euthyphro dilemma, worries about arbitrariness and divine hiddenness, and possible theist responses. Showing awareness of different versions of DCT and how they try to meet the dilemma strengthens your AO2.

## Utilitarianism as a form of ethical naturalism
Utilitarianism is a teleological, consequentialist and naturalist ethical theory that defines right action in terms of producing the best consequences—traditionally the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Classical utilitarianism, associated with Bentham, presents a hedonistic calculus: pleasure and the absence of pain are the only intrinsic goods. Mill refined this picture by distinguishing higher and lower pleasures and by defending rule-utilitarian approaches to avoid counterintuitive outcomes.

As a meta-ethical commitment, utilitarianism tends to sit with naturalism: moral terms refer to natural properties like pleasure, preference satisfaction or well-being, and moral claims can be studied empirically. This connection makes utilitarianism attractive in modern pluralist societies because it offers a single criterion for choosing between actions across differing belief systems.

Criticisms focus on demandingness (the theory may require extreme sacrifices), problems of justice (a strict utility calculus can justify sacrificing an innocent person if doing so increases overall happiness), and the difficulty of quantifying and comparing pleasures or preferences. The trolley problem and other thought experiments are useful tools in exams to test utilitarian responses; for example, would a utilitarian push one person to save five? Rule-utilitarians reply by endorsing general rules that maximise utility overall, but opponents argue this either collapses into act-utilitarianism or endorses rules that sometimes conflict with intuitive justice.

To evaluate utilitarianism effectively, show how its naturalist meta-ethics underpins real-world policy arguments (for instance, public health decisions) and probe its limits with examples where intuitive moral responses and utility calculations diverge.

## Intuitionism and non-natural moral properties
Intuitionism, as developed by G. E. Moore and others, is a non-naturalist, cognitivist meta-ethical view which claims that moral properties like “goodness” are real but not reducible to natural properties; they are apprehended by moral intuition. Moore’s “open question” argument suggested that no naturalistic definition of good can capture its essence because we can always coherently ask whether a proposed natural property really is good.

Intuitionism preserves the idea that moral knowledge is possible and objective without relying on God or empirical verification. It therefore supports ethical systems that appeal to self-evident duties. Critics challenge how intuitionists can account for moral disagreement, cultural diversity, and the reliability of intuitions. Empirical psychology suggests that intuitions are often shaped by emotion, upbringing and social context, which weakens claims of universal moral insight. Intuitionists respond by distinguishing basic, trained moral intuition from mere rash judgment and argue for reflective equilibrium—testing intuitions against principles and revising as needed.

In essays, present intuitionism clearly, give an example of a supposed self-evident moral truth, and weigh its strengths (simplicity, respect for moral realism) against objections about subjectivity and epistemic access.

## Free will and moral responsibility
Free will is central to moral responsibility: if agents are not free, it is hard to justify praise, blame, reward or punishment. The A-level specification expects familiarity with libertarianism, hard determinism and compatibilism. Libertarianism maintains that free will is real and incompatible with determinism; hard determinism denies free will because causal laws determine all actions; compatibilism argues that free will can exist even if actions are causally determined, understood as acting in accordance with one’s desires without coercion.

Each position has consequences for ethics and the criminal justice system. Hard determinists challenge traditional punitive responses and invite reformist or rehabilitative approaches. Compatibilists aim to preserve moral responsibility by redefining freedom in non-metaphysical terms. In exam answers, use concrete examples—such as someone who steals under coercion versus someone who steals from choice—to show how responsibility is more plausible in the latter case under compatibilism. Discuss modern challenges from neuroscience which suggest some mental processes operate unconsciously; these are controversial and do not straightforwardly prove determinism, but they provide useful material for evaluation.

Good responses explain the metaphysical positions briefly, then discuss implications for reward and punishment and the value of moral education. Drawing links to ethical theories—how utilitarianism might justify punishment by reference to consequences, while retributivism depends on free will—demonstrates synoptic thinking.

## Conscience: religious and secular accounts and its role in moral decision-making
Conscience is commonly described as the internal voice that guides moral decisions. Religious accounts often identify conscience with divine guidance or an internalised law: for some Christian thinkers conscience is the voice of God, while Aquinas distinguished synderesis (the innate principle of practical reason) from conscientia (the application of moral principles in specific situations). Non-religious accounts treat conscience as reasoned moral judgment (Kant’s practical reason resonates here) or as a psychological phenomenon shaped by upbringing and social norms (Freudian and sociological perspectives).

When considering the role of conscience in decisions such as telling lies, breaking promises, or adultery, it is important to balance respect for conscience with external moral standards. Religious traditions may give conscience a high status but also place limits where conscience conflicts with divine law or communal norms. Secular frameworks may defend conscience as a locus of autonomy, yet also subject to critique when it is used to justify harmful acts. In exams, illustrate with scenarios: a doctor whose conscience leads them to refuse participation in assisted suicide, or a whistleblower acting against organisational rules. Evaluate by asking whether conscience is a reliable moral guide, whether appeals to conscience can be overridden by law or communal ethics, and how conscience is cultivated through education and reflection.

## Comparative evaluation and synthesis
A strong revision approach is to compare the three meta-ethical positions across common criteria: objectivity, epistemology (how we know moral truths), practical guidance, and compatibility with religious belief. Divine Command Theory provides theological grounding but faces philosophical dilemmas about arbitrariness. Utilitarianism offers clear decision procedures and aligns with naturalism, but struggles with justice and quantification. Intuitionism preserves moral realism and resists reduction but must explain disagreement and the provenance of reliable intuitions. Connect these evaluations to practical ethical questions and to free will and conscience: for example, if moral value is God-commanded, conscience may be an organ for perceiving divine law; if morality is utilitarian, conscience is a utility calculator shaped by consequences; if intuitionist, conscience detects self-evident truths. Showing such syntheses demonstrates high-level understanding required for top marks.

## Exam technique
Begin each answer by defining key terms precisely and signposting your argument. For AO1, present clear, structured accounts of Divine Command Theory, Utilitarianism and Intuitionism, using brief examples to make the theory concrete. For AO2, balance explanation with evaluation: always give strengths and weaknesses, refer to critical thought experiments (for example, the Euthyphro dilemma, the trolley problem, and intuitionist critiques), and include responses from proponents to show depth. In longer essays, plan a clear line of argument—introduce your position, use paragraphs that each make one point with supporting examples, address counter-arguments, and end with a reasoned conclusion that judges the issues rather than simply summarising. Time management matters: spend the first few minutes planning, allocate time proportional to marks, and leave a short period at the end to refine key sentences and ensure your conclusion addresses the question. Use specialist vocabulary accurately but avoid over-complex phrasing; examiners reward clarity, precise evaluation and evidence of synoptic understanding linking meta-ethics, free will and conscience to practical ethical issues and religious perspectives.
