# Study of religion and dialogues (sources, identity, pluralism, secularisation) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: what this component assesses and why it matters
Component 2 of the A-level Religious Studies course asks you to study one religion in depth and to show how that religion both shapes and is shaped by philosophical and ethical thinking. You will need to demonstrate secure knowledge of beliefs, teachings, practices and sources of authority within your chosen tradition, and to show how those ideas connect with wider debates — about the nature of ultimate reality, the human person, moral decision‑making, religious language, science and the place of religion in contemporary plural societies. Exam questions test two abilities: first, clear accurate description and explanation of beliefs and practices (AO1); second, informed critical analysis and evaluation (AO2). Throughout your revision keep in mind the two dialogues: religion with philosophy of religion and religion with ethical studies. These require synoptic thinking: bringing together factual knowledge and conceptual reflection to explain influence, coherence, and challenge.

## Sources of wisdom and authority: what they are and how to read them
In every religion you study there is a set of texts, teachers and institutions that claim authority. These can be scriptures such as the Qur’an, the Bible, the Vedas or the Pali Canon; interpretative bodies such as the Talmud or Hadith collections; and living authorities like gurus, rabbis, imams or ordained sangha. Your answers should show the variety of views about the nature of authority. For example, some believers treat a text as the literal, inerrant word of God; others see revelation as inspired but expressed by human authors and therefore open to historical-critical interpretation. The role of translation and the cultural context of texts is important: words and literary genres shape meaning, and modern readers must decide how far ancient instructions are prescriptive, contextual or symbolic. Authority also takes institutional forms: churches, monasteries, madrasas and rabbinic courts all codify practice and interpret moral questions. When you explain a belief, show how sources and authorities sustain it and note internal debate where present — for instance, differing Sunni and Shi’a approaches to hadith and the authority of imams, or contrasting Protestant and Catholic accounts of the Bible and Church.

## Ultimate reality, self, death and the afterlife: major options and philosophical consequences
Religions offer distinctive answers to questions about ultimate reality and the human person, and these answers have philosophical consequences. Some traditions present a personal God who relates to creation, cares for human beings and will judge or redeem them; Christianity’s doctrine of the Trinity and the idea of resurrection exemplify this. Other traditions emphasise an impersonal absolute or ultimate such as Brahman in many forms of Hindu thought, or the Buddhist emphasis on Nirvana as beyond ordinary description. Concepts of self and personhood vary sharply: the Hindu notion of atman that participates in Brahman, the Buddhist doctrine of anatta which denies any permanent self, and the Abrahamic idea of an immortal soul all lead to different accounts of death, moral responsibility and what continuation after death might involve. Debates about resurrection versus reincarnation or about the possibility of personal survival raise philosophical issues about identity over time, the relationship between body and soul, and what it means to be the same person after radical change. In exams you should be able to outline the religious teaching, explain why it matters for believers, and then bring in philosophical questions about coherence, intelligibility and implications for ethics.

## Good conduct and key moral principles: how beliefs shape ethical choices
Religions provide frameworks for moral behaviour, often built around core concepts such as dharma, karma, mitzvot, shariʿa or the Eightfold Path. These frameworks shape how followers approach dilemmas about life and death, sexuality, wealth, environmental stewardship and treatment of animals. For example, the principle of ahimsa in Hinduism and Buddhism influences attitudes to vegetarianism, medical experimentation and warfare, while Christian concepts of sanctity of life and stewardship inform debates on abortion, euthanasia and ecological responsibility. Islam’s fivefold classification of actions within Shariʿa and Jewish pikuach nefesh (saving life) both show how law and principle interact in practical decision-making. A vital part of revision is understanding how religious moral systems relate to philosophical ethical theories: consider where a religion’s teaching fits with deontological (duty-based), teleological (consequence-based), or virtue ethics approaches. This opens up evaluation: is a religious ethic best read as rule-bound, as aiming at human flourishing, or as character-forming? How persuasive are religious responses to modern bioethical challenges like cloning or genetic engineering?

## Expression of religious identity, gender and sexuality: lived religion and changing roles
Religious identity is expressed through rituals, symbols, dress, community life and institutional roles. Baptism, puja, Salah, Hajj, pilgrimage to sacred rivers, synagogue worship and the monastic Sangha are all ways in which belief is embodied and transmitted. These practices change over time and interact with social factors: migration, colonial history, legal rights and the media all reshape religious life. Debates over gender and sexuality are particularly important in contemporary syllabi. Students should be able to trace how religious texts and traditions have been interpreted in different historical moments, and how feminist and queer readings challenge or reinterpret traditional teachings. Examples include the debates over female ordination in many Christian denominations, the revival of bhikkhuni orders in Theravada Buddhism, feminist reinterpretations of Jewish law, and Muslim feminist readings of contested Qur’anic verses. When answering exam questions, explain both the traditional teachings and the range of modern responses, showing how social change prompts theological reflection and institutional change.

## Religion and science, secularisation and pluralism: interaction and response in the modern world
The encounter with science and modernity is one of the major themes across religions. Scientific explanations of cosmology and evolution have prompted a variety of religious responses: some adopt a concordist approach that seeks harmony between scripture and science, others accept methodological separation, while still others remain opposed on doctrinal grounds. Prominent contemporary voices model constructive engagement, arguing that scientific insight and spiritual insight can enrich one another without collapsing into one another. Secularisation — understood as the declining authority of religion in public life, the privatization of belief or the displacement of religion by scientific and materialist worldviews — poses a further practical and intellectual challenge. Religions respond by renewing social engagement, adapting forms of worship, or by preserving traditional practices. Migration and pluralism create religiously diverse societies in which ideas about exclusivism, inclusivism and pluralism become live political and ethical questions. Religious traditions develop different attitudes to other faiths: exclusivist claims assert unique truth, inclusivism allows saving value beyond the tradition, and pluralism argues for the equal validity of multiple paths. Your answers should show how these responses affect interfaith relations, legal rights (freedom of religion), and the internal dynamics of communities living in multicultural settings.

## Dialogues with philosophy and ethics: how to connect beliefs and critical enquiry
The dialogue between a living religion and philosophy of religion asks how religious claims stand up to rational scrutiny. Key issues include the problem of evil, the intelligibility of miracles, the meaningfulness of religious language and the rationality of faith. Philosophical critique can prompt re-interpretation within a tradition, as when process theology rethinks divine omnipotence or when mysticism challenges the primacy of propositional claims. The dialogue with ethics asks how religious moral resources relate to secular ethical theories: does a religious ethic ultimately rely on divine command, on human flourishing, or on the cultivation of particular virtues? In answering synoptic questions you should demonstrate breadth by linking specific beliefs and practices to philosophical or ethical concepts, and depth by analysing tensions and offering evaluation. For example, when discussing the doctrine of anatta alongside personal identity theories, you should explain the doctrine, show its ethical implications (e.g. on attachment and compassion), and evaluate philosophical challenges about personal responsibility and moral praise or blame.

## Exam technique
Begin every answer by making your position clear: for AO1 aim for accurate, concise exposition of the belief, teaching or practice required by the question; for AO2 follow this with sustained analysis and balanced evaluation. Use specialist terms correctly and explain them in context. When describing a belief, include how it is grounded in sources or lived practice and why it matters to the community; when evaluating, discuss strengths and weaknesses, consider alternative interpretations and show awareness of internal diversity. For synoptic questions link material from Section A (study of religion) to relevant philosophical or ethical ideas, making explicit the lines of influence in both directions. Structure essays into clear paragraphs where each paragraph develops a single point and moves the argument forward; make sure longer answers include an introduction outlining your plan and a conclusion that summarises and judges the issues. Balance is crucial: avoid merely asserting your opinion; instead present evidence, anticipate counter-arguments and use scholars or tradition-specific examples where appropriate. Time management is important in three‑hour papers: allocate your time according to marks, leave time to plan higher‑mark answers, and if possible write a quick plan before each essay to keep your response focused. Finally, practise writing synoptic essays under timed conditions using past papers, and review examiner commentaries to get clear models of high-scoring responses.
