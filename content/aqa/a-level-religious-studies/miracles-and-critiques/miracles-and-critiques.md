# Miracles and critiques (Hume vs Maurice Wiles) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What we mean by a miracle
A clear start is to define what writers mean by “miracle.” Traditionally a miracle has been taken to be an event in which the normal course of nature is interrupted by a divine agent: a healing that cannot be medically explained, a person raised from the dead, or a highly improbable providential deliverance. Philosophers and theologians, however, use a variety of understandings. Some treat miracles as literal violations of natural law; others see them as extraordinary events that require new explanations, and a further group understands miracle stories as theological expressions or signs rather than empirical reports. For exam purposes, it is useful to be able to explain the “violation of natural law” view and the alternative interpretive or non‑interventionist views, because the two thinkers studied here—David Hume and Maurice Wiles—respond to miracles from different starting points: epistemology and probability in Hume’s case, and theological coherence and the doctrine of God’s action in Wiles’ case.

## Hume’s philosophical critique of miracles
David Hume’s famous argument about miracles is a classic piece of epistemic scepticism. Working from an empiricist framework, Hume defines a miracle as a transgression of the laws of nature by a particular volition of the Deity or by the interposition of some invisible agent. His central claim is probabilistic: the uniform experience of human beings establishes natural laws as extremely well supported by testimony and repeated observation, and any report of a violation of those laws must be weighed against that vast body of contrary evidence. For Hume the burden of proof lies on the person asserting the miracle. He argues that it is always more probable that the testimony is false—either through error, illusion, exaggeration, deception or the natural propensity of humans to be astonished—than that a law of nature has been violated. Hume then sets out conditions for credible testimony: the witness must be of good character, not be prone to wonder, have no motive to deceive, and the testimony must be supported by multiple independent witnesses. In practice, Hume thinks miracle reports rarely, if ever, meet these demanding standards; consequently, belief in miracles is irrational when based on human testimony alone.

## Maurice Wiles: a theological critique
Maurice Wiles approaches the question from within Christian theology rather than from an empiricist epistemology. Wiles was an Anglican theologian concerned with the coherence of Christian doctrine in a modern, scientific age. His principal move is to resist the idea that God intervenes in the world by suspending natural laws in arbitrary ways. He argues that to imagine divine action as sporadic “breaking” of the natural order makes God appear capricious and undermines the regular, ordered goodness of creation. For Wiles God’s providence should be understood primarily in terms of sustaining and enabling the processes of the world, not in terms of occasional supernatural intrusions that contravene scientific understanding. Consequently, miracle stories in scripture and tradition should be read as theological narratives that express the saving significance of events rather than as straightforward historical reports of law‑breaking. Wiles therefore rejects the appeal to miracles as necessary proofs of God’s existence or as the decisive foundation for Christian faith; for him the gospel’s core is God’s self‑communication in Christ and the meaning of that revelation, not a catalogue of supernatural violations.

## Where Hume and Wiles agree and differ
While Hume and Wiles come from different intellectual traditions and have different aims, their conclusions overlap in important ways. Both are hostile to the idea that miracles should be taken, uncritically, as reliable empirical evidence for the supernatural. Hume’s scepticism is methodological: he shows why testimony for miracles is unlikely to justify belief. Wiles’ scepticism is theological and pastoral: he worries that a theology dependent on suspension of natural law is theologically problematic and culturally implausible in an age shaped by science. The key difference lies in focus. Hume is concerned with how we know and what ought to count as good evidence; he offers an epistemic standard to reject miracle claims. Wiles is concerned with the doctrine of God and the intelligibility of divine action; he aims to reinterpret miracle narratives so that Christian belief can be sustained without appealing to breaches of natural law. Put simply, Hume says “the evidence doesn’t support miracles,” while Wiles says “we don’t need miracles understood as breaches of nature to be true to Christian faith.”

## Strengths and weaknesses of Hume’s position
Hume’s argument has the strength of rigour. It sets out clear epistemic criteria and insists that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This approach highlights genuine problems in relying on human testimony, including the psychological tendency to wonder, the cultural tendency to believe the marvelous, and the historical unreliability of isolated reports. Hume’s scepticism also protects scientific enquiry from being undermined by ad hoc exceptions to well‑established laws. The common criticisms of Hume point to potential inflexibilities. Critics argue that Hume presumes that all historical inquiry must be governed by the same standards as repeated experimental science, which may be too strict for singular, historically significant events such as alleged miracles. Some have suggested Hume’s argument is circular: he relies on past uniform experience to deny that there can be new kinds of experience. Others have shown how modern probabilistic and testimonial arguments—most famously Bayesian accounts and Swinburne’s principle of testimony—offer ways of making rational room for singular events when the balance of evidence or the reliability of witnesses is strong.

## Strengths and weaknesses of Wiles’ position
Maurice Wiles’ theological critique has the strength of taking seriously both the scientific worldview and the internal coherence of Christian doctrine. By denying that God acts by arbitrary interruptions of natural law Wiles aims to preserve God’s sovereignty and the intelligibility of creation, and to avoid making faith hostage to empirical anomalies. His approach helps many believers reconcile religious commitment with scientific knowledge, and it places theological emphasis on meaning, purpose and ethical transformation rather than on spectacle. Criticisms of Wiles, however, come from those who feel his reinterpretation strips miracle narratives of their historical and salvific force. For believers who understand the resurrection, healings or exorcisms as literal, decisive acts of God in history, Wiles’ non‑interventionism can seem to diminish God’s power and the unambiguous historicity of foundational events. There is also a methodological difficulty in deciding when a story is to be read theologically rather than historically: if all miracles become theological signs, it can be hard to retain any anchor in historical inquiry.

## Applying the debate to biblical examples
The different approaches can be used to analyse canonical miracle stories to good effect in essays. Take the feeding of the five thousand. Hume would ask for rigorous testimonial support, independent corroboration and the elimination of natural explanations; absent these, the extraordinary multiplication claim would be rejected as improbable. Wiles would invite students to ask what the story communicates about God’s providence, Jesus’ compassion and the ethics of sharing, rather than demanding an account that overturns natural law. The resurrection of Jesus poses a harder challenge. Hume’s method would again emphasise testimony and the implausibility of overturning death, while many interpreters influenced by Wiles would reframe the resurrection in soteriological and eschatological terms—as the unique, God‑made new mode of existence inaugurating a transformed creation—rather than as a mere resuscitation. In exam answers it helps to show how each thinker treats specific texts: Hume as sceptic about miracle reports because of epistemic criteria; Wiles as interpreter who wants scripture to function theologically within a credible framework of divine action.

## Contemporary responses and how to handle them
Since Hume and Wiles, several major responses have been developed that students should be aware of for evaluation. Philosophers of religion such as those who defend testimony and probabilistic reasoning have argued that, given credible testimony and appropriate corroboration, belief in a miracle can be rational. Theologians and philosophers who defend a “non‑interventionist” doctrine of God’s action argue for a continuity thesis—God acts through natural processes in ways that are not detectable by scientific methodology. Other approaches treat miracle claims as symbolic or mythic, emphasising meaning rather than factuality. When engaging with these responses, it is useful to weigh epistemic standards, the demands of historical method, theological coherence, and pastoral implications. Good evaluation recognises that different audiences (scientists, historians, theologians, congregations) will have differing standards and interests and that the debate is as much about what count as acceptable forms of explanation as it is about the events themselves.

## Exam technique
In an exam essay on Hume and Maurice Wiles, begin by defining ‘miracle’ and stating clearly whether you will use the “violation of natural law” definition, a more nuanced definition, or explicitly discuss both. For AO1 demonstrate knowledge of Hume’s core argument: the definition of miracle, the appeal to uniform experience and probability, the burden on testimony, and the rules for credible witnesses. For Wiles show his theological concern with the nature of divine action, his rejection of interventionist miracles as theologically problematic, and his emphasis on the meaning of miracle narratives. For AO2 evaluate both positions: set out the strengths (Hume’s epistemic rigour; Wiles’ theological coherence with science) and the weaknesses (Hume’s potential over‑strictness about singular events; Wiles’ risk of demythologising scripture). Use concrete examples such as biblical miracle stories to apply each thinker’s method and show how responses from other philosophers or theologians might challenge them. Conclude with a focused judgement that addresses the question, weighing evidence and implications for faith and reason. Manage time so that definitions and AO1 occupy the first third of your answer, sustained analysis and evaluation the middle third, and a concise conclusion the final third; clear signposting and careful use of specialist terms will show mature understanding.
