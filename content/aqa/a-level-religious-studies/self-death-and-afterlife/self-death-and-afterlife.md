# Self, death and afterlife (soul, reincarnation, resurrection) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Key terms and ways of thinking about the self
Students should begin by clarifying what is meant by the key terms used in this topic. The 'self' or a 'person' can be discussed in a variety of senses: as a physical body, as a stream of psychological states (memories, beliefs, desires), or as an immaterial soul that survives bodily death. The term 'soul' traditionally names an enduring, often non-physical principle of life and identity. 'Afterlife' covers any belief that personal existence continues in some form after biological death; this can include resurrection (a future, embodied life), immortality of an immaterial soul, reincarnation (rebirth into another body or form), or states in which personal identity is dissolved (for example, classical descriptions of Nirvana). Philosophical accounts of personal identity supply tools to assess these views: the bodily view identifies a person with a particular body; the psychological continuity view (associated with John Locke and developed by later philosophers) identifies persons with continuities of memory, character and psychological states; and the soul or substance dualist view identifies a person with an immaterial, simple substance that can survive bodily change. Knowing these distinctions is essential for answering exam questions that ask you to compare, evaluate or apply ideas about life after death.

## Substance dualism and Descartes’ argument for the soul
Substance dualism claims there are two fundamentally different kinds of substance: mental and physical. René Descartes is the classic advocate. He argued that the essential property of mind is thought while the essential property of body is extension in space; because the two have distinct essential properties, they can be conceived separately and so are distinct substances. Descartes also appealed to the claim that mental states are indivisible while bodies are divisible, so the self cannot be identical with any extended material thing. For students, Descartes provides a clear statement of a philosophical rationale for believing in an immaterial soul. It is important to set out the argument fully and then to examine its problems: critics ask whether conceivability entails possibility, whether divisibility is a reliable marker of metaphysical distinctness, and how an immaterial soul could causally interact with a physical brain. Contemporary neuroscience and philosophical accounts of mental causation pose particular challenges, but defenders of dualism respond by proposing interactionist models or non-standard accounts of causation. Exam answers should present Descartes’ reasoning, explain why dualism has intuitive appeal, but also be ready to assess the empirical and conceptual difficulties facing the view.

## Materialist and non-dualist accounts
In contrast to dualism, materialist or physicalist accounts identify persons with physical entities or processes. Reductionist physicalism claims mental states are brain states; functionalism describes minds in terms of roles or functions that could in principle be realized in different substrates; emergentist physicalism allows that conscious experience emerges from but is not reducible to physical processes. These views shift the burden of proof onto anyone claiming personal survival beyond brain death: if consciousness depends on brain processes, then ceasing brain function appears to end the person. Philosophical responses to this include the memory-criterion approach and psychological continuity theories, which can in principle allow for survival if psychological continuity is preserved in some way. Students should be able to explain how physicalism deals with cases such as brain injury, dementia and medically defined brain death, and to set out why many find physicalist accounts more compatible with scientific evidence while others find them unsatisfying because they appear to leave out something important about subjectivity and first-person experience.

## Reincarnation, karma and the Indian traditions
Reincarnation (rebirth) and the related doctrine of karma are central to Hindu, Buddhist and some other Indian religious traditions, but they are framed differently in each. In classical Hindu thinking the atman (self or soul) is often held to be eternal and to undergo repeated births until it attains moksha, liberation from the cycle of samsara. Advaita Vedanta presents atman as ultimately identical with Brahman, while dualist schools such as Samkhya treat atman and matter as distinct. The chariot analogy, used in the Upanishads and in later texts, helps to explain how the person might be distinguished from the body: the chariot is not identical with the rider's body, yet it houses the life that acts in the world.

Buddhism offers a strikingly different perspective: the doctrine of anatta or 'no-self' denies an enduring, unchanging soul. Instead the person is composed of five aggregates (skandhas): form, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness. The Milinda Panha (questions of King Milinda) famously uses the chariot analogy to argue that what we call a person is a convenient designation for a collection of parts, without an underlying permanent self. Rebirth in Buddhism is explained without positing a substantial self that transmigrates; rather, a causal stream of karmic formations conditions a continuing process so that actions have future consequences. Nirvana is sometimes described as the end of the cycle of rebirth and the cessation of suffering; Mahayana doctrines add complexities such as the Trikaya (three bodies) doctrine and the bodhisattva ideal, which influence how selfhood and continued existence are understood. Students should contrast literalist and metaphorical readings of rebirth, and consider how doctrines of karma provide moral explanation for the moral order across lifetimes.

## Resurrection, judgment and Abrahamic doctrines
Christian, Jewish and Islamic traditions each include beliefs about life after death, but they are not identical. Christianity has a strong strand of belief in resurrection of the body. New Testament texts and Christian theologians such as Augustine developed the idea that God will raise the dead and give a transformed, embodied existence; Paul’s letters set out theological arguments about the nature of resurrection bodies and their continuity with the person who died. Judaism has varied views historically: the Tenakh contains early, sometimes vague concepts of Sheol, while later Jewish thought includes beliefs about resurrection and the immortality of the soul; debates exist within Judaism about the literalness and timing of resurrection and the nature of the Messianic Age. Islam teaches an afterlife involving Barzakh (an intermediate state), bodily resurrection, judgment and eternal reward or punishment in heaven and hell. Across these faiths questions arise about whether continuing existence is best understood as spiritual disembodiment, transformed embodiment, or some combination, and whether heaven and hell are literal places, spiritual states, or metaphors expressing moral realities.

Philosophical debates here focus on how personal identity can be preserved in resurrection, whether God’s power could reconstitute a person even if parts are scattered, and what it would mean for identity to be both continuous and transformed. Christian accounts often emphasize both continuity (so the risen person is recognisably the same) and transformation (the body is glorified); these themes are important when evaluating theological claims about justice, judgment and the meaning of life.

## Evidence, religious experience and philosophical puzzles about survival
Students should be familiar with the kinds of evidence and argument that are offered for and against survival after death. Reported near-death experiences, visions, apparitions and other religious experiences have historically been taken by some as evidence of the soul’s survival. Philosophers and theologians respond by asking how to weigh testimony, whether such experiences can be explained neurologically, and whether they tell us about personhood after death or only about altered states near death. The philosophical literature introduces thought experiments and criteria for identity that test survival claims: Locke’s memory criterion suggests personal identity is a matter of continuity of consciousness and memory, while Derek Parfit’s work complicates the matter by focusing on psychological continuity and questioning strict identity over time. Problems include the possibility of multiple bodies associated with one memory pattern, the fate of personal identity under extensive change (dementia, brain split cases), and the epistemic gap between subjective experience and objective verification.

Students should work through classic objections to survival, such as the 'problem of other minds' (we do not directly perceive other minds), the dependence of consciousness on brain processes, and the empirical evidence that brain damage alters or destroys personality. Balanced answers will show that while empirical science gives weight to sceptical conclusions, philosophical arguments about personhood and the limits of empirical methods leave room for considered theistic or non-materialist positions.

## Ethical and pastoral implications
Beliefs about the self and life after death are not merely abstract. They shape attitudes to ethical questions such as euthanasia, capital punishment, the treatment of the dead, and how people cope with bereavement. A belief in reincarnation and karma may emphasise moral responsibility across lifetimes and encourage ascetic practices or social engagement to improve future rebirths. Belief in resurrection or an immortal soul can influence attitudes to the sanctity of life and to hope in the face of suffering. The doctrine of anatta in Buddhism encourages detachment from ego and can change how one understands moral responsibility and compassion. In exam answers it is useful to show awareness of these practical consequences and to reflect on how different metaphysical views support different ethical frameworks and pastoral practices.

## Exam technique
When answering A-level questions on self, death and afterlife, make sure first to identify exactly what the question asks: whether it requires description, comparison, evaluation, or application. For AO1 demonstrate clear, accurate knowledge: define key terms (soul, atman, anatta, samsara, resurrection), set out central teachings (e.g. five aggregates, atman–Brahman identity, resurrection of the flesh), and explain the positions of named thinkers where required (Descartes for dualism; Milinda or Upanishadic texts for Indian traditions; Paul/Augustine or Qur’anic concepts for Abrahamic views). For AO2 move beyond description to analysis and evaluation: weigh strengths and weaknesses of arguments, consider counter-arguments and alternative readings, and evaluate the significance of empirical evidence such as neuroscience or near-death reports. Use comparative material where helpful to illuminate contrasts and similarities—for example, compare the Hindu atman and Buddhist anatta, or contrast resurrection with reincarnation—and always illustrate abstract points with concrete examples or thought experiments (memory cases, brain injury, the chariot analogy). Structure answers with a clear introduction, logically ordered paragraphs and a conclusion that answers the question directly, showing balanced judgement. Finally, make sure to use appropriate specialist vocabulary accurately and to engage critically with sources: examiners reward clear explanation, precise use of terms and thoughtful evaluation that shows both knowledge and philosophical reflection.
