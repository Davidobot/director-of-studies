# Religious experience and verification (visions, numinous, Swinburne) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: why religious experience matters
Religious experience is central to how many people understand and respond to the divine. It covers single, dramatic encounters that change a life and quieter, ongoing states of awareness that shape belief and practice. In philosophy of religion the study of religious experience asks two linked questions: what kinds of experiences are reported and how should we assess their credibility? For A-level study you need to know the different types of experience that scholars identify, understand the philosophical issues raised by attempts to verify or challenge them, and be able to evaluate arguments for and against treating experiences as evidence for religious claims.

## Types of religious experience: a practical overview
Scholars group reported religious experiences in different ways to help analysis. Visions are experiences where something appears to the person, and these can be further divided into corporeal visions, where an external object seems present to the senses; imaginative visions, which are like vivid inner images; and intellectual visions, which are sudden insights or revelations that feel true without sensory content. The numinous experience is a specific kind of encounter emphasising a feeling of the wholly other, an encounter with a reality that is both awe-inspiring and beyond normal description. Mystical experiences are often described as unitive states in which the person feels a deep oneness with ultimate reality, sometimes losing the normal sense of self. Each type has distinctive features and raises different questions about how we should treat it as evidence.

## The numinous and Rudolf Otto’s contribution
The numinous focuses on the affective quality of certain religious encounters. The scholar who popularised this idea described it as an encounter with the “wholly other” that produces a complex mix of awe, dread and attraction. The numinous is not primarily cognitive; it is not a proposition or argument so much as an immediate emotional response to what seems like a transcendent presence. Key features often emphasised are ineffability (difficulty in putting the experience into words), a sense of mystery, and a feeling that the experience reveals something about the divine that ordinary experience does not. For believers the numinous can confirm the reality of God or spirit, and for philosophers it presents a puzzle: can such powerful, subjective feelings ever count as reliable evidence?

## Mystical experiences: James and Stace on union with the divine
Mystical experiences are often analysed using criteria that highlight their special character. One influential account describes them as typically ineffable, as carrying a “noetic” quality (a sense of revealing truth), as transient, and as often involving a sense of passivity where the experiencer feels acted upon rather than in control. Another approach distinguishes between extrovertive mysticism, where unity is perceived within the physical world, and introvertive mysticism, where the world falls away and only a central, unified consciousness remains. Mystical reports are important because they are not merely feelings but are taken by some to provide direct insight into ultimate reality. Critics argue that the ineffability and subjectivity of mystical states make them problematic as evidence, while supporters point to commonalities across cultures and the life-changing consequences they can have.

## Visions: corporeal, imaginative and intellectual
Visions are especially important in the history of religion because many foundational claims and sacred texts record visionary experiences. A corporeal vision involves sensory perception of something apparently external to the mind: for example, someone seeing an image of a deity or an angel that seems to occupy space. Imaginative visions are experienced within the mind as vivid images or scenes and can feel as real as perception without an external object present. Intellectual visions are sudden illuminations, a kind of immediate understanding or revelation that seems true without argument. The differences matter for verification: corporeal visions are, in principle, more easily checked by third-party testimony or physical traces, while imaginative and intellectual visions are typically private and harder to corroborate.

## Verifying religious experiences: challenges and scientific critiques
Verification of religious experiences raises familiar philosophical problems. Because many experiences are private and ineffable, they resist direct public inspection. The scientific perspective often seeks natural explanations: brain states associated with temporal lobe activity, hallucinations caused by illness or drugs, or psychological processes triggered by stress or social suggestion. Neuroscience and psychology can show that specific brain activity correlates with certain experiences, but correlation does not, by itself, disprove a religious cause. Historical and cultural conditioning is another major challenge: the content of many experiences often mirrors the experiencer’s religious background, suggesting that prior beliefs shape what is experienced. Fabrication and deceit are further possibilities where claims are deliberately manufactured. Philosophically, the problem is how to weigh private testimony, possible natural explanations, and the impact an experience has on a life.

## Swinburne’s principles: credulity and testimony and his probabilistic approach
One of the most influential modern philosophical responses to scepticism about religious experience is to apply ordinary epistemic principles to religious claims. The first of these is a principle of credulity: in the absence of special reasons to doubt, we should generally accept that our experiences are veridical. If you see what looks like a tree, you are justified in believing there is a tree unless you have reason to suspect illusion. Applied to religious experience, the principle suggests that experiencers are prima facie justified in believing what they report, unless there are defeaters such as evidence of hallucination or deceit. The second principle concerns testimony: we should normally accept other people’s reports of experiences unless we have reasons to distrust them. These two principles together push against the idea that religious experience can be dismissed out of hand.

Swinburne develops these ideas into a probabilistic framework. Rather than claiming that experiences prove religious claims conclusively, he argues that experiences contribute to a cumulative case that increases the probability that a theistic claim is true. In this view a single, isolated report may not be decisive, but many reliable reports, together with other evidence such as the existence of the universe and the presence of moral order, can raise the credibility of theistic belief. This approach makes religious experience part of a rational assessment rather than a stand-alone proof.

## Criticisms and limitations of Swinburne’s approach and responses
Swinburne’s principles have clear strengths: they accord respect to ordinary epistemic practice and avoid a double standard that treats religious experience as automatically suspect. However, critics raise several objections. One concern is gullibility: the principle of credulity might licence belief in unreliable reports unless strict criteria for defeaters are specified. The reliability of testimony can vary widely, and cultural shaping of experience raises the question of whether the content of religious reports is evidence for metaphysical claims or simply evidence of prior beliefs. Another critique focuses on the status of rival religious experiences: if Christians and Hindus and Muslims all report conflicting encounters of equal force, how can they all be correct? Swinburne responds by insisting that credibility should be judged case by case; competing claims reduce the overall probative force of any particular type of experience. Religious believers, meanwhile, may point to transformational outcomes—the way experiences lead to consistent moral change or sustained commitment—as indirect evidence supporting their validity.

## The influence of religious experience on faith and practice
Whatever one’s epistemic conclusions, religious experiences have undeniable practical effects. They can spur conversions, found movements, shape ethics, inspire art and worship, and form the basis for authority claims. Historical examples include dramatic conversion narratives that reorient a person’s commitments, and mystical traditions that shape communal practices. For many believers, an experience’s lasting transformative power is itself a kind of verification: if an encounter brings deep moral renewal or sustained spiritual fruit, it is taken as confirming that something genuine was received. Philosophically, this moves the debate into the area of pragmatic or existential criteria for truth: does the experience “work” in producing a life oriented toward what is judged good or true?

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on religious experience and verification you must show clear knowledge (AO1) and sustained evaluation (AO2). Begin short answers by defining key terms such as vision, numinous, mystical, and verification, and by naming relevant scholars (for example Otto, James, Stace, Swinburne). For the 10-mark AO1 part of a two-part question aim to give accurate explanations with one or two well-chosen examples—Paul’s road to Damascus or a mystical account will serve as useful illustrations. For the 15-mark AO2 part structure your response with clear lines of argument and counterargument: present Swinburne’s principles, explain their implications, then offer critical challenges such as cultural conditioning, neurological explanations and the problem of conflicting reports. Use comparative evaluation, weighing strengths and weaknesses and showing awareness of how a religious believer might respond.

In longer synoptic essays integrate material from philosophy of religion with study of religion where relevant: link the nature of experiences to their influence on believers and to other topics like miracles or religious language. Use precise specialist vocabulary, but explain terms when they first appear. Balance is crucial: do not merely describe Swinburne; assess how persuasive his probabilistic approach is and consider alternative responses. Conclude by answering the question directly, summarising which arguments you find most convincing and why. Manage your time so you have minutes to plan and minutes to review and edit short conclusions; examiners reward clarity, accuracy and thoughtful evaluation.
