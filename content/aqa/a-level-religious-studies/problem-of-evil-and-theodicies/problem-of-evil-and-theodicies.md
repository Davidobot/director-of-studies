# Problem of Evil and theodicies (Hick, free will, process) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## The problem of evil: definitions and the two key forms of the problem
The problem of evil asks how it is possible for an all-powerful, all-knowing and wholly good God to allow the existence of evil and suffering. In A-level work you need to distinguish clearly between natural evil and moral evil. Moral evil arises from free agents—for example murder, war or cruelty—where intentions, choices and responsibility are central. Natural evil refers to suffering that results from natural processes, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, disease and congenital disorders. Philosophers also separate the logical (or deductive) problem of evil from the evidential (or inductive) problem. The logical problem, sharpened in modern form by thinkers like J.L. Mackie, claims a straightforward contradiction: God’s attributes are inconsistent with the existence of evil. The evidential problem, defended by philosophers such as William Rowe, accepts that evil and God’s attributes could in theory co-exist but argues that the amount, kind and distribution of suffering provide strong evidence against God’s existence. Responses to these challenges are called theodicies or defences; understanding their aims and limits is essential to exam answers.

## Hick’s “soul‑making” theodicy: purpose, mechanism and implications
John Hick revived and reworked the Irenaean tradition to produce what is commonly called the soul‑making theodicy. Hick’s central claim is that God permits suffering because it is necessary for the moral and spiritual development of human beings. Creation is a “vale of soul‑making”: humans are made as creatures with potential for moral growth, and real virtues such as courage, compassion and patience require adversity to develop. Hick introduces the idea of epistemic distance: God deliberately maintains a degree of distance so that faith and freely chosen response are meaningful; a world of coercive miracles or constant divine intervention would remove genuine moral choice. He also insists on eschatological completion: the process of soul‑making may extend beyond earthly life, so ultimate justice and full moral transformation are realised in the long run—Hick’s view is compatible with, and often implies, universal salvation.

Hick’s theodicy has strengths for believers: it provides a purpose to suffering and preserves human moral agency. It addresses why God would permit natural laws and regular processes that can produce suffering: regularity is needed for moral responsibility and dependable action. However, critics press two main problems. First, the “horrendous evils” objection: some suffering (for example the Holocaust, or the protracted suffering of innocent children) seems so extreme that it is hard to see how it could be justified as soul‑making without appearing callous. Second, the insistence on an afterlife or ultimate compensation is controversial; it shifts the burden of justification to a future realm for which empirical evidence is absent, and it can feel unsatisfactory to victims who experience no apparent moral growth from their suffering. Finally, critics argue that Hick’s account can appear anthropocentric and struggles to explain animal suffering.

## Free‑will theodicies and the free‑will defence
The free‑will theodicy traces back to Augustine and finds a modern philosophical articulation in Alvin Plantinga and others. The basic idea is that God created moral agents with genuine free will, and the possibility of moral good logically entails the possibility of moral evil: to secure genuine freedom, God cannot cause creatures always to choose rightly. Plantinga’s “free‑will defence” shows that the mere existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good God is logically compatible with the existence of evil. He argues that it could be the case that every possible world in which free creatures always choose rightly is one God could not actualise because of “transworld depravity” (the hypothetical tendency of free creatures to go wrong in any possible world they are placed in). Plantinga’s work is important because it responded to the logical problem of evil by showing that theists need not be logically inconsistent.

Beyond the logical defence, notable contributors such as Richard Swinburne argue that the existence of regular natural laws is necessary for moral responsibility; if God repeatedly intervened to prevent every harmful event, human moral development and the predictability required for meaningful action would be undermined. Thus, some evils are permitted as the price of a world in which moral agency and reliable causal processes can exist.

Criticisms again focus on natural evil and the scale of suffering. Free‑will accounts explain moral evil, but natural evils that are not obviously linked to human choices are harder to justify. Attempts to link natural evil to human sin or to free will in a broader sense meet resistance. The free‑will defence has also been criticised for appearing to exonerate God too readily: it can feel like a legalistic response rather than an empathetic one, and it struggles when confronted with apparently gratuitous or pointless suffering.

## Process theodicy (Griffin): God’s power rethought and theodicy as accompaniment
Process theodicy, associated with thinkers in the Whiteheadian tradition such as David Ray Griffin, offers a different route by reconceptualising divine power. In process thought God is not omnipotent in the classical, coercive sense. God cannot unilaterally control all events; rather God lures, persuades and influences the world toward greater complexity, creativity and good. Griffin develops the idea of God as dipolar: God has a primordial nature (the source of possibilities and the lure toward value) and a consequent nature (God’s experience of the world, which includes suffering). On this model, God suffers with creation and works to bring about the greater good but cannot prevent all evil, because much of reality consists of autonomous processes and free agents whose choices have real causal efficacy.

The strengths of process theodicy are theological and pastoral: it preserves God’s love and compassion while making sense of a God who shares in creaturely suffering. It also fits well with a scientific, naturalistic picture of the universe because it removes the need for supernatural suspension of natural laws. Process theodicy handles animal suffering and ecological disaster more straightforwardly than soul‑making accounts because God’s power is reinterpreted rather than the evil being justified as pedagogical.

However, this model faces significant challenges for many theists. If God lacks omnipotence in the traditional sense, classical attributes such as sovereignty and creator‑lordship are altered, raising the question whether such a being warrants the title “God” in theistic religions that emphasize omnipotence. Critics argue that process theology may undermine prayer, divine promises and the hope that God can deliver miracles. Moreover, some claim that redefining God’s power is a theological retreat that avoids the problem rather than solving it.

## How theodicies respond to the logical and evidential problems of evil
Different theodicies address different philosophical tasks. Plantinga’s free‑will defence primarily targets the logical problem: it seeks to show that divine attributes and the existence of evil are not logically inconsistent. Hick’s soul‑making and process approaches are aimed more at the evidential problem: they try to make sense of why, given the amount and kinds of suffering in the world, a benevolent God might still be plausible. Hick explains why suffering can have a positive developmental role; process theology reframes God’s relation to power so that suffering is not inconsistent with divine love. Neither approach fully refutes the evidential argument, especially when the suffering appears gratuitous or horrendous; rather, they reconfigure the explanatory background so that the existence of suffering becomes intelligible, if still troubling. Good exam answers will distinguish whether a theodicy defeats a logical contradiction or merely offers a plausible theistic response to the evidence.

## Strengths and weaknesses: comparing Hick, free‑will and process approaches
Comparisons help clarify what each theodicy prioritises. Hick emphasises moral and spiritual growth and preserves classical divine attributes of omnipotence and omniscience, but at the cost of heavy reliance on an afterlife and difficulties with horrendous or non‑human suffering. Free‑will defences keep human freedom central and provide a sharp philosophical reply to logical critiques, yet they are weaker when explaining natural evils and the sheer scale of suffering. Process theodicy offers a compassionate God who is present with suffering and aligns more naturally with modern scientific understandings; its weakness is theological: if God is not omnipotent, this raises serious doctrinal questions for many believers.

Students should also be ready to bring in specific criticisms from scholars and examples from history or current events. The Holocaust is frequently used to test the strength of any theodicy; if a theodicy cannot offer a morally satisfying response to such cases, its persuasive power is limited. Similarly, attention to animal suffering or chronic, early‑life suffering of children poses specific problems for soul‑making and free‑will accounts but can be better accommodated by process approaches.

## The impact of these theodicies on faith and practice
Theodicies are not just abstract arguments; they shape religious life. Hick’s theodicy can encourage a focus on moral development and compassion, and it can bolster the hope of ultimate justice. Free‑will theodicies underpin many religious views about moral responsibility, repentance and the meaning of sin. Process theology can inspire an ethic of accompaniment and environmental stewardship because God is understood as suffering with creation and inviting cooperative action. Students should consider how a given theodicy influences worship, prayer, pastoral care and ethical decision‑making, because AQA assessment rewards attention to how ideas operate within religious communities as well as their philosophical coherence.

## Exam technique
When answering AQA-style questions on the problem of evil, begin by defining key terms concisely—natural/moral evil, theodicy/defence, evidential/logical problem—so the examiner sees clear AO1 knowledge. For a two‑part question, treat the first short part as targeted AO1: explain the view or argument directly, using the names Hick, Plantinga or Griffin where relevant and noting their key claims (vale of soul‑making, free‑will defence/transworld depravity, process God as persuader/sufferer). For the longer evaluative part, organise your answer into clear paragraphs that alternate explanation and critical evaluation. Use specific strengths and weaknesses, draw on counterarguments (for example, horrendous evils, natural evil, implications for divine omnipotence) and demonstrate breadth by comparing two or more responses. Always link back to the question: if it asks “How far…?”, give a balanced conclusion that judges the relative success of the theodicies rather than simply summarising them.

In synoptic or 25‑mark questions, make explicit links to other parts of the specification where relevant: connect theodicies to ethical issues (moral responsibility, punishment, compassion), to concepts of God (omnipotence, omniscience, benevolence) and to religious practice (pastoral care, prayer). Use precise scholarship and examples—historical events, scientific constraints, or religious responses—to illustrate points. Manage time so that for a 25‑mark essay you spend roughly 5–8 minutes planning, the bulk of time writing a structured answer with clear introduction, development and conclusion, and the final minutes reviewing. Finally, write with clarity and technical accuracy, using specialist terms correctly and signposting arguments so that both AO1 knowledge and AO2 evaluation are evident throughout your response.
