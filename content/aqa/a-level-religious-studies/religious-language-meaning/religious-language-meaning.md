# Religious language (verification, falsification, symbolism) (A-level Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What do we mean by religious language?
Religious language is the vocabulary, images and statements people use to speak about ultimate questions: God, the divine, transcendence, the meaning of life, salvation, sin and other matters that lie beyond immediate empirical verification. A key distinction for A-level study is between cognitive language, which aims to state facts that can be true or false, and non‑cognitive language, which expresses feelings, attitudes, commands, metaphors or symbols and is not straightforwardly true or false. Understanding religious language requires asking whether religious statements are making factual claims about reality, or whether they function differently — as expressions of commitment, as symbols pointing beyond themselves, or as part of particular forms of life in which they make sense.

## The verification principle and its challenge to religious statements
The verification principle emerged from logical positivism: the idea that a meaningful statement must be empirically verifiable, either directly or indirectly. On this view, a claim is meaningful only if there is some possible observation which could establish its truth. When applied to religious claims — for example, “God exists”, “Christ rose from the dead” or “God is omnibenevolent” — the principle appears to rule them out as literally meaningful because they cannot be tested by observation in the way empirical claims can. Proponents of verification argued that metaphysical and theological assertions are therefore cognitive failures: impressive in rhetoric, perhaps, but empty of factual content.

Students should note both the appeal and the limits of the verification challenge. It sharpens the demand that religious claims be clear about how they connect to evidence, and it influenced twentieth‑century debates about the status of theology. However, it also attracted criticism for being self‑refuting: the verification principle itself cannot be empirically verified, so on its own terms it would be meaningless. Teachers and examiners expect students to be able to explain the logical positivist move and to show why it provoked sustained responses from theologians and philosophers.

## Falsification: Flew and the parable of death by deathless denial
A related but distinct challenge focuses on falsification: for a statement to be meaningful it must be open to being shown false by some evidence. Antony Flew argued provocatively that many religious claims are formulated in ways that resist falsification. He suggested that believers often respond to counter‑evidence by modifying their claims so that nothing will ever count against them; over time, this process empties the claim of content. Flew illustrated this with parable‑like examples that force students to think about what would count as disconfirmation for a religious believer.

Responses to Flew produced an important strand of the debate. One reaction came from those who argued that religious assertions are not meaningless simply because they are not scientific hypotheses: they can have a different kind of rationality, rooted in trust, testimony, or in experiences that are not readily subject to scientific testing. Another reaction came from philosophers who suggested that many religious claims are in principle falsifiable, or at least are supported by kinds of evidence that matter for believers in a different register.

It is useful to compare falsification with verification: both raise questions about meaningfulness, but falsification focuses on the way beliefs resist counter‑evidence, while verification focuses on the positive conditions for meaning. Both moves push students to consider how religious language functions in practice and to weigh the consequences for faith and theology.

## Hare’s ‘blik’, Mitchell and the resistant believer
R.M. Hare introduced the concept of a “blik” to explain how some worldviews can be meaningful without being empirically verifiable or falsifiable in the ordinary sense. A blik is a basic, unfalsifiable but meaningful attitude or worldview — for example, a paranoid blik that sees all events as evidence of a hostile conspiracy. Hare’s point was that such attitudes shape how people interpret facts and give life coherence, even though they cannot be disproved by empirical data. Religious language, on this account, can function as a blik: it expresses a fundamental orientation to reality rather than putting forward testable propositions.

Basil Mitchell offered a different reply to critics who said religious beliefs were immune to refutation. He described the “resistant” believer who holds to faith even while acknowledging apparent counter‑evidence. Mitchell argued that religious claims are not empty because believers are willing to revise or abandon belief in the face of sufficient evidence, even though in practice their commitment may make them interpret evidence in a friendly way. These exchanges deepen the debate about whether religious language is cognitive, and they give students concrete ways to discuss the lived features of belief.

## Symbolism, analogy and the via negativa
If verification and falsification try to import scientific criteria into theology, alternative approaches accept that religious language operates on different levels. One influential idea is that religious language is symbolic. Symbols do not simply stand for objects; they participate in and open up realities that literal language struggles to capture. When a hymn says “God is my refuge”, the sentence functions symbolically to evoke trust and protection rather than to report a measurable fact. Symbols can be rich and multilayered, communicating what propositional statements may fail to express.

Analogy offers another way of making sense of religious predication. Rather than treating terms applied to God as entirely univocal (the same meaning as in human contexts) or wholly equivocal (completely different meanings), analogy suggests a middle path: words like “goodness” or “father” are neither identical in divine and human contexts nor entirely unrelated; they are related by proportion. This approach allows religious statements to be cognitively significant while acknowledging the transcendence of the divine.

The via negativa, or apophatic tradition, complements these views by insisting that the most accurate language about the divine is negative: we can say what God is not more safely than what God is. Saying “God is not finite” avoids the category mistakes that anthropomorphic language risks. The via negativa is powerful where analogy and symbolism might be accused of projecting human categories onto the divine; it preserves mystery but challenges communicative clarity.

## Wittgenstein and language games: meaning in use
Ludwig Wittgenstein’s later philosophy underpins a pragmatic approach to religious language: meaning is constituted by use within particular language games and forms of life. Religious statements are meaningful because they belong to practices — worship, prayer, moral teaching, liturgy — in which they have a role. To judge such statements by the standards of empirical science is to misunderstand the language game being played. On this account, asking for scientific verification is like expecting chess moves to be anatomically plausible; it misses how the game functions.

Wittgenstein’s view helps explain why religious language can be coherent and significant within communities even if it looks unintelligible from an outsider’s scientific perspective. It also prompts careful attention to context: the same phrase can mean different things in different traditions and practices. At A‑level, students should be able to explain how the language‑game approach offers a middle way between strict cognitive verificationism and total non‑cognitivism, while also noting charges that it may relativise truth or make interfaith critique more difficult.

## Strengths and weaknesses: evaluating the positions
Each approach to religious language brings strengths that are pedagogically valuable. Verification and falsification sharpen critical standards and encourage defenders of faith to clarify evidence and argument. Symbolic, analogical and apophatic approaches preserve the depth and mystery of religious discourse and explain how non‑literal language can be meaningful. Wittgenstein points to the practical embedding of language in life and community.

Counterarguments are equally important. Verificationism and strict falsification risk excluding much of what people find most important about religion and may be self‑defeating. Symbolic and analogy theories can be accused of drifting into subjectivity: if meanings are primarily expressive or participatory, how can we adjudicate competing religious truth claims? The via negativa safeguards transcendence but may render religious language too negative to support positive belief. Wittgenstein’s language games offer descriptive purchase but may seem to underplay truth claims that many religious traditions insist upon.

A balanced evaluation recognises that religious language is multifunctional. In some contexts religious statements aim to convey factual claims (for example, historical claims about particular events), while in other contexts they serve to express commitment, shape identity, or evoke the ineffable. Good A‑level responses will show awareness of this plurality, assess the relative success of each theory in accounting for different kinds of religious talk, and conclude with a judgement about which account (or combination) is most persuasive for particular purposes.

## Exam technique
To score well on AQA A‑level questions about religious language, start by identifying what the question demands: does it ask for explanation (AO1), critical evaluation (AO2) or both? For explanation, define key terms such as verification, falsification, symbol, analogy and via negativa, and show how they apply to clear examples — for instance, a creed statement, a hymn line, or a theistic claim. For analysis and evaluation, deploy thinkers and ideas you have studied to challenge and support the view named in the question, and make explicit the consequences of accepting each approach for religious belief and practice. Structure answers so that each paragraph has a clear point, evidence or example, and analytical comment. Where you compare positions, treat each fairly before weighing them against one another, and aim to end with a concise judgement that answers the question directly. Use specialist vocabulary accurately, quote short illustrative phrases when helpful, and balance description with evaluation throughout; examiners reward sustained, coherent argument that demonstrates both knowledge and critical engagement.
