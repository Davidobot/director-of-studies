# Water and carbon cycles (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## The systems approach: why cycles matter
Thinking of the water and carbon cycles as interacting natural systems gives you a powerful framework for understanding the physical world and human–environment interactions. A systems approach emphasises stores (or reservoirs), flows and transfers, inputs and outputs, energy drivers, feedbacks and the tendency towards dynamic equilibrium. It encourages you to describe and explain what changes, why those changes happen at particular rates and scales, and how human activities can perturb the system. In exam answers, using system language — naming stores, quantifying fluxes, identifying positive and negative feedbacks and explaining responses across time and space — will make your explanations precise and analytical. Both cycles operate at multiple scales, from the stomatal exchange on a leaf to exchanges between the atmosphere and deep ocean, and many contemporary issues in geography (flooding, water security, climate change, land use change) can be understood in terms of altered stores and disrupted flows.

## The water cycle: stores, processes and drainage basin functioning
The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water among the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere and biosphere. Major global stores include the oceans (vast and dominant), ice sheets and glaciers, groundwater, surface water (rivers, lakes), soil moisture and atmospheric water vapour. Key processes that transfer water among these stores are evaporation, condensation, precipitation, interception, infiltration, percolation, groundwater flow, evapotranspiration and runoff. At the scale of the drainage basin, the basin acts as an open system with precipitation as the principal input and river discharge and evapotranspiration as outputs. Stores within a basin include canopy interception, surface water, soil moisture and groundwater; flows include stemflow, overland flow, throughflow and baseflow.

Understanding the runoff hydrograph is essential. The hydrograph summarises how discharge at a gauging point responds over time to a precipitation event. Important features are the lag time between peak rainfall and peak discharge, the rising limb (how quickly discharge increases), the peak discharge value and the recession limb or falling limb. Land use (urbanisation, deforestation), soil moisture antecedent conditions, drainage density, slope, and the degree of impermeable surface determine the shape of the hydrograph. Urbanisation generally reduces lag time and increases peak discharge, increasing flood risk. The water balance equation provides a simple quantitative framework: precipitation = evapotranspiration + runoff ± change in storage. Converting between units (for example, millimetres over a catchment to cubic metres of water) is a practical skill for field and exam work.

## The carbon cycle: stores, fluxes and processes
The carbon cycle tracks carbon among atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. Major stores are the atmosphere (as CO2 and methane), terrestrial vegetation and soils, the oceans (dissolved inorganic carbon and organic matter), and long-term geological stores such as fossil fuels and carbonate rocks. At ecosystem scales, photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition and carbon sequestration control carbon fluxes. Photosynthesis moves carbon from the atmosphere into biomass; respiration and decomposition return it to the atmosphere; combustion (natural and human-caused) releases carbon rapidly; weathering and sedimentation transfer carbon to long-term geological stores.

Key concepts include net primary productivity (NPP), which is the balance between photosynthesis and plant respiration, and net ecosystem productivity (NEP), which subtracts heterotrophic respiration (decomposers) from NPP. Oceanic processes such as the solubility pump and biological pump sequester carbon in deep waters and sediments. Human activities have substantially altered the carbon cycle through the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels, large-scale deforestation, land-use change and intensive agriculture. These perturbations have increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, altered the carbon budget and are central to contemporary climate change.

## Interactions between water, carbon and climate
The water and carbon cycles are tightly linked and both influence and are influenced by climate. Atmospheric water vapour is an important greenhouse gas and changes in temperature influence evapotranspiration rates, soil moisture and the stability of cryospheric stores. Warming affects the carbon cycle through several feedbacks: increased temperatures can enhance plant growth in some regions (a negative feedback) but can also accelerate soil organic matter decomposition and release of CO2 and methane from thawing permafrost (a positive feedback). Changes in precipitation patterns can stress forests, leading to increased tree mortality and therefore reduced carbon sequestration capacity. Conversely, large-scale deforestation reduces transpiration and local rainfall recycling, altering regional water cycles. In the oceans, warming reduces solubility of CO2 and can harm biological productivity, weakening the ocean carbon sink. Understanding feedback loops — both amplifying and dampening — is central to predicting future climate trajectories and to answering synoptic exam questions that ask you to evaluate system responses.

## Human impacts, management and mitigation
Human interventions modify stores and flows in both cycles. Water management includes abstraction for domestic and agricultural use, transfer schemes and reservoirs that change the timing and magnitude of flows, and engineered flood defences that alter floodplain connectivity. Land use change such as urban expansion increases surface runoff and reduces infiltration; agricultural practices can change soil moisture and groundwater recharge. Management strategies include sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS), catchment restoration, demand management, and desalination, each with trade-offs for energy use, ecological impacts and long-term sustainability.

For carbon, mitigation strategies range from reducing fossil fuel emissions through energy efficiency and renewables to enhancing sequestration via reforestation, afforestation and soil carbon management. Technological options such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) are proposed at large scales but face economic and environmental constraints. Natural climate solutions, such as peatland restoration and protection of mature forests, provide co-benefits for biodiversity and the water cycle. Policy instruments — carbon pricing, emissions trading schemes and international agreements — aim to change incentives, but their effectiveness depends on governance, equity and enforcement.

## Practical skills, fieldwork and quantitative techniques
A-level students are expected to combine qualitative and quantitative approaches in fieldwork. For water cycle studies, field techniques include measuring channel cross-sections, velocity and discharge, soil moisture sampling, and precipitation measurement. You should be able to calculate discharge from cross-sectional area and mean velocity, convert rainfall depth over a catchment into volume, and construct and interpret hydrographs. For carbon cycle investigations, practical work might include biomass sampling, tree allometry calculations to estimate carbon stocks, soil sampling and laboratory analysis or the use of remote sensing to estimate vegetation cover and NPP. Quantitative skills include simple mass-balance calculations, unit conversions, descriptive statistics (mean, median, range), interpretation of scatterplots and Spearman’s rank for assessing relationships in non-parametric data. Qualitative methods are equally important: interviews, content analysis of management documents and participant observation can reveal perceptions and governance issues around water and carbon management. In the written investigation, justify your sampling strategy, acknowledge sources of error and bias, assess representativeness, and present data clearly with suitable graphs and maps.

## Case studies: tropical rainforest and a river catchment
The tropical rainforest offers a clear example of strong links between water and carbon. Intact rainforests store large quantities of carbon in biomass and soils while recycling moisture through high rates of evapotranspiration that contribute to regional rainfall. Deforestation in places such as the Amazon reduces biomass carbon stores and soil carbon through erosion and oxidation, and disrupts the local water cycle by lowering evapotranspiration and changing albedo, which can lead to lower regional precipitation and an amplification of drought risk. These processes illustrate how human land-use change can convert a carbon sink into a carbon source, with implications for global climate.

At catchment scale, consider a temperate river basin as a fieldwork context where land-use change and precipitation variability influence flood risk and water supply. Measuring how urban expansion increases impermeable surfaces and shortens lag time on hydrographs illustrates the direct hydrological consequences of human activity. A catchment investigation might measure changes in baseflow and peak discharge over seasonal cycles, link these to antecedent soil moisture and land management, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions such as upstream reforestation, wetland restoration or SUDS in reducing flood peaks and enhancing groundwater recharge. Using local examples strengthens exam answers and demonstrates an ability to link theory with concrete geographical evidence.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on the water and carbon cycles requires clear definitions, structured argument and deployment of appropriate case study detail. Begin by defining key terms and framing your answer within a systems perspective where relevant. For short-answer questions be precise and use correct process language (for example, name processes such as evapotranspiration, infiltration, photosynthesis, respiration). For mid-length (8–12 mark) questions combine description with explanation and include a short example; structure your response in paragraphs that each make one clear point and link evidence to the question. For extended response questions (18–25+ marks), plan a coherent essay that begins with a concise introduction setting out your argument, follows with several developed paragraphs that integrate theory, specific case study evidence and quantitative or qualitative data, and ends with a balanced conclusion that evaluates uncertainty or trade-offs. Use system terms such as stores, flows, feedbacks and equilibrium; refer to magnitudes where possible (for hydrograph features, carbon stock changes or rates); and explicitly address command words: “explain” requires causal chains, “evaluate” requires weighing strengths and weaknesses, and “assess” requires judgement. When using case studies, be specific about place, spatial scale and timescale, and show how the evidence supports your point. For NEA and fieldwork questions, justify methods, acknowledge limitations and explain how your findings relate to wider theory. Finally, integrate cross-topic links where appropriate (for example how water management decisions affect carbon fluxes) to show breadth and depth of understanding — this synoptic thinking scores highly at A-level.
