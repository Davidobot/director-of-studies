# Contemporary urban environments (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview and significance
Contemporary urban environments consider how cities form, grow and change; how their physical layouts and social structures develop; and how urban processes create both opportunities and problems for their inhabitants and for the wider environment. This topic asks you to think at a range of scales: from the local neighbourhood through the city-region to global networks of trade and finance. It links human geography concepts such as place, identity, scale and inequality with physical processes that influence urban climate and hydrology. A strong grasp of this section helps you explain real-world issues — from the rise of megacities in the Global South to regeneration programmes in the UK — and to evaluate strategies for making cities more socially equitable and environmentally sustainable.

## Urbanisation and urban change
Urbanisation describes the long-term increase in the proportion of people living in towns and cities. Since 1945 global patterns of urbanisation have shifted dramatically: rapid urban growth in parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America has produced many megacities (cities with more than 10 million people), while older industrial cities in Europe and North America have often experienced population loss or restructuring. Urban change is driven by economic, social, technological, political and demographic processes. Deindustrialisation explains the decline of manufacturing employment in many western cities from the late twentieth century onwards and the subsequent rise of the service economy. These structural economic changes produced patterns of job loss, population movement, and altered land use. Processes such as suburbanisation and counter‑urbanisation describe the relocation of people and activities outwards from city centres, while urban resurgence and re-urbanisation name the more recent return of investment, people and businesses to inner urban areas. Understanding these processes helps explain why cities show such diverse patterns of growth, decline and redevelopment.

## Urban forms and new urban landscapes
The physical form of a city reflects its history, topography, infrastructure and the distribution of economic activities. World cities and megacities have distinct characteristics: global financial and corporate headquarters, specialised service sectors, and complex transport and communication networks that integrate them into the global economy. In many western cities new urban landscapes have emerged as a response to change: town-centre mixed developments combine shopping, leisure and housing; cultural and heritage quarters exploit local identity for economic benefit; fortress developments increase security and separation; and edge cities or business parks concentrate employment on urban fringes, often accessible by car. Gentrification is an important facet of these changes, whereby inner-city neighbourhoods attract wealthier residents and investment, altering social composition and housing markets. To analyse urban form, you should consider both physical drivers (rivers, coasts, relief) and human drivers (planning policies, land values, infrastructure investment).

## Social and economic issues
Contemporary urban environments often concentrate economic opportunities alongside pronounced inequalities. Spatial patterns of land use and income create economic inequality, social segregation and cultural diversity across neighbourhoods. Poverty, unemployment and inadequate housing coexist in proximity to affluent districts and service-sector growth zones. Strategies to manage these issues range from housing policy and affordable housing provision to employment programmes, community initiatives and spatial planning tools. When you discuss social and economic issues in essays or case studies, it is important to show how structural forces (globalisation, policy decisions, labour market change) combine with local factors (access to transport, historical development) to produce particular outcomes for people and places. Always link social patterns to causes and consequences, and consider the distributional impacts of proposed policies.

## Urban climate and air quality
Cities modify local climate in measurable ways. The urban heat island effect describes higher temperatures in urban cores compared with surrounding rural areas, a consequence of heat‑retaining surfaces, reduced vegetation and anthropogenic heat from traffic and buildings. Urban design and materials influence wind patterns, the frequency and intensity of thunderstorms and conditions for fog. Air quality is a major urban environmental issue: particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and ozone contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular illness. Historical episodes like London’s mid‑twentieth-century smogs underline the human cost of poor urban air quality, and contemporary problems persist in many cities worldwide. Policies to reduce pollution include low-emission zones, congestion charging, promotion of public transport and investment in cleaner energy for buildings and industry. In exam answers, link the physical mechanisms (heat retention, reduced cooling by evapotranspiration) to human impacts and to practical mitigation measures.

## Urban drainage, rivers and waste management
Urbanisation changes the water cycle. More impervious surfaces lead to faster runoff, reduced infiltration and flashier hydrographs, which raises flood risk for urban catchments. Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) and blue‑green infrastructure (such as permeable paving, bioswales, green roofs and restored wetlands) are designed to moderate flows, increase infiltration and store water, while providing ecological and recreational benefits. River restoration projects, such as the daylighting of buried streams, can improve urban biodiversity, water quality and amenity; the Cheonggyecheon project in Seoul is a well-known example of removing elevated infrastructure to restore an urban river and create public space. Urban waste management is another critical challenge. Cities generate a range of wastes from households, industry and construction; choices between landfill, recycling and energy-from-waste (incineration with energy recovery) have social, economic and environmental trade-offs. When comparing options, consider local constraints, emissions, energy potential, land availability and public acceptance.

## Environmental problems and sustainable urban development
Urban areas generate a range of environmental problems: atmospheric and water pollution, dereliction of former industrial sites, and loss of green space. Tackling these challenges requires integrated approaches to sustainability that balance natural, social and economic dimensions. The concept of liveability captures how well a city supports quality of life through housing, transport, health, work and leisure. Strategies for more sustainable cities include compact land-use patterns, improving public transport, enhancing walking and cycling infrastructure, retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency, increasing urban green cover and promoting local circular economies that reduce, reuse and recycle materials. Examples from around the world show different pathways: Curitiba in Brazil established efficient bus rapid transit and integrated land use to shape sustainable growth; several European cities (for example Freiburg in Germany) have focused on renewable energy, energy-efficient housing and participatory planning. In essays and case studies, evaluate both strengths and limitations of sustainability strategies and consider social justice: who benefits, who bears costs, and how equity is addressed.

## Case studies and fieldwork links
Robust case studies are central to high-quality answers. You should be prepared with two contrasting urban case studies that illustrate patterns of economic and social well-being, and the environmental conditions that affect sustainability. One case study should be local or national (for UK students this could be a local city or neighbourhood) and the other should be contrasting, possibly a megacity in the Global South or a different model of urban governance. Use each case to show cause and effect, to evaluate policies, and to provide specific evidence — for example, figures on unemployment, air quality indices, or outcomes of regeneration schemes. Fieldwork is an excellent way to gather original data for the non-exam assessment and to enrich exam answers. Practical investigations might include transects measuring temperature or land use, surveys of residents about perceptions of change, river discharge measurements, or analysis of local waste streams. Link field data to wider theory and secondary sources so your conclusions are grounded in both empirical observation and conceptual understanding.

## Exam technique
In essay and structured questions on contemporary urban environments, aim to combine clear definitions, place-specific evidence and balanced evaluation. Begin by defining key terms and setting out the scale and context. Use one or two well-developed case studies to illustrate each point; facts and figures strengthen arguments but should be relevant and explained. When asked to “assess” or “evaluate,” present both strengths and weaknesses of policies or processes and reach a reasoned judgement that weighs evidence. Apply concepts such as globalisation, inequality, sustainability and resilience to structure analysis, and show links between processes (for example, how deindustrialisation can lead to dereliction, which may then become the focus for regeneration and gentrification). For paper questions that demand geographical skills, refer where appropriate to maps, graphs or field data and interpret them clearly. In longer answers, a coherent structure — introduction, analysis with case evidence, counterarguments and conclusion — keeps your response focused. Finally, use your fieldwork experience to add depth: even brief references to methods, data quality and local patterns demonstrate independent geographical thinking and meet assessment objectives for application and the use of evidence.
