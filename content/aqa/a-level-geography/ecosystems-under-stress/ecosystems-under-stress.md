# Ecosystems under stress (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: why ecosystems matter and why they are stressed
Ecosystems are the integrated communities of plants, animals, microorganisms and the physical environment in which they live. They range from a pond, a patch of heathland or a hedgerow in the British Isles through to vast biomes such as tropical rainforests, savannas and coral reefs. All ecosystems operate as systems: energy enters, is transferred between trophic levels, and leaves; materials such as nutrients cycle through stores and flows; and organisms respond to both gradual and sudden changes. Understanding these structures and processes is central to physical geography because ecosystems provide resources and services that underpin human life — from food, timber and fresh water to climate regulation and cultural value.

Many ecosystems are under stress today from a combination of human and natural drivers. Land-use change, deforestation, agricultural intensification, urban expansion, pollution, over-extraction of resources, invasive species and climate change all act alone or together to alter ecosystem structure and function. The result can be reduced biodiversity, declining productivity, weakened resilience and diminished ecosystem services. In this topic you will apply a systems approach to examine causes, pathways and consequences of change at a range of scales, and consider management strategies that aim for sustainability and resilience.

## Ecosystem structure, function and response
At the heart of ecosystem study are the ideas of structure and function. Structure describes the living communities and physical context — climate, soils, hydrology and topography — and functional elements include energy flows, nutrient cycling, productivity and the web of feeding relationships that link producers, consumers and decomposers. Net primary productivity (NPP) and biomass indicate how much energy is stored by plants and available to higher trophic levels; mineral nutrient cycles show how soil fertility supports this productivity.

Ecosystems are dynamic and respond to change through mechanisms such as succession, feedbacks and thresholds. Succession describes the directional change in community composition over time, from colonising species to more complex assemblages and, potentially, to a climatic climax. Human actions can arrest or redirect succession to create plagioclimax states — for example, heather moorland maintained by grazing or burning. Feedbacks can amplify or dampen change: for instance, deforestation reduces evapotranspiration and local rainfall, which can further reduce plant growth and reinforce forest loss. Thresholds and tipping points are important because gradual change can produce abrupt shifts in ecosystem state that are difficult to reverse.

When studying these processes, it helps to think in terms of inputs and outputs, stores and transfers. Inputs might include solar energy, precipitation and nutrient deposition; outputs may be respiration, runoff and erosion. Management aims to intervene in these pathways to either protect or restore ecosystem integrity, and strategies range from protected areas and restoration ecology to payments for ecosystem services and sustainable land-use practices.

## Biomes in contrast: tropical rainforest and savanna grassland
Two terrestrial biomes that illustrate contrasting ecosystem function and human pressures are tropical rainforests and savanna grasslands. Tropical rainforests are characterised by high rainfall, warm temperatures, dense multi-layered vegetation and very high biodiversity and productivity. Most of the biomass is held in large trees and associated epiphytes, and rapid nutrient cycling in the thin soils supports luxuriant growth. Rainforests play a crucial role in the global carbon and hydrological cycles; they capture and store carbon, support local and regional rainfall through evapotranspiration, and host a large share of the planet’s species.

Savanna grasslands, found across parts of Africa, South America and Australia, combine grass-dominated ground layers with scattered trees and a pronounced seasonal climate with distinct wet and dry periods. Productivity is lower than in rainforests but large herbivores and their predators, fire regimes and human pastoralism shape these landscapes. Savannas are adapted to regular fire and grazing, and their nutrient cycles operate at different rates compared with rainforests.

Human activity affects both biomes but in different ways. Tropical rainforests face deforestation for agriculture and commodity production such as cattle ranching and oil palm plantations, selective logging, road building and mining. These activities fragment habitat, reduce biodiversity and release stored carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Savannas are affected by conversion to cropland, changes in fire regimes, overgrazing and the breakdown of traditional pastoralist systems. In both biomes the outcomes hinge on scale, intensity and governance: local livelihood needs may conflict with global conservation goals, and any assessment must weigh social as well as ecological consequences.

## Marine ecosystems and coral reefs
Marine ecosystems, and coral reefs in particular, illustrate how physical conditions and human actions combine to threaten biodiversity. Coral reefs develop where water is warm, clear and nutrient-poor enough to support symbiotic relationships between corals and photosynthetic zooxanthellae. Reefs are biodiversity hotspots, protect coastlines by buffering wave energy and support fisheries and tourism vital to many coastal communities.

Stresses on coral reefs include rising sea temperatures that cause coral bleaching, ocean acidification that weakens coral skeletons, overfishing that alters food webs, sedimentation and nutrient runoff from agriculture that promotes algal overgrowth, and direct physical damage from coastal development and careless tourism. Episodes of coral bleaching, such as those recorded on the Great Barrier Reef, show how warming events can cause widespread mortality and reduce reef structure and function. Management responses include marine protected areas, improved watershed management to reduce runoff, fisheries regulation, coral gardening and restoration, and global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Evaluating these measures requires thinking across scales: local protection cannot secure reefs if ocean warming continues to rise.

## Ecosystems in the British Isles: succession, climax and management
Ecosystems in the British Isles offer accessible examples of succession, plagioclimax and human influence. The temperate deciduous woodland represents the climatic climax for much of lowland Britain, with broadleaved trees, a rich understory and well-developed soils. Succesional sequences such as lithoseres (from bare rock to woodland) and hydroseres (from open water to swamp to woodland) illustrate natural trajectories of change. Human activities have long shaped the landscape: clearance for agriculture, the creation of hedgerows, drainage of wetlands and the management of uplands for grazing or grouse moors have all produced mosaics of semi-natural habitats.

Plagioclimax examples include heather moorland where burning and grazing maintain an open, heather-dominated habitat valued for certain species and for recreation, but which may reduce tree regeneration and soil carbon storage. Coastal dune systems and ponds are other local ecosystems that can be used for fieldwork: dunes show zonation from fore-dune pioneer plants to fixed dune vegetation, while ponds demonstrate nutrient dynamics, succession and habitat management. Conservation strategies in the UK often combine habitat protection, active management (such as controlled grazing or burning), species reintroductions and community engagement. These interventions demonstrate that conservation is rarely a simple reversion to a “natural” state but rather a negotiated balance between ecological goals and human uses.

## Monitoring, measuring and managing change: methods and responses
A robust understanding of ecosystems under stress relies on both qualitative and quantitative methods. Fieldwork techniques such as quadrat sampling, transects, species frequency and percentage cover measurements, soil sampling for pH and moisture, biomass harvesting (where permitted) and remote sensing for canopy cover and land-use change are central. Analysis may employ descriptive statistics and measures of diversity, and inferential techniques such as Spearman’s rank correlation or chi-square tests to test hypotheses. Geospatial technologies, including GIS, allow mapping of habitat extent, fragmentation and connectivity over time.

Management responses range from protected areas and restoration projects to policies that address underlying drivers. In tropical forests, approaches include reduced-impact logging, community forestry, agroforestry and mechanisms such as REDD+ that aim to value and reward carbon storage. In savannas and rangelands, adaptive grazing, fire regime management and pastoral rights can sustain both livelihoods and biodiversity. For marine systems, marine protected areas, sustainable fisheries management, pollution controls and restoration projects have been used with varying success. Effective management recognises the need for multi-level governance, community participation, long-term monitoring and adaptive management that responds to new information and changing conditions.

## Case studies: integrating evidence and judgement
Case studies are central to exam answers and to fieldwork investigations. They should be chosen to illustrate key processes, impacts and responses at appropriate scales and to allow critical evaluation. Useful examples include tropical rainforest loss in the Amazon and Borneo driven by agriculture and logging, the contrasting governance and conservation outcomes across different nations, and the cascading effects on carbon storage and regional climates. In savanna settings consider the Serengeti and Sahelian systems where pastoralism, agricultural expansion and drought interact. For marine examples, the Great Barrier Reef and Caribbean reefs provide contrasting histories of protection, tourism pressure and bleaching events.

In the UK, local case studies such as the restoration of fenland or rewilding projects, the management of coastal dunes at Studland or the conservation of heathland provide accessible contexts for field investigations. Effective case studies combine description of the physical and human context, evidence of change (quantitative where possible), explanation of processes and a balanced evaluation of management and future prospects. Always link local detail to wider concepts: how does a local restoration project relate to regional biodiversity targets or to global carbon budgets?

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on ecosystems under stress, use a systems approach in your planning: set out the key stores and flows, identify drivers of change and explain feedbacks and thresholds. Begin extended answers with a concise definition of key terms, then outline the physical and human context before developing your argument. Integrate named case studies to demonstrate depth of knowledge; use them to exemplify processes, impacts and management responses rather than as isolated narratives. Where relevant, include quantitative evidence—measures of biomass, changes in area, or observed trends—and consider the reliability and limitations of data.

For evaluations, balance positive and negative outcomes, consider alternative futures and reflect on scale: local management may be effective yet insufficient without regional or global action. Use diagrams where they help to clarify systems, flows or successional sequences, and annotate them to add value. In shorter questions be precise and focused; in longer prose questions ensure your writing is structured with an introduction, developed paragraphs and a brief conclusion that answers the question directly.

For fieldwork-based non-exam assessments, choose focused, feasible research questions and justify your methods clearly. Explain sampling strategies and ethical considerations, and use appropriate statistical tests (for example, Spearman’s rank for associations) to support your analysis. Be explicit about limitations and show how results relate to wider geographical theory and context. Keep raw data in appendices and ensure your main text stays within the advised word count while demonstrating AO1, AO2 and AO3 skills: knowledge, application and fieldwork competence. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions, refine your use of case study evidence and learn to apply concepts such as resilience, sustainability and feedbacks consistently across different ecosystems. This approach will help you demonstrate the depth and breadth of understanding the A-level specification expects.
