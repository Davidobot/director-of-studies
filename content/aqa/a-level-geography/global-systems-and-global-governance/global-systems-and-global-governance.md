# Global systems and global governance (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: what this topic covers
Global systems and global governance is about how the modern world is linked together and how those links are managed, regulated and contested. At its heart are the processes of globalisation: the flows of capital, people, goods, services and information that connect places from local neighbourhoods to international regions. Closely linked to these flows are the institutions, laws and norms that try to govern shared resources and global problems. Studying this topic asks you to explain how and why global connections form, who benefits from them, who loses out, and how attempts at global governance work in practice. You will be expected to use case studies and data to show how these abstract ideas play out in real places and to use both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate and explain patterns and impacts.

## Globalisation: flows and drivers
Globalisation can be described as the intensification of worldwide social, economic and political interconnections. These connections take many forms: capital moves through foreign direct investment and portfolio flows; goods and food move along increasingly complex supply chains; people cross borders as migrants, students and temporary workers; services are traded digitally across time zones; and information circulates instantly via the internet and global media. The main drivers of these flows are improvements in transport and communications, liberalised trade and financial systems, advances in information technology, and policy decisions such as trade agreements and deregulation. Technological change reduces costs and time, making it feasible for companies to locate different stages of production in different countries. Political decisions – for instance to allow freer movement of capital or to join a trading bloc – reshape opportunities and constraints. Understanding the drivers is key to explaining why some places become highly connected while others remain peripheral.

## Global systems, interdependence and power
Global systems create interdependence: what happens in one place can have significant effects elsewhere. This can be stabilising, for example when investment in a low-income country creates jobs and infrastructure, but it can also create vulnerability, for example when financial shocks or pandemics spread quickly across borders. Crucially, the flows within global systems are not equal. Power asymmetries mean that wealthier states, major corporations and influential international institutions can shape rules and patterns to their advantage, while less powerful states have more limited ability to control outcomes. These inequalities are visible in who controls capital and technology, who sets trade rules, and who can influence the enforcement of international norms. Recognising these unequal power relations helps explain why globalisation produces both growth and widening inequalities, why conflicts over resources occur, and why some attempts at global governance are resisted or fail to reach consensus.

## International trade, transnational corporations and access to markets
International trade is a major element of global systems. Patterns of trade have changed dramatically in recent decades, with emerging economies like China and India becoming major exporters and hubs for manufacturing and services. Access to markets depends on many factors including trade agreements, tariffs, transport costs and the comparative advantage of each country. Transnational corporations (TNCs) are central actors in this process. A specified TNC, such as a multinational electronics firm, will typically design products in a high-income country, source components from several middle-income countries, assemble products in factories in another region, and sell worldwide through global marketing networks. This spatial organisation brings employment and investment to some regions but can also create low-wage, insecure jobs, environmental damage and an uneven distribution of profits. Trade in a food commodity such as coffee or a manufactured product such as smartphones illustrates how value is added at different points in the chain, and how market access influences local livelihoods. When analysing trade, it is important to look beyond simple export figures to patterns of control, ownership and value capture.

## Global governance: institutions, laws and norms
Global governance refers to the formal and informal rules, institutions and procedures that regulate global issues. It includes intergovernmental organisations, treaty systems, international law, and networks of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and businesses. Institutions such as the United Nations and its specialised agencies, multilateral development banks, the World Trade Organization and regional bodies seek to coordinate action, set standards and provide forums for negotiation. Governance can promote cooperation, for example by enabling disaster relief, coordinating disease surveillance or setting environmental standards. However, the effectiveness of governance depends on member states’ willingness to comply, the design of enforcement mechanisms, and the capacity of institutions to respond to change. Global governance is therefore contested: some actors push for stronger international rules, others resist perceived loss of sovereignty, and NGOs often play watchdog or advocacy roles to hold powerful actors to account.

## The global commons and Antarctica as a case study
The global commons are those parts of the planet beyond national jurisdiction that everyone relies on and that require collective management: the atmosphere, high seas, polar regions, and outer space are typical examples. Managing these commons raises questions about rights, responsibilities and sustainability. Antarctica is a powerful case study because it is governed through a specific international regime designed to preserve the continent for science and peaceful uses. The Antarctic Treaty of 1959 set aside territorial claims and prohibited military activity. Subsequent agreements, including the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1991), placed a moratorium on mineral exploitation and established environmental protection measures. The International Whaling Commission’s 1982 moratorium on commercial whaling illustrates how international norms can be created to protect a global resource, albeit with limits and loopholes. Despite these governance structures, Antarctica faces threats from climate change, fishing, tourism and potential resource interest. NGOs and scientific communities play an important role in monitoring and campaigning for strict protection, highlighting how governance depends on a mix of legal instruments, scientific evidence and public pressure.

## Critical perspectives: benefits, inequalities and environmental costs
A critical examination of globalisation and global governance recognises both benefits and costs. Benefits include economic growth, technology transfer, increased consumer choice and international cooperation on shared problems. Yet the same processes can deepen inequalities within and between countries, erode local control, and intensify environmental degradation. Debates about globalisation feature different perspectives: some argue that open markets and technological progress will lift all boats; others, following Malthusian or neo-Malthusian lines, warn of resource limits and environmental thresholds; and alternative thinkers point to the potential for local innovation, resilience and governance reforms to produce fairer outcomes. In practice, responses to global problems often combine mitigation and adaptation measures, regulatory frameworks, and civil society activism. When you evaluate cases, balance an account of economic gains with discussion of social justice, environmental sustainability and the uneven power relations that shape who decides and who benefits.

## Methods, data and fieldwork for studying global systems
Although the topics are global, the skills you develop are practical and local. Understanding global systems demands both quantitative and qualitative techniques. Quantitative skills include interpreting trade statistics, foreign direct investment flows, maps of commodity chains, and geospatial data visualisations. Qualitative approaches involve analysing policy documents, company reports, media representations and interviews with stakeholders. Fieldwork might examine local manifestations of global processes: for example, tracking how an imported product reaches a local shop, interviewing workers about employment conditions in a factory linked to a global supply chain, or using GIS to map the local environmental impacts of a major infrastructure project. Case studies should combine numerical evidence with lived experience to explain how global forces shape specific places. When choosing case studies, pick one clear example to describe in depth and a contrasting example to show variation in outcomes and governance responses.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on global systems and global governance, aim to show a clear balance between knowledge, application and analysis. For short-answer questions focus on precise definitions and brief examples. For mid-length questions develop explanation with one well-explained case study or data interpretation. For extended prose questions plan a structured response that starts with a concise introduction setting out your argument, then proceeds with paragraphs that each present a point, supported by evidence, analysis and a real-world example, and ends with a balanced conclusion that returns to the question. Always apply geographical concepts such as interdependence, scale, inequality, systems and feedbacks. Use named case studies (for example a specified TNC and the coffee or smartphone trade, and Antarctica as a governance example) and integrate data where provided: describe key patterns, interpret causes, and evaluate impacts. When critiquing governance, explain what institutions have achieved, then show limitations and alternative perspectives. For questions that require evaluation, explicitly weigh up costs and benefits and consider short-term versus long-term outcomes. In fieldwork-related tasks demonstrate awareness of methods and data quality by explaining sampling choices, sources of error and the representativeness of findings. Finally, link local evidence to global processes: show how local cases illustrate broader patterns of globalisation and governance to meet the assessment objectives and to produce answers that are both place-specific and conceptually strong.
