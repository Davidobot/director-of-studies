# Resource security: water, energy and minerals (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction and why resource security matters
Resource security is about ensuring reliable, affordable and sustainable access to the natural inputs societies need to survive and prosper: water to drink and grow food, energy to power homes and industry, and minerals to build infrastructure and modern technology. At A-level this theme asks you to link physical geography (where resources occur, how they are stored and cycled) with human geography (demand, trade, governance and conflict). The topic examines global patterns and local realities, the drivers of change, the environmental and social impacts of extraction and supply, and the strategies used to manage scarcity and avoid or resolve conflicts. Understanding resource security means thinking about supply and demand, the technologies that change both, the institutions that govern access, and the trade-offs required to achieve sustainability.

## Key concepts and classifications
Before exploring particular resources it is vital to be clear about definitions. A resource is anything that people value and can use. Stock resources are accumulations—such as a deposit of copper ore—while flow resources are processes that provide benefits over time, such as renewable river flows or solar radiation. Reserve classifications used in the industry (measured, indicated, inferred) describe degrees of geological confidence and economic feasibility. The idea of a resource frontier captures how exploration, technology and price can turn previously marginal deposits into exploitable reserves. Conversely, the notion of a resource peak (for example, “peak oil”) refers to the point at which production from a resource begins a long-term decline. Assessment tools such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and concepts like carrying capacity, virtual water and ecological footprint help evaluate the sustainability and wider effects of resource development.

Quantitatively, resource security is assessed by comparing availability and demand. Water stress indices, per capita annual water availability, energy mix percentages and proven reserve-to-production ratios for minerals are typical indicators. Qualitatively, governance, institutional capacity and conflict potential shape whether available resources translate into secure supplies for people and economies. Geopolitics matters because many resources cross borders, are concentrated in a few countries, or move through strategic chokepoints and global supply chains.

## Water security: sources, stress and management
Water security covers the availability, quality and access to freshwater for domestic use, agriculture, industry and ecosystems. Sources include surface water (rivers and lakes), groundwater (aquifers), and increasingly desalinated seawater and treated wastewater. Physical controls such as climate, geology and drainage patterns determine natural availability, but human factors—urban growth, agricultural intensification, land-use change and pollution—drive demand and reduce reliability.

Regions like the Middle East and North Africa suffer chronic water stress because low renewable freshwater per capita coincides with high demand. Other examples of pressure include groundwater depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer in the central United States and the overdrawing of aquifers in parts of India and China, which threaten long-term agricultural productivity. Major engineering responses have included large dams, inter-basin transfers and desalination. The South–North Water Transfer Project in China and the Three Gorges Dam show how states may undertake huge projects to redistribute water. Such schemes can increase supply but often have social and ecological costs: displacement of people, loss of biodiversity, sediment trapping and changes to downstream river systems.

Transboundary water politics is another critical dimension. The building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile has become a focal point for discussion about equitable sharing between upstream and downstream states—Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt—illustrating how upstream storage and hydropower can be perceived as a threat to downstream water security. At smaller scales, virtual water trade—importing water-intensive commodities like cereals—offers a way to conserve domestic water but can increase dependence on international markets.

Managing water security involves both supply-side and demand-side measures. Supply-side options include reservoirs, groundwater recharge and desalination; demand-side measures include efficient irrigation, leak reduction, metering, pricing and behavioural change. Integrated water resource management (IWRM) aims to balance these approaches across sectors and scales, while modern data tools (remote sensing, smart metering, GIS) improve monitoring and planning.

## Energy security: supply mixes, geopolitics and transition
Energy security means having dependable access to fuels and electricity at affordable prices while steering toward environmental targets. Primary energy sources include fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), nuclear power and renewables (hydropower, wind, solar, biomass). Secondary energy forms, such as electricity and refined petroleum products, require infrastructure that creates new vulnerabilities.

The global picture is one of uneven resource distribution. Oil and gas reserves are concentrated in certain regions, making supply networks sensitive to political events and transport bottlenecks at chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz. The recent history of Russian gas supply to Europe, and disputes linked to pipelines and transit states, exemplifies how energy dependence can translate into geopolitical leverage. Transnational corporations and national oil companies play a major role in exploration, production and global trade, shaping investment patterns and national development.

Environmental and social impacts of energy production vary by type. Conventional oil and gas development can cause habitat fragmentation, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Coal mining and combustion have historically produced severe local air pollution and health impacts as well as large CO2 emissions. Nuclear power offers low-carbon electricity but raises questions about radioactive waste, safety and high initial capital costs. Renewables reduce greenhouse gas emissions but require land, materials and grid adaptation; for example, large-scale hydropower can displace populations and alter river ecosystems, while wind and solar deployments need storage or balancing systems to manage intermittency.

Security strategies combine short-term reliability measures and long-term transition planning. Maintaining strategic petroleum reserves, diversifying supply routes and suppliers, improving energy efficiency, and investing in smart grids and storage technologies are all part of resilience. The energy transition toward low-carbon systems emphasises renewables, electrification of transport, energy storage and possibly hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, this transition increases demand for critical minerals used in batteries and wind turbines, linking energy security to mineral security.

## Mineral security: critical ores, impacts and supply chains
Mineral security is concerned with the availability, affordability and environmental acceptability of mined materials. Some ores, such as iron ore, copper and bauxite, are widespread and used in bulk industries; others, like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements, are relatively scarce yet essential for modern technologies including batteries, electronics and renewables. The global distribution of these materials is highly uneven, with countries such as Chile and Peru dominant in copper production, Australia and Brazil major in iron ore, and the Democratic Republic of Congo important for cobalt.

Extractive processes create significant environmental impacts: open-pit and strip mining scar landscapes, tailings dams can fail with catastrophic consequences, and acid mine drainage affects water quality long after closure. The Brumadinho tailings dam collapse in Brazil is an extreme example of the social and environmental harm that can follow inadequate regulation and oversight. Mining also has social costs including displacement, labour issues and conflict, especially where governance is weak.

The geopolitics of minerals is shaped by concentration of supply, market control, and processing capacity. China’s dominant role in rare earth mining and processing illustrates how control of refining and manufacturing can be as important as raw material reserves. Recycling and urban mining—recovering metals from electronic waste—are parts of a circular economy approach that can reduce primary extraction and exposure to external supply shocks. Responsible sourcing, corporate due diligence and international standards are increasingly demanded by consumers and regulators.

Sustainability in mineral cycles requires careful resource planning, rehabilitation of mined landscapes, reduction in material intensity through design and reuse, and diversification of supply. Strategic stockpiles, trade agreements and investment in alternative technologies or substitutes can also reduce vulnerability to supply disruptions.

## Management, trade-offs and future pathways
Managing resource security requires balancing competing objectives: meeting human needs, supporting economic development, protecting ecosystems and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This balancing act often forces difficult trade-offs. For example, a large hydropower dam can provide clean electricity and regional development but may flood ecosystems and displace communities. Deploying large-scale renewable energy reduces carbon emissions but increases demand for critical minerals and land. Policy choices therefore matter: regulations, pricing structures, investment incentives and international cooperation can shift the balance toward more equitable and sustainable outcomes.

Technological innovation plays a double role. It can open new frontiers—desalination and water recycling can expand water supply; fracking changed the global gas map; battery improvements increase electric vehicle viability—but it also creates new dependencies. Social and institutional responses are equally crucial. Transparent governance, community engagement, conflict resolution mechanisms for transboundary resources and benefit-sharing arrangements can reduce tensions and improve outcomes.

Scenario thinking is useful for resource futures. Low-emission pathways involve rapid decarbonisation, increased electrification and material efficiency, which will change demand for some minerals and reduce fossil fuel dependency. High-consumption growth scenarios without strong environmental management will intensify pressure on water, energy and mineral systems and increase the likelihood of conflict and ecological collapse. Policymakers, businesses and communities must therefore plan for multiple plausible futures and invest in resilience: storage and buffers, diversified supplies, recycling and demand management.

## Case study approaches for revision
When preparing case studies, choose examples that allow you to illustrate the links between physical conditions, human demand, governance and impacts. For water, a transboundary example such as the Nile/GERD dispute shows upstream–downstream tensions, while a domestic example like the Ogallala Aquifer demonstrates groundwater depletion and agricultural dependence. For energy, contrast a fossil-fuel dependent supplier-importer relationship such as Russia–Europe with a national energy transition example like Germany’s Energiewende or the rapid growth of wind and solar in the UK. For minerals, compare Chilean copper extraction with cobalt mining in the DRC to discuss geology, corporate and state roles, environmental and social impacts, and global supply chains. In each case, include data on production, reserves, trade flows and environmental metrics, explain the stakeholders involved, and evaluate management responses and their effectiveness.

## Exam technique
In exams, apply knowledge directly to the question using place-specific evidence and clear geographical concepts. Begin extended answers with a focused introduction that defines key terms and outlines the argument. Use case study detail to support points and show depth: name locations, quote relevant figures (for example reserve sizes, percentage of global production, or per capita water availability), and explain processes (hydrological, tectonic, economic). When asked to “assess” or “evaluate,” balance benefits and costs and conclude with a judgement that refers back to the question. For synoptic essays link resource security to broader themes such as globalisation, climate change and development trajectories. Show AO3 skills by interpreting simple data, commenting on representativeness and uncertainty, and where appropriate suggesting alternative data or methods. Practice writing concise, well-structured paragraphs that begin with a point, develop it with explanation or evidence, and end with a mini-conclusion. Finally, use diagrams where helpful: supply–demand curves, flow diagrams of water transfers, or annotated maps can add clarity and gain credit, but always explain them in the text.
