# Coastal systems and landscapes (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Coastal zones as natural systems
Coasts are best studied as open, dynamic systems where energy and sediment are exchanged between the land, sea and atmosphere. A systems approach helps you identify inputs of energy (wind, waves, tides), inputs and outputs of sediment, stores such as beaches, dunes and offshore bars, flows such as longshore drift and tidal currents, and feedbacks that maintain or change equilibrium. Coasts are not uniform: some are high-energy, dominated by strong waves and rapid erosion, while others are low-energy and dominated by deposition. Dynamic equilibrium describes a coast that adjusts to changes without dramatic long-term change, whereas positive and negative feedbacks can accelerate erosion or stabilise a shoreline. Human activity — from coastal defences to land use change in hinterlands — can alter sediment budgets and energy regimes, creating new feedbacks and sometimes producing unanticipated consequences downstream in the cell.

## Waves, tides, currents and sediment budgets
Waves are generated by wind across a fetch; their height, wavelength and period determine whether they erode or build beaches. Constructive waves are low, long, and deposit material; destructive waves are steep, powerful, and remove sediment. Tides and tidal range influence the extent of intertidal zones and the patterns of current flow, while storm surges superimposed on high tides can cause severe coastal flooding. Longshore drift (littoral drift) transports sediment along the shore when oblique waves move material up the beach on the swash and back down with the backwash; where flows converge or lose energy, deposition occurs. The concept of a sediment cell frames the coast as a series of linked compartments where sediment is sourced, transported and stored. Sediment budgets record inputs (cliff erosion, river supply, offshore deposition) and outputs (offshore loss, dredging); a deficit leads to beach narrowing and increased erosion, while a surplus promotes accretion. Human activities such as dam construction, beach nourishment, and groyne or harbour building can alter these budgets and redistribute impacts around the cell.

## Weathering, mass movement and marine erosion
Coastal change results from both sub-aerial and marine processes. Sub-aerial weathering includes mechanical action such as freeze–thaw and thermal expansion, chemical weathering such as solution and oxidation, and biological weathering by plants and organisms. Mass movement on cliff faces — rockfall, rotational slumping, and landslides — transfers material from cliffs to the shore where waves can then redistribute it. Marine erosion takes a number of forms: hydraulic action forces water into cracks, compressing air and exerting pressure; wave quarrying and impact dislodge blocks; abrasion (corrasion) grinds rock with transported sediment; attrition reduces clasts to smaller, rounder particles; and solution dissolves soluble rock. These processes form and modify cliff profiles, influence rates of retreat, and create sediment that feeds depositional landforms. Rates of cliff recession vary widely, depending on rock type, structure, the presence of joints and bedding planes, and human intervention.

## Erosional and depositional landforms
Characteristic erosional landforms include cliffs and wave-cut platforms, where repeated wave attack undercuts cliffs and leaves a gently sloping platform at low tide. Caves form in zones of weakness; continued erosion can create arches and, eventually, isolated stacks and stumps as roofs collapse. Depositional landforms are equally important and varied. Beaches form from sand and shingle where wave energy allows accumulation; their profiles change seasonally and after storms. Spits develop where longshore drift deposits material across a bay or estuary mouth; over time spits can recurved ends as wave direction changes. Tombolos connect an island to the mainland when sediment deposition occurs in the sheltered lee of the island, while offshore bars and barrier beaches form where sediment is heaped across shallow areas. Sand dune systems evolve behind beaches through the trapping of wind-blown sand and develop distinct vegetation succession. Estuarine environments, including mudflats and saltmarshes, are depositional features of sheltered, low-energy settings where fine sediment settles out and vegetation stabilises sediment, creating important carbon stores and habitats.

## Sea-level change and coastal types
Understanding sea-level change is central to coastal geography. Eustatic sea-level change involves global changes in sea level due to variations in the volume of water in the oceans or changes in ocean basin capacity, commonly associated with glacial–interglacial cycles. Isostatic change refers to vertical movement of land, such as post-glacial rebound following ice melt. Tectonic uplift or subsidence produces long-term relative sea-level changes locally. These different movements create emergent and submergent coastlines. Emergent features such as raised beaches and marine terraces show where land has risen relative to sea level, while rias, fjords and Dalmatian coastlines are products of submergence, where river valleys or glacial troughs have been flooded. Recent and projected climate change, with polar ice melt and thermal expansion, drives contemporary eustatic rise and increases the frequency and intensity of coastal hazards. The interplay between rates of sea-level rise, sediment supply and human defences often determines whether a coastline retreats, stabilises or requires managed realignment.

## Coastal management: hard, soft and sustainable approaches
Human responses to coastal flood and erosion risk range from hard engineering to soft and ecosystem-based strategies. Traditional hard engineering — seawalls, revetments, groynes, rock armour and breakwaters — aims to prevent erosion or protect assets, often delivering immediate local benefits but sometimes causing increased erosion downdrift through sediment starvation. Soft engineering includes beach nourishment, dune stabilisation and managed realignment; these approaches work with natural processes and can be more sustainable in the long term. Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) provide frameworks for decision-making that attempt to balance environmental, social and economic objectives at the scale of sediment cells or strategic coastal units. Case studies help to illustrate trade-offs: the Holderness coast in east Yorkshire demonstrates rapid cliff erosion on a retreating soft coastline with high sediment export, while the Medmerry managed realignment scheme in West Sussex shows how planned breaching of defences can restore intertidal habitats and reduce maintenance costs. On an international scale, low-lying nations such as the Maldives and Bangladesh highlight the complexities of adaptation where sea-level rise threatens large populations and where options are constrained by cost and land availability.

## Fieldwork, data skills and case study practice
Fieldwork is central to coastal study because it allows direct measurement of processes and testing of theory in situ. Common field techniques include beach profiling to measure cross-sectional change, sediment sampling and grain-size analysis to infer transport and provenance, cliff recession monitoring using fixed markers and GPS, wave counts and photographic transects to record morphological change. Geospatial tools such as GIS and unmanned aerial systems enhance analysis through mapping of shoreline change, sediment sources and land-use interactions. Quantitative skills required include calculating beach gradients, deriving sediment size distributions and measures of central tendency, and estimating sediment budgets. Qualitative skills are important too: semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders can reveal perceptions of risk and the social consequences of management decisions, and documentary analysis can place local change in longer-term political and economic contexts. Effective case studies combine a firm grasp of physical processes with evidence of human impacts and management, and they should include local and contrasting international examples. When preparing teaching lessons or revision materials, ensure students can link field measurements to broader coastal theory and can critique both hard and soft responses in terms of sustainability, cost and social equity.

## Exam technique
Exam answers should show a clear line of reasoning, use appropriate geographical terminology and refer to specific examples that illustrate points. For short-answer questions, be precise: define key terms and give succinct evidence. For explanation questions, structure responses so that each paragraph makes a single point, explains the process or mechanism, and links to an example where possible. For extended prose and essay-style questions, start with a concise introduction that outlines your understanding and the approach you will take, develop a balanced argument that uses theory, data and case study evidence, and end with a conclusion that directly answers the question and reflects on uncertainties or implications. Use annotated sketches and labelled diagrams to support descriptions of processes and landforms, and make sure any fieldwork evidence used is clearly integrated into argument rather than simply dropped in. When evaluating management options, compare costs, benefits and environmental consequences and consider scale and timescale; conclude by judging which approach best suits the context and why. Time management is essential in exams: plan answers briefly for longer questions, allocate time by mark value and reserve a few minutes to check that your conclusion answers the precise question asked.
