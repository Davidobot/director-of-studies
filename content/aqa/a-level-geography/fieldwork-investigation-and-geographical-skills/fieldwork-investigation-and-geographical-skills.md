# Fieldwork investigation and geographical skills (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: why fieldwork matters in A-level Geography
Fieldwork is not an optional extra; it is central to A-level Geography and to how geographers think and work. The non-exam assessment (NEA) for AQA requires an individual investigation that draws on field data and demonstrates the practical application of geographical concepts, methods and skills. Fieldwork gives you the opportunity to see processes at work, to collect your own evidence, and to test theory against reality. Beyond the NEA, the course expects you to develop a balance of quantitative and qualitative skills, competence with maps and GIS, and the critical disposition to question sources and methods. For assessment purposes, the fieldwork investigation is 3,000–4,000 words long, is worth 60 marks, and contributes 20% of the A-level grade, so planning, execution and write-up all matter.

## Fieldwork requirements and practical planning
Every student must take part in at least four days of fieldwork during the A-level course, and these days should cover both physical and human geography processes where possible. Fieldwork can be arranged locally, within a city or neighbourhood, or further afield and can be completed as full days or a series of shorter sessions. Schools and colleges must confirm that their students have had the opportunity to complete four days of fieldwork; this administrative statement is normally provided to the board in the year of entry and is part of centre responsibilities. When planning fieldwork think carefully about logistics and safety, suitable timing for the phenomena you wish to study, access permissions and equipment. Weather, tides, school timetables and the availability of specialist sites will all affect what is feasible, so build contingency plans and ensure that data collection remains practical and ethical.

## Formulating an independent investigation and understanding independence
A strong NEA begins with a focused research question that you define and develop yourself. The investigation must have a clear locational and theoretical context and should stem from preliminary research into relevant literature, maps and datasets. Independence is explicitly required for several stages: defining and developing the research question, sourcing and drawing on your own research and data, contextualising and analysing findings, and presenting conclusions. Practical data collection may be conducted collaboratively, but analysis, interpretation and write-up must be your own. Teachers can give broad parameters, advice on health and safety and general feedback on viability, but they must not provide lists of ready-made titles, model answers, or step-by-step corrections that would remove your ability to show independent judgement. All independent work must be authenticated with a Candidate Record Form (CRF) signed by you and by the teacher; this form documents the proposal, any additional assistance and confirms the work’s authenticity.

## Field methods, sampling and ethical considerations
Choosing appropriate methods is the heart of good fieldwork. Methods should be justified in relation to your question and should be practical in the chosen location. For physical geography this might include standardised surveys of discharge, channel cross-sections, pebble size analysis, soil moisture or transects of beach profiles. For human geography this might include structured questionnaires, pedestrian counts, land-use mapping, observational schedules, interviews and photographic inventories. Mixed methods often provide the best evidence, for example pairing quantitative traffic counts with qualitative interviews about travel choices.

Sampling strategy is central to the reliability and representativeness of your results. Random sampling reduces bias, systematic sampling suits ordered spatial studies such as transects, and stratified sampling helps when a site contains distinct sub-areas. Be realistic about sample size: more samples increase confidence but require more time and quality control. Record precisely how and when data were collected, including timing relative to tides, rush hours, or seasonal factors, because temporal context affects interpretation. Ethical considerations must also be addressed. Where people are involved you should obtain informed consent, avoid intrusive questioning, anonymise personal data, and reflect on the social and political implications of your research. If fieldwork involves sensitive locations or vulnerable groups, consult your teacher about permissions and safeguarding procedures before you go.

## Data handling, GIS and statistical analysis
Good fieldwork is only as useful as the analysis that follows. Your investigation should demonstrate knowledge of techniques for analysing both quantitative and qualitative data. For quantitative datasets you will typically present descriptive statistics such as mean, median and mode and measures of dispersion like range, inter-quartile range and standard deviation. Graphical representations should be chosen to match the data and the argument: scatterplots and best-fit lines for relationships, line graphs for temporal change, bar charts for categorical comparisons, and proportional circles or choropleth maps for spatial patterns. Where appropriate, use inferential or relational statistics to test hypotheses; common techniques at A-level include Spearman’s rank correlation for non-parametric relationships and Chi-square tests for categorical associations. Always explain what a statistical test shows and whether results are statistically significant in the context of your research question.

Geospatial skills are also assessed. Using GIS can add clarity and rigour to your investigation by enabling you to layer data, produce accurate maps, calculate areas and distances, and visualise spatial patterns. Even if you cannot access advanced software, clear hand-drawn maps, accurate OS maps, annotated photographs and overlays demonstrate spatial awareness. When using remote or crowd-sourced data be critical about provenance, resolution and any inherent biases. Qualitative data demand different techniques: coding interview transcripts, identifying themes in textual and visual sources, and triangulating interview accounts with observational and statistical evidence strengthens the credibility of your conclusions.

## Presenting findings, evaluation and the assessment criteria
Your write-up must be coherent and structured, leading logically from introduction and methods through to analysis, conclusions and evaluation. Presentation methods should be varied and appropriate; maps, charts, tables and photographs help readers follow complex arguments. The 3,000–4,000 word limit includes all main text and captions but excludes appendices, which should contain only raw data examples rather than every original questionnaire. In the evaluation, you should reflect on limitations of your methods, sources of error and the extent to which your sample and timing were representative. Discuss how your findings relate to wider theory and situate conclusions within the specification content or broader geographical debates. Consider opportunities for further research and practical improvements.

Assessment focuses on four areas: the introduction and preliminary research, methods of field investigation, methods of critical analysis, and conclusions, evaluation and presentation. At top level you will show a clearly focused research question grounded in literature, detailed and justified methods, effective and appropriate analytical techniques that interrogate data and extend understanding, and a coherent, well-evidenced argument with reflective evaluation of ethics and limitations. Lower level work tends to be more general, with limited justification of methods, tenuous application of theory, incomplete analysis and superficial conclusions. Teachers will annotate evidence and sign to confirm that the mark awarded reflects unaided achievement where independence is required.

## Common pitfalls and practical tips for success
Common errors include having an aim that is too broad, relying solely on secondary data, poor sampling that prevents meaningful analysis, and failing to contextualise findings within theory. To avoid these problems choose a manageable question with a clear spatial focus and a small number of testable hypotheses or aims. Pilot your methods before the main field day to check that equipment and techniques work and to refine sampling. Keep meticulous field notes, date and time every observation, label photographs and back up digital data as soon as possible. When writing, integrate maps and figures into the narrative rather than relegating them to appendices, and always explain what each piece of evidence contributes to your argument. Be precise about uncertainties; discussing error sources and how they change interpretations often strengthens, rather than weakens, your conclusions.

For classroom practice, use local contexts to build skills: a nearby river catchment is excellent for hydrological data, town centres reveal commercial change and place perception, and coastal sites demonstrate sediment dynamics and management. Use these settings to practise both lab and field techniques, and to build confidence with statistics and GIS before the independent investigation.

## Exam technique
When preparing for exam questions and the NEA, remember that assessment rewards clarity, relevance and evidence. In exams apply geographical concepts explicitly; name the theory you are using, relate it to the question and use examples to support points. For extended prose answers, plan briefly so that you have a clear structure of introduction, development and conclusion. In the NEA ensure that each section of your write-up maps onto the assessment criteria: the introduction must justify the question and demonstrate preliminary research, methods must be justified and replicable, analysis should use appropriate statistical and spatial techniques, and conclusions must be directly tied back to the research question with a balanced evaluation. Manage your time in the field to secure enough quality data for reliable analysis, and in the write-up allocate wordage wisely so that methods and analysis receive sufficient attention rather than being crowded out by descriptive background. Finally, keep academic honesty at the forefront: always reference secondary sources properly, include a completed CRF, and own your interpretation. Clear planning, practiced techniques and thoughtful reflection will lift your fieldwork from collection to convincing geographical argument.
