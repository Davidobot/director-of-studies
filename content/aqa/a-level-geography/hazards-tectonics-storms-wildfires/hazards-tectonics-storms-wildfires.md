## What is a hazard? Perception, risk and vulnerability
A hazard is any natural process or phenomenon that has the potential to cause harm to people, property or the environment. It is important to distinguish hazard from disaster: a hazard becomes a disaster when it intersects with human vulnerability and exposure in such a way that lives are lost, livelihoods are damaged and normal functioning is disrupted. Risk is the probability of that harm occurring multiplied by the likely magnitude of the consequences; vulnerability is the susceptibility of a population or place to damage when a hazard occurs. Hazard perception varies between communities and is shaped by economic capacity, culture, past experience and political context. For example, fatalism may lead some communities to accept high exposure, whereas others will prioritise avoidance or mitigation.

Two useful conceptual tools that help structure study and exam answers are the Park model of human response to hazards and the Hazard Management Cycle. The Park model plots quality of life before, during and after an event, showing the immediate dip when a disaster occurs and the rate and extent of recovery. The Hazard Management Cycle frames action as mitigation (reducing exposure and vulnerability), preparedness (planning and education), response (immediate actions during an event) and recovery (rebuilding and adaptation). Together these models help you explain not only what happens in a hazard event but also how people, systems and policies influence outcomes.

## Plate tectonics and seismic/volcanic processes
The vast majority of volcanic and seismic hazards are driven by plate tectonics. The Earth is layered: a thin, brittle crust overlays the hotter, more plastic mantle and a metallic core. The crust is broken into tectonic plates that move relative to one another. At constructive (divergent) margins new crust forms; at destructive (convergent) margins one plate is consumed beneath another, producing subduction zones; and at conservative (transform) margins plates slide past one another. Plate motion is driven by processes including ridge push, slab pull and mantle convection. Hotspots or magma plumes produce volcanic activity away from plate boundaries.

These plate interactions control the location, frequency and type of seismicity and volcanism. Subduction zones generate powerful earthquakes and explosive, gas-rich volcanism. Ocean ridges produce frequent but usually less violent, basaltic eruptions. Transform faults generate strike-slip earthquakes. When an earthquake displaces the seafloor it can generate a tsunami, a fast-moving wave with catastrophic potential on nearby coastlines. Understanding these processes allows explanation of spatial patterns of hazards, for example the Ring of Fire around the Pacific.

When writing about seismic and volcanic processes, be precise about mechanisms. Explain how magma viscosity and gas content determine eruption style (low-viscosity basaltic magma produces effusive lava flows, while high-viscosity andesitic or rhyolitic magma produces explosive eruptions and pyroclastic flows). Make clear the difference between magnitude (energy released, commonly measured by moment magnitude) and intensity (local effects, measured by scales such as the Modified Mercalli Intensity).

## Volcanic hazards: types, impacts and responses
Volcanic hazards include lava flows, pyroclastic density currents (nuées ardentes), ash fall, volcanic gases, lahars (volcanic mudflows) and tephra. Ash can devastate agriculture, disrupt air travel, damage engines and cause roof collapse when thick, while pyroclastic flows are among the deadliest volcanic phenomena because of their speed and temperature.

Classic recent examples help illustrate impacts and human responses. The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland produced extensive ash that disrupted European airspace for days, stressing the global dependency on aviation and exposing the economic consequences of ash clouds. Mount Pinatubo’s 1991 eruption produced a far larger climatic signal, injecting sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere and lowering global temperatures temporarily, while causing major local devastation and long-term social disruption. Smaller, more localised eruptions such as Mount St Helens (1980) show how pyroclastic flows and lahars can reshape landscapes and destroy infrastructure.

Responses combine short-term emergency actions and long-term risk reduction. Monitoring (seismicity, ground deformation, gas emissions) and early warning systems are essential components of preparedness. Evacuation plans, exclusion zones, land-use planning and community education reduce vulnerability. In some places engineering (larva diversion channels, drainage control to reduce lahars) is applied; in others, economic compensation, resettlement and alternative livelihoods are pursued. The effectiveness of measures often reflects development level: wealthier societies can fund monitoring networks and enforce zoning, whereas low-income communities may rely on traditional coping strategies and external aid.

## Seismic hazards: earthquakes, tsunamis and consequences
Earthquakes occur when accumulated stress on a fault is released suddenly. Their effects depend on depth, distance from epicentre, local geology and the quality of construction. Shallow earthquakes close to urban areas often cause the greatest damage. Secondary effects such as landslides, liquefaction and tsunamis can magnify impacts. Liquefaction, where saturated sediments lose strength and behave like a fluid, can cause buildings to tilt or sink. Tsunamis, triggered by undersea earthquakes or submarine landslides, radiate energy across oceans and can devastate distant coastlines.

Comparing events at different development levels makes the role of human factors clear. The 2010 Haiti earthquake, with high death tolls and widespread collapse of poorly constructed buildings, highlighted the catastrophic consequences of high vulnerability, dense urban poverty and limited preparedness. In contrast, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, although far larger in magnitude and causing over 15,000 deaths, showed more resilient infrastructure and effective early-warning systems; nevertheless, the disaster exposed vulnerabilities in complex systems when the tsunami triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis. These comparisons are central to exam answers because they show how physical processes interact with social systems.

Mitigation strategies for seismic hazards include strict building codes, retrofitting of structures, land-use planning that avoids known fault lines and tsunami evacuation routes and early-warning systems that give seconds or minutes to take protective action. Post-event responses require coordinated emergency services, international aid and long-term reconstruction that reduces future vulnerability.

## Tropical storms: formation, hazards and changing risks
Tropical storms (hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones) form over warm tropical oceans where sea surface temperatures and atmospheric conditions support persistent convection and an organised low-pressure system. The principal hazards associated with tropical storms are extreme winds, intense precipitation causing river and flash flooding, storm surge that can flood coastal zones, and consequential landslides on steep terrain.

Two contrasting recent examples illustrate varied impacts. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in 2013 struck the central Philippines with devastating storm surge and extreme winds, destroying whole coastal communities and killing thousands. The intensity of impact was exacerbated by low-lying settlements, limited evacuation infrastructure and poverty. Hurricane Harvey (2017) brought extraordinary rainfall to the Houston region, producing catastrophic fluvial and urban flooding while highlighting how urban development on floodplains and impermeable surfaces increases flood risk in high-income settings. Both cases demonstrate that vulnerability and land-use decisions are as important as storm magnitude in determining disaster outcomes.

Forecasting and early-warning systems have improved globally, making accurate track forecasts several days ahead possible. Preparedness (clear evacuation routes, shelters, public messaging), structural defences such as seawalls and mangrove restoration to reduce storm surge, land-use planning, and insurance mechanisms form the spectrum of risk reduction. Climate change is increasing sea surface temperatures and raising sea levels; these changes are expected to increase storm intensity and the potential for more damaging storm surges and heavier rainfall, so explanations in exams should link physical mechanisms to changing risk profiles.

## Wildfires: fuels, behaviour and management
Wildfires are natural and human-influenced events that occur where flammable vegetation, dry weather and an ignition source coincide. Fire behaviour depends on fuel type and continuity, weather conditions (especially wind and humidity) and topography (fires move upslope faster). Some ecosystems are adapted to fire and even require fire for regeneration, but intense, large-scale wildfires can destroy property, pollute air, cause loss of life and damage soils.

Recent extreme wildfire seasons provide useful contemporary examples. The Australian “Black Summer” of 2019–2020 burnt millions of hectares, destroyed thousands of homes and raised global attention to how prolonged drought, heatwaves and accumulated fuels can lead to unprecedented fire seasons. In California, the 2018 Camp Fire illustrated the interplay between ageing infrastructure, fire weather and community vulnerability. Both incidents demonstrate that while some fires are ignited by natural causes such as lightning, many are started by human agency and that the escalating risk is often tied to climate trends and patterns of land management.

Management mixes prevention, suppression and adaptation. Prevention measures include public education, regulations on ignition sources, controlled burns and vegetation management to reduce fuel loads. Suppression relies on firefighting resources and rapid response, while adaptation involves designing buildings and communities for fire resilience, strategic land-use planning, insurance and community preparedness. In many landscapes, the debate between suppression (which can lead to fuel build-up) and the reintroduction of prescribed burning is a central policy issue.

## Human responses, management and governance
Effective hazard management recognises the multi-scalar nature of risk and combines structural and non-structural measures. Structural measures such as seawalls, levees and earthquake-resistant buildings reduce physical exposure. Non-structural measures including land-use planning, early-warning systems, public education, insurance schemes and disaster risk financing address vulnerability and recovery capacity. Governance involves local preparedness, national planning and international cooperation for shared hazards and aid. NGOs and community organisations often play crucial roles in preparedness and recovery, especially where state capacity is limited.

Hazard management must be context-sensitive. In some places, relocation or managed retreat from high-risk zones is the only sustainable option; in others, investment in protective infrastructure and community resilience is justified. Long-term adaptation puts hazard management into the broader context of sustainable development and climate adaptation, calling for integrated strategies that consider social equity, environmental sustainability and economic viability.

## Case studies and how to study them
When preparing case studies, choose examples that let you cover physical processes, impacts, responses and the role of human factors. For a multi-hazard environment beyond the UK, the Philippines or Indonesia are excellent choices because they experience earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and tropical storms. Discuss the physical reasons for hazard concentration, document specific events and show how governance, development and culture affect outcomes and recovery. For a local-scale study, select a place you can describe in detail: the physical setting, the socio-economic profile, how risk is managed and how residents experience hazards. Use quantitative data where available (mortality, economic loss, recovery times) and include qualitative sources (first-person accounts, media representation) to explain perceptions and responses.

When choosing examples for the exam, aim to have at least one well-developed “global” case study and one detailed local or national case study. Be ready to adapt either to question prompts; know key dates, the sequence of events, primary and secondary impacts, short- and long-term responses, and the successes and limitations of management strategies. Always link specific evidence to broader concepts such as resilience, vulnerability, mitigation and adaptation.

## Exam technique
Begin answers by directly addressing the command word. If asked to “describe”, set out features clearly; if asked to “explain”, link causes to effects; if asked to “assess” or “evaluate”, weigh strengths and limitations and reach a reasoned judgement. Use the Park model and Hazard Management Cycle where relevant to structure responses about impacts and responses. Always include specific examples: name, date and place are essential to show depth. When discussing processes, use accurate physical terminology (for example, subduction, pyroclastic flow, storm surge, liquefaction) and where appropriate explain mechanisms (how sea-floor displacement creates tsunamis, how magma viscosity affects eruption style). For synoptic links, explicitly connect hazards to wider themes such as climate change, globalisation or development.

In extended answers, structure your response with an introduction that defines key terms and outlines your approach, a series of well-developed paragraphs each focused on a single idea or link between ideas, and a clear conclusion that summarizes your judgement. Use evidence and data to support points, and evaluate the reliability or limits of that evidence when appropriate. Balance physical explanation with human geography: the best answers integrate both. Time management is crucial: allocate time proportional to mark values, leave time to plan and to proofread, and in longer responses aim for clarity and logical progression rather than over-complexity. Finally, practise writing concise, evidence-led paragraphs under timed conditions so that in the exam you can convert knowledge into high-scoring answers efficiently.
