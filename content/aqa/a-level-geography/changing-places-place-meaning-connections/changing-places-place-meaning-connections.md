# Changing places: place, meaning and connections (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: what this topic covers and why it matters
Changing places is centrally concerned with how people experience, shape and understand the locations they live in and visit. It asks what makes a place distinctive, how places evolve over time and how connections beyond a locality influence local change. At A-level this topic combines theory and practical enquiry: you must study two contrasting places, one of which must be local, and use a range of qualitative and quantitative evidence to explain how people’s lived experience and external forces produce continuity and change. The topic sits at the intersection of human geography, cultural meaning and policy, and it provides rich opportunities for fieldwork, GIS and media analysis. Mastering it helps you think about identity, power and the processes by which places are made and remade.

## The concept of place and insider/outsider perspectives
Place is more than a set of coordinates on a map; it is a location invested with meaning through human practices, relationships and histories. Geographers distinguish between ‘space’—an abstract location—and ‘place’—a space with meaning. Two important perspectives to use are insider and outsider viewpoints. An insider perspective is grounded in lived experience: long-term residents understand the rhythms, social networks and informal rules of a place. An outsider perspective comes from visitors, investors, media or policymakers who may see the place differently, sometimes reducing it to a stereotype or an economic opportunity. These contrasting viewpoints can coexist and clash: a media campaign promoting a city as a cultural hub may attract tourists and investment but at the same time alter everyday life and affordability for local residents. Being able to articulate and compare insider and outsider perspectives is a key skill in this topic.

## Endogenous and exogenous factors shaping places
The character of any place is produced by a mix of endogenous and exogenous factors. Endogenous factors are internal to the place: physical setting, topography, historical land uses, built environment, local demographics and existing infrastructure. Exogenous factors are the external relationships and flows that connect the place to wider systems: investment from national government, decisions by transnational corporations, migration streams, transport links and media representations. For example, a port town’s endogenous features—its harbour location and shipyards—combine with exogenous influences such as global trade patterns and shipping companies’ choices to determine employment opportunities and land use. Understanding how these factors interact lets you explain why places change at particular moments and in particular directions rather than simply describing change.

## Relationships, connections and the forms of change
AQA requires that place study engages with relationships and connections, and with either changing demographic and cultural characteristics or economic change and social inequalities. These themes are closely linked because shifts in employment and investment often drive migration and cultural transformation, while demographic changes and cultural practices can attract or repel investment. Places are affected by flows of people—immigration and internal migration—that alter population structure, ethnicity, languages, services and housing demand. They are also shaped by flows of capital and ideas: regeneration schemes, gentrification driven by cultural amenities, and transnational corporate strategies can all transform local economies and social relations. To explain change, it helps to use concrete examples. The regeneration of Bilbao around the Guggenheim museum provides a clear case of cultural-led economic change that rebranded the city to attract tourism and investment, while also raising debates about who benefits and who is displaced. Shenzhen, which transformed from a fishing village into a global manufacturing city following its designation as a special economic zone, illustrates how policy-led exogenous forces can produce rapid demographic and economic change.

## Meaning and representation: how places are presented and experienced
Places are not only materially changed; they are represented in many ways and those representations matter. Media places—representations in advertising, film, travel guides, official planning documents and social media—create powerful images that influence outsiders’ perceptions and insiders’ sense of identity. Artistic and popular portrayals can celebrate a place, reduce it to a problem or create a tourist-friendly brand. Equally important are everyday representations: local narratives, oral histories, graffiti and community events that express attachments, memories and contestations over meaning. Critical analysis of representations should ask whose voice is heard and whose is marginalised. Developers and local authorities often attempt to craft place-meanings deliberately—for example, through marketing campaigns or flagship developments—yet these attempts may be resisted by community groups who maintain alternative understandings rooted in history and everyday practice.

## Designing place studies: data, methods and ethical practice
Place studies must be evidence-based and combine qualitative and quantitative approaches. Quantitative sources include census data, population statistics, employment and economic indicators, land-use change maps and geospatial datasets that can be analysed with GIS. Qualitative sources include interviews, participant observation, oral histories, photographic archives, local newspapers and representations in film and social media. Field methods commonly used are transects to record changes in land use or building condition, structured questionnaires to capture attitudes, semi-structured interviews for deeper narratives, and photographic surveys to document physical transformation. When designing a study you should balance approaches: use statistical change over time to show demographic or economic shifts, and use interviews and media analysis to interpret the meanings and lived experiences behind those numbers. Ethical practice is essential: obtain informed consent for interviews, be sensitive when working in marginalised communities, anonymise personal data where appropriate, and reflect on your positionality—how your presence and background may influence responses.

## Analysing and evaluating change: theory, power and critique
Analysis should move beyond description to explanation and critical evaluation. Theories that help include place-making, sense of place, social production of space, and ideas about power and inequality. Use these frameworks to interrogate who benefits from change and why, and to assess the sustainability of interventions. For instance, gentrification can be explained as a process where cultural investments and rising property values attract wealthier residents, producing spatial segregation and housing stress for lower-income households. Evaluate alternative perspectives: a regeneration scheme may boost jobs and local pride but also result in displacement; similarly, tourism can bring income while undermining affordability and local culture. Always return to evidence: link theory to your data, show how statistics indicate change, and use residents’ voices to illustrate lived consequences. A balanced evaluation recognises complexity and avoids simplistic judgements.

## Choosing and using examples: how to meet the specification’s place-study requirements
Your place studies must be rooted in two contrasting locations: one local to your home or study centre and one contrasting and distant. The contrasting place should differ significantly in economic development, population density, cultural background or political/economic systems. Effective choices are those where clear data are available and where you can access both quantitative datasets and qualitative material—even remotely, through archives and media. A local study might examine a nearby neighbourhood experiencing studentification, gentrification or retail decline. A contrasting place might be an internationally known example such as Bilbao, Detroit, Dharavi (Mumbai) or Shenzhen; alternatively it could be a rural area undergoing tourism-led change. In both studies you must give equal attention to people’s lived experience in the past and present and to either changing demographic/cultural characteristics or economic change/social inequalities, as specified. Use maps and census tables to show trends over time and complement these with interviews, photographic sequences and media analysis to demonstrate changing meanings and representations.

## Exam technique
Answer questions with clarity by linking concepts, evidence and evaluation. For short-answer questions start with concise definitions—define ‘place’, ‘endogenous/exogenous factors’ or ‘insider/outsider’—and then give a specific example or statistic. For data-response or mid-length questions integrate quantitative evidence (for example, census figures showing age-structure change or maps showing land-use shifts) with qualitative points about lived experience. For extended essays plan your response with a clear introduction that defines terms and sets out the case study locations you will use. Structure the body into clear paragraphs that each make a single analytical point: introduce the point, apply theory or concept, provide evidence from your place studies (both local and contrasting), and evaluate by considering alternative interpretations or consequences. Always signpost case studies so the examiner can see you are meeting the requirement to embed knowledge in real places; name your local place and your contrasting place and balance their use across your answer. Use key vocabulary—placemaking, sense of place, representation, flows, regeneration, gentrification, insider/outsider—to demonstrate command of the topic. In evaluation paragraphs consider power, who benefits, sustainability and whether the changes are reversible or entrenched. Time management is essential: allocate time proportionally to the marks, leaving minutes at the end to check that you have defined terms, included examples and written a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Where exam tasks ask for methods or fieldwork evidence, be ready to describe your use of quantitative sources (census, GIS, maps) and qualitative sources (interviews, media analysis), and to reflect briefly on strengths and limitations and ethical considerations. Practice writing short case-study summaries that you can adapt under exam conditions so you can quickly integrate relevant, specific evidence into answers.
