# Glacial systems and landscapes (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: why study glaciated landscapes
Glaciated landscapes offer striking examples of how climate, energy and lithology combine to shape the Earth’s surface. Many of the features we associate with mountains and some lowland regions were sculpted by ice during the Pleistocene and continue to be modified by contemporary glaciers and periglacial processes. Studying glacial systems develops an understanding of systems thinking—stores, flows, inputs and outputs—and how feedbacks and thresholds operate over different timescales. For A-level geography this topic links physical process knowledge to landscape outcomes and to contemporary issues such as water resources, natural hazards and climate change. It is also excellent for fieldwork: glaciers, their deposits and periglacial landforms can be mapped, measured and analysed with a wide range of quantitative and qualitative techniques.

## Glaciers as natural systems
A glacier is not just a mass of ice; it is a dynamic system with inputs and outputs, stores and transfers of mass and energy. Inputs are primarily snowfall and accumulation of firn and snowpack, while outputs are ablation processes such as melting, sublimation and calving. The balance between accumulation and ablation—the glacial budget—determines whether a glacier advances, retreats or remains in dynamic equilibrium. The altitude of the equilibrium line (ELA) and the spatial distribution of accumulation and ablation zones are fundamental controls on glacier behaviour. Warm-based and cold-based glaciers illustrate contrasting sub-systems: warm-based glaciers have meltwater at their beds that lubricates basal sliding and enhances erosion, whereas cold-based glaciers are frozen to their beds and typically produce much less abrasion. Recognising the glacier as a system helps explain both short-term seasonal changes and the longer-term responses of glaciers to climate forcing.

## Processes: movement, erosion, transportation and deposition
Glacial movement occurs by internal deformation of the ice and by basal processes. Internal deformation involves the slow flow of ice crystals under stress, producing patterns of strain such as compressional and extensional flow that shape the glacier’s longitudinal profile. Basal sliding occurs where meltwater reduces friction between ice and bed; the presence and pressure of subglacial water also control the capacity for rapid surges in some glaciers. Erosional processes include plucking—where meltwater refreezes in bedrock cracks and removes blocks—and abrasion where rock fragments embedded in the ice grind the bed, producing striations and rock flour. These processes create classic erosional landforms such as corries (cirques), arêtes and U-shaped glacial troughs.

Fluvioglacial processes are driven by meltwater. Meltwater streams beneath and in front of glaciers transport and sort sediments, producing features distinct from direct glacial deposition. High-energy meltwater channels carve meltwater channels and tunnel valleys; deposition of well-sorted sands and gravels forms outwash plains, kames and eskers. Periglacial processes dominate cold, non-glacial ground where freeze–thaw, solifluction and permafrost dynamics create patterned ground, ice wedges and pingos. These processes operate across a range of seasonal and longer timescales and leave diagnostic landforms that can be used to infer past environmental conditions.

## Landforms and landscape development
Glaciated landscapes are a composite of erosional and depositional features whose distribution depends on glacier type, bedrock, relief and the history of ice advance and retreat. Classic erosional landforms include corries, which form by nivation and rotational flow; arêtes and horns formed where multiple cirques erode a mountain; hanging valleys and truncated spurs created where tributary and main glaciers erode to different depths; and roches moutonnées, which reveal flow direction through their stoss-and-lee morphology. Depositional landforms formed by ice include moraines (lateral, medial, terminal and recessional), drumlins—streamlined hills of glacial till often found in swarms—and erratics, large boulders transported long distances and deposited on contrasting lithologies.

Fluvioglacial deposits produce characteristic forms: eskers are sinuous ridges of sand and gravel laid down by subglacial streams, kames are mounds formed by sediment in ice crevasses and depressions, and outwash plains are broad areas of sorted sediment beyond the ice margin. Periglacial landforms such as pingos (ice-cored hills), patterned ground and thermokarst terrain tell us about past and present permafrost processes. Understanding the relationship between process, time and form is essential: many British landscapes, for example, show the legacy of Pleistocene ice through U-shaped valleys, truncated spurs and extensive moraine belts, while fjord landscapes such as Norway’s Sognefjord record deep glacial excavation and subsequent sea-level transgression.

## The nature and distribution of cold environments
Cold environments include polar, alpine, glacial and periglacial zones, each with distinct climates, soils and vegetation that interact with geomorphic processes. Present-day glaciers are distributed from the high latitudes of Greenland and Antarctica to alpine regions like the Alps, Himalaya and Andes, and temperate mountain ranges such as the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Pleistocene glaciations extended ice much further: much of northern Europe, North America and parts of Asia were covered by ice sheets. Recognising the spatial patterns of present and past cold environments helps explain the geographic distribution of glacial landforms and deposits. For example, the extensive drumlin fields of Ireland and parts of the North American Midwest reflect ice-sheet dynamics, while the sharp horn of the Matterhorn is a product of alpine cirque erosion.

## Human impacts, fragility and management
Cold environments are often fragile and sensitive to disturbance. Glacial retreat driven by recent warming has visible impacts: reduced glacier mass threatens seasonal water supplies for downstream communities, alters sediment regimes and can increase hazard risk through the formation and instability of proglacial lakes. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a particular concern in mountain regions such as the Himalaya and the Andes where moraine-dammed lakes can fail. Permafrost thaw undermines infrastructure in Arctic settlements and increases greenhouse gas release from formerly frozen organic matter, creating feedbacks with climate.

Human activities—tourism, hydropower development, mining and road construction—can intensify environmental change in cold regions. Management aims include monitoring (mass-balance and terminus position), early warning for GLOFs, controlled drainage, local adaptation of water supplies and planning restrictions in unstable periglacial terrain. Internationally, conservation policies and protected areas attempt to balance economic opportunities and the protection of unique cold-environment ecosystems. For A-level study it is important to evaluate both the environmental consequences and the socio-economic trade-offs involved in different management strategies.

## Fieldwork and quantitative/qualitative skills
Glacial systems lend themselves to a wide range of field techniques and analytical methods. Fieldwork can include mapping of moraines and drumlin orientations, measuring sediment size and clast lithology to infer transport distances, installing stakes to measure glacier movement or using repeated photography and GPS to document terminus retreat. Key quantitative skills include calculating simple mass balance from accumulation and ablation measurements, applying descriptive statistics to grain-size distributions, and using Spearman’s rank or chi-square tests to explore relationships such as the correlation between altitude and moraine size. Cartographic skills—interpreting topographic profiles, reading contour patterns on maps and producing cross-sections—are essential when reconstructing valley form and ice flow direction. Qualitative approaches such as interviews with local communities can enrich understanding of human responses to glacier change and the cultural meanings attached to cold landscapes. Integration of GIS and remote sensing is increasingly important for analysing glacier area change, mapping proglacial lakes and deriving hypsometric curves for catchment analysis.

## Case studies: applying theory to places
Good revision uses named case studies that illustrate processes, landforms and human interactions. The fjords of western Norway (for example Sognefjord) exemplify deep glacial erosion, post-glacial sea-level rise and the interplay between glacial troughs and marine transgression. The Alps provide classic alpine glaciation features: corries, arêtes and hanging valleys, with well-documented retreat of valley glaciers such as the Rhône and Mer de Glace. In North America, Glacier National Park in Montana (USA) and the drumlin fields of County Down and elsewhere in Ireland illustrate ice-sheet and valley-glacier contrasts; Alaska and the Patagonian icefields (Perito Moreno, the Southern Patagonian Ice Field) highlight contemporary glacier retreat, calving dynamics and social-economic implications including tourism and water resources. Periglacial examples such as pingos and patterned ground are well demonstrated in the Canadian Arctic (Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula) and Siberia, where permafrost thaw produces thermokarst and infrastructure problems. When using case studies, make sure each is clearly linked to the relevant processes, management issues and, where possible, field evidence that could be collected or analysed.

## Exam technique
In exam answers, start by demonstrating systems thinking: define the glacier system or landform, locate it spatially and state the timescale under consideration. Use clear process-based explanations—describe mechanisms (for example, how plucking and abrasion work) before linking them to landform development. Where a question asks for causes and consequences, structure your response so that causes are directly tied to outcomes and consider both natural and human factors. Always use specific examples to support general points; named case studies (for instance, a Norwegian fjord, the Matterhorn, or a Himalayan GLOF event) add credibility and depth. For synoptic and evaluative questions, compare contrasting settings (warm- versus cold-based glaciers, high-latitude ice sheets versus alpine glaciers) and weigh strengths and limitations of management responses. In fieldwork questions, be precise about methods, sampling strategies and how you would test hypotheses using statistics or GIS. Finally, plan longer responses: include a brief introduction that outlines the argument, develop points in linked paragraphs that move from process to evidence to implication, and finish with a concise conclusion that addresses the question directly.
