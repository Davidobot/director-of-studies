# Population and the environment (A-level Geography Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: why study population–environment relationships
Population and the environment are tightly interwoven: where people live, how many of them there are, and how they live all depend on environmental context, while the environment in turn is shaped by human activity. This topic explores those two‑way relationships at a variety of scales, from local neighbourhoods to entire regions and the globe. You will learn to read physical controls such as climate, soils and water availability as factors that shape agriculture, health and settlement patterns. Equally, you will examine how demographic processes — births, deaths and migration — and economic development alter landscapes, demand resources and affect ecosystem services. The key to success is to link human and physical geography concepts, to apply models where helpful, and to use quantitative and qualitative evidence to test explanations and evaluate policy responses.

## Environment and food: climate, soils and agricultural productivity
Food production is the most direct link between population and the physical environment. Climatic variables such as temperature and rainfall control the length of growing seasons and the range of viable crops. In tropical climates the wet and dry seasons, high temperatures and intense solar radiation favour certain crops and high rates of biological activity, but also create pressures such as soil leaching and rapid organic matter turnover. In temperate climates cooler temperatures and regular precipitation support different cereal and root crops, and slower decomposition means more stable soil organic matter.

Soils are equally critical. Zonal soils illustrate how climate and vegetation produce characteristic soil types: for example, lateritic soils develop in hot, wet tropical zones where intense weathering removes soluble minerals and leaves iron‑ and aluminium‑rich horizons; podzols form under cool, moist coniferous or heathland vegetation and are typically acidic with a bleached eluvial layer. A third useful contrast is chernozem, a fertile black soil of temperate grasslands prized for cereal production. Agricultural productivity depends not simply on the inherent fertility of soils, but on their management. Problems such as erosion, waterlogging, salinisation and structural deterioration can rapidly reduce yields unless addressed through crop rotation, conservation agriculture, drainage, terracing, or controlled irrigation.

Food security for growing populations is managed through a mix of increased productivity (intensification, improved seeds, mechanisation), expanded area under cultivation, trade (importing calories), and technological solutions such as protected agriculture and irrigation. Climate change introduces uncertainty by altering rainfall patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme events, so adaptation measures — crop diversification, climate‑smart agriculture and improved storage and transport infrastructure — are vital.

## Environment, health and well‑being: disease, pollution and infrastructure
Environmental conditions are major determinants of health outcomes. Water quality and sanitation, air quality, housing and drainage, and the presence of disease vectors all interact with social and economic factors to shape mortality and morbidity patterns. Communicable diseases have well‑documented links to the environment: vector‑borne diseases such as malaria depend on the ecology of the mosquito vector, which requires standing water for breeding and a warm temperature range for parasite development. Seasonal cycles of rainfall and temperature therefore influence incidence, and environmental modifications — draining swamps, improving housing and reducing standing water — are core disease‑control strategies. Human interventions such as irrigation schemes can reduce or sometimes increase transmission risk depending on management.

Non‑communicable diseases (NCDs) are now a major part of the global disease burden and are related to both environment and lifestyle. Air pollution from urbanisation and industrial activity contributes to respiratory illnesses, asthma and cardiovascular disease. Dietary changes associated with urban, higher‑income lifestyles increase risks of coronary heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. The epidemiological transition describes the shift from high mortality from infectious disease and high fertility to lower infectious mortality and increasing prominence of NCDs as countries develop. International agencies and NGOs play key roles in disease surveillance, vaccination programmes, distribution of interventions such as bed nets, and in shaping global health responses.

When studying environment and health, focus on how physical factors (climate, drainage, pollution) intersect with socio‑economic variables (poverty, access to healthcare, education) to produce outcomes, and how interventions operate at household, community and national scales.

## Population change and migration: models, drivers and consequences
Understanding population change requires mastery of the demographic transition model, which links falling death rates and later falling birth rates to economic development, improvements in healthcare and changing social norms. Early stages of the model show high birth and death rates and slow population growth. As mortality falls, particularly among infants and children, populations can grow rapidly until fertility declines. The demographic dividend refers to a period when the proportion of working‑age people rises relative to dependents, creating a potential boost to economic development if jobs and education are available.

Age–sex structure, fertility rates, mortality rates and dependency ratios are the quantitative tools you will use to describe populations. Population change is not only natural increase; migration plays a major role. International migration includes refugees and asylum seekers fleeing conflict or persecution, economic migrants seeking better livelihoods, and environmental migrants displaced by hazard or gradual environmental change. Internal migration — often rural‑to‑urban — underpins urbanisation and reshapes settlement patterns. Migration has demographic, economic, social and political implications: remittances can support household welfare, but rapid in‑migration can strain urban infrastructures and services.

Apply models critically: demographic transition patterns vary across countries and can be influenced by policy (pro‑ or anti‑natalist measures), cultural preferences and shocks such as pandemics. Consider both push factors (environmental degradation, lack of livelihoods) and pull factors (jobs and services in cities) when explaining flows.

## Population ecology concepts: carrying capacity, ecological footprint and debates on population
Population ecology principles borrowed from biological sciences help frame debates about limits and sustainability. Carrying capacity is the maximum population that a given environment can sustain indefinitely with current technology and consumption patterns. Ecological footprint converts resource use into a common metric to estimate how much biologically productive land and water an individual, population or activity requires; many developed countries have per capita footprints far above global biocapacity.

Debates about the implications of population growth have long histories. Malthusian perspectives warn that unchecked population growth will outstrip food supply, resulting in famine and decline. Neo‑Malthusian views adapt that concern to contemporary resource and environmental limits. In contrast, theories such as those associated with Ester Boserup suggest that necessity drives innovation: agricultural intensification and technological advances can raise yields to meet demand. More optimistic market‑based views, associated with Julian Simon, argue that human ingenuity and economic incentives can substitute for resource scarcity. Critically evaluate each perspective: they emphasise different mechanisms and policy responses, and real‑world outcomes often reflect combinations of resource limits, technological change, political choices and distributional inequalities.

When answering questions, show command of quantitative measures such as population density, per capita resource use, and the concept of the demographic dividend, while recognising that simple arithmetic of people versus resources is insufficient without considering consumption patterns and technology.

## Global population futures and environmental implications
Projections of global population to mid‑century and beyond highlight several challenges. An ageing population in some regions will increase demand for healthcare and pensions, while rapid youthful growth in others requires enormous investment in education and jobs. Climate change threatens to shift agricultural zones, reduce yields in some tropical regions, and expand the ranges of many disease vectors. Sea‑level rise and more intense storms will put low‑lying coastal populations at risk, potentially creating significant migration pressures.

The interaction of population trends with urbanisation, consumption patterns and technology will determine future pressures on food, water and energy. Sustainable development requires integrating mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions with adaptation measures that protect vulnerable populations. Policy approaches must therefore be multi‑scalar: local natural resource management and health programmes, national education and population policies, and international cooperation on climate, trade and development.

For exam answers and fieldwork, think in scenarios and be willing to evaluate alternative futures rather than present single deterministic predictions. Use examples to show how different trajectories play out in particular contexts.

## Case study practice: linking theory to places
Case studies are central to demonstrating understanding. For rapid population growth, a useful example is Nigeria, where high fertility, youthful age structure and urbanisation combine to create both opportunities and challenges. You can discuss agricultural pressures in the north, urban squatter settlements in Lagos, the potential demographic dividend, and the interplay between governance and service provision. For population decline and ageing, Japan offers clear contrasts: low fertility, lengthening life expectancy and the economic consequences of a shrinking workforce, with policy responses including automation, immigration debates and pension reform.

On health and environment at a local scale, a fieldwork study might examine the relationship between water quality and gastrointestinal disease in a coastal town, using water testing, household surveys and clinic records. Another local focus could be mapping respiratory hospital admissions against traffic density and particulate pollution, combining spatial analysis with interviews that reveal perceptions and coping strategies. Good case studies combine quantitative evidence (rates, maps, test results) with qualitative insight (interviews, policy context) and always draw out the broader implications for sustainability and equity.

When preparing case studies, choose places you know well or can research thoroughly, and ensure that you can explain causes, consequences and responses. Balance local detail with links to global patterns to show breadth and depth.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions, read the command words carefully and tailor your response accordingly. For "describe" and "outline" tasks give clear, factual accounts; for "explain" and "analyse" you must link causes and effects and use theory such as the demographic transition or carrying capacity. For extended responses, structure your answer with a clear introduction setting out your argument, a sequenced body where each paragraph makes a distinct point supported by evidence, and a conclusion that evaluates the argument and acknowledges uncertainty or alternative perspectives.

Integrate case studies explicitly: name the place, give relevant statistics or findings, and use them to illustrate theoretical points rather than as isolated anecdotes. Where appropriate, include quantitative evidence such as rates, dependency ratios or ecological footprint figures, and comment on data quality and representativeness. Use geographical techniques where they add value: maps or annotated diagrams can show spatial patterns succinctly; age‑sex pyramids and trends in mortality or fertility are useful for explaining demographic processes.

For evaluation, compare contrasts (for example, rural versus urban or developed versus developing contexts), assess the effectiveness of policies, and consider scale — local interventions may not be feasible at national scale, and global governance has limits. Manage your time by allocating minutes per mark and leave a few minutes to proofread and add links between paragraphs. For non‑exam assessment and fieldwork, ensure your research question is focused, your methods are justified, and your analysis critically examines the reliability and representativeness of your data. Demonstrate independence of thought by linking evidence to wider theory and suggesting realistic recommendations or avenues for further research.
