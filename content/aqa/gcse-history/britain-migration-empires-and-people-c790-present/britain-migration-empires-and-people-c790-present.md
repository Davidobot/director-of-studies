# Britain: Migration, Empires and the People c790–present (GCSE History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview and big ideas
This thematic study asks you to explore how the people of Britain have been shaped by interaction with the wider world from the age of the Vikings to the modern day. It covers invasion and settlement, trade and colonisation, the growth and retreat of empire, mass migration and the long-term consequences of these processes for British identity. Throughout the period you will be expected to think about cause and consequence, continuity and change, similarity and difference, and the significance of people and events. The specification emphasises the role of factors such as war, religion, government, economic resources, science and technology, and ideas about empire and civilisation. It also encourages you to assess the impact of key individuals—conquerors, traders, reformers and nationalists—while recognising broad structural forces like markets, industry and imperial rivalry.

## Chronology and the long sweep of change
The theme stretches over more than a thousand years, so it helps to see it as a series of overlapping phases rather than a single continuous story. The early phase (c790–1066) is dominated by Scandinavian migration and settlement alongside Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, the next phase (1066–c1500) by Norman conquest and the formation of a more centralised English state. From the early modern period Britain begins to look outward: exploration, plantation colonies and the transatlantic slave economy appear in the 16th and 17th centuries and then expand dramatically in the 18th and 19th centuries with the East India Company, the Scramble for Africa and imperial consolidation. The 20th century sees two world wars that weaken imperial control and stimulate anti-colonial movements; decolonisation after 1945 leads to new patterns of migration to Britain, especially from the Caribbean, South Asia and Africa. Each phase raises different questions about who came to Britain, why people left or were taken abroad, how the British state and society reacted, and how identities changed.

## Early migrations, conquest and settlement (c790–1500)
Migration to and within the British Isles long predates the modern era. Viking raids from c790 led to more sustained settlement in eastern and northern England, the creation of the Danelaw, and cultural exchanges that reshaped language, law and town development. The Norman invasion of 1066 introduced a new ruling elite, new military architecture and different systems of landholding and government. These events were not just military episodes; they affected population patterns, legal traditions and the nature of kingship. Medieval England also engaged in outward movement, for example through crusading and settlement in Ireland. The development of an English identity grew slowly, influenced by wars such as the Hundred Years’ War and by the mixing of peoples and customs over centuries.

## Trade, colonisation and empire in the early modern period (1500–1800)
By the 16th century Britain was becoming an outward-looking maritime power. Privateering and early colonising ventures, along with the growth of overseas trade in commodities such as sugar and tobacco, linked Britain increasingly to the Atlantic world. The development of the slave trade and plantation economies in the Caribbean generated huge profits for some and enormous suffering for millions. Figures such as John Hawkins and later merchants and planters were central to this expansion. In North America the founding of Jamestown and other colonies created patterns of settlement, dispossession of indigenous peoples and new economic structures. At the same time migration into Britain continued, with Huguenot refugees and the forced movement of people within the Empire and its colonies. The East India Company began to establish political control in India in the 18th century, turning commercial interests into territorial rule and setting the stage for much deeper influence in the 19th century.

## Imperial expansion, migration and the British public (1800–1914)
The nineteenth century is the age of high imperialism. Advances in naval power, transportation and industry helped Britain build an empire that covered vast territories. The Scramble for Africa, the consolidation of control in India after the rebellion of 1857, and interventions in places such as Egypt and South Africa altered the scale and meaning of British overseas involvement. Migration was multi-directional: thousands left Britain for settler colonies, while people moved within empire networks as administrators, soldiers, merchants and labourers. The Boer War exposed the costs of empire and provoked debate at home, and imperial propaganda helped shape ideas about race, civilisation and Britain’s supposed duty to rule. Economic motives, missionary fervour, scientific and technological confidence, and ideological beliefs about social Darwinism all played a part in driving expansion.

## Empire, decolonisation and post‑war migration (1914–present)
Two world wars transformed the relationship between Britain and its Empire. The wars mobilised colonial troops, disrupted imperial economies and raised questions about self-determination. After 1945 the process of decolonisation gathered pace; India’s independence in 1947 was followed by an accelerating wave of national liberation across Africa, the Caribbean and Asia. The political retreat of empire produced new migrations to Britain. The arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948 symbolised Caribbean migration to fill labour shortages in the post‑war welfare state. Asians from former colonies and displaced people from Africa also migrated, while the 1970s saw the expulsion of Asians from Uganda under Idi Amin and their resettlement in Britain. These movements transformed British society, contributing to multiculturalism but also provoking racial tensions, policy responses and new debates about citizenship, belonging and the meaning of British identity.

## Impacts on society, culture and identity
Migration and empire affected almost every aspect of life in Britain. Economically, empire created markets and sources of raw materials that helped fuel industrialisation, but it also involved exploitation and uneven development. Socially and culturally, migration brought new religions, cuisines, languages and cultural practices; the presence of Caribbean, South Asian and African communities has left a lasting imprint on British music, food and public life. Politically, imperial loss and new multicultural realities forced reassessment of citizenship, race relations and immigration law; events such as the Brixton Riots encouraged government inquiry and reform, while activists and organisations campaigned for civil rights. The legacy of empire is contested: for some it is a history of trade and cultural exchange, for others a history of violence, slavery and dispossession. A balanced revision approach recognises both continuities—such as enduring inequalities—and clear changes, for instance in legal rights and the visible diversity of modern Britain.

## Case studies that help bring the theme to life
Studying a few strong case studies makes this broad theme easier to remember and analyse. The Windrush generation illustrates post‑war migration, recruitment shortages in the NHS and public transport, and the long-term integration and discrimination experienced by Caribbean migrants. The Indian Rebellion of 1857 and subsequent Crown takeover reveal how commercial interests can become imperial rule and how rebellion can reshape imperial policy. The Boer War highlights the human and political costs of imperial expansion and the debates it provoked in Britain about tactics, morality and national self-image. The experience of Ugandan Asians in the 1970s offers a vivid example of forced migration, humanitarian response and the role of government policy in resettlement. Each case study allows you to trace causes, consequences and the role of individuals, while linking local experiences to wider global processes.

## Exam technique
When you answer exam questions on this topic, always connect facts to the second order concepts the specification emphasises. For change-over-time questions, start by setting out the situation at the beginning and end of the period, then explain the processes that produced those changes and where continuity remained. For significance questions, consider immediate impact and longer-term effects, and compare different aspects to justify your judgement. When asked to explain causes or consequences, distinguish between short- and long-term causes and between intentional and unintended consequences. For source evaluation questions, use the content of the source but also discuss provenance: who produced it, when and why, and how that affects its usefulness. For interpretation questions you will need to compare different viewpoints; explain why historians or contemporaries might disagree by referring to evidence, perspective and purpose, and then make a reasoned judgement about which interpretation you find more convincing. In essays aim for a clear line of argument and use specific examples—such as Windrush, the East India Company, the Scramble for Africa or the 1857 Rebellion—to support points. Keep an eye on timing so you allocate enough time to the highest-mark questions, and remember that marks are awarded not simply for knowledge but for analysis, explanation and the quality of written communication, including clear spelling, punctuation and grammar.
