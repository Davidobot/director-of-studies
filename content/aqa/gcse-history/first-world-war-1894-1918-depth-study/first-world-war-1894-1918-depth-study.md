# First World War 1894–1918 (wider world depth) (GCSE History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview and scope
This wider world depth study examines how and why the First World War broke out, the way it was fought, its turning points and why it proved so difficult to end. The focus is on the Great Powers and other states between the later nineteenth century and the armistice of November 1918, so students will connect long-term international developments with immediate causes and military events. Understanding this period requires attention to political aims and rivalries, the interaction of technology and tactics on the battlefield, and the human and social consequences both at the front and on the home fronts. The study also considers key individuals and decisions that shaped the conflict and how the war altered the map of Europe and the experience of millions across the globe.

## Long-term causes: alliances, imperial rivalry and nationalism
The background to the First World War lies in decades of shifting alliances, imperial competition and rising nationalism. By the 1890s Europe was divided into two hostile systems: the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy, and the growing network around France, Russia and, increasingly, Britain that came to be known as the Entente powers. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s ambition for Germany to be a major global power led to Weltpolitik, which increased competition abroad and contributed to an Anglo-German naval race. Imperial disputes such as the Moroccan Crises of 1905 and 1911 and colonial rivalries heightened mistrust between the powers. At the same time the Balkans were unstable: the decline of Ottoman authority encouraged nationalist movements, particularly among Slavs who looked to Serbia as a leader. These long-term stresses created an atmosphere where a local crisis could escalate into a general war.

## The July Crisis and the outbreak of war
The immediate cause of the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 by a Bosnian Serb nationalist. The assassination sparked the July Crisis, during which Austria-Hungary, with German support, issued an ultimatum to Serbia that contained demands designed to undermine Serbian sovereignty. When Serbia did not accept every demand, Austria-Hungary declared war. Russia mobilised in defence of Serbia, Germany supported Austria-Hungary and implemented the Schlieffen Plan, a pre-war strategy that aimed to knock France out quickly by sweeping through Belgium and then turn east against Russia. Germany’s invasion of neutral Belgium brought Britain into the war because treaties and public opinion committed Britain to Belgian neutrality. Within days the conflict spread into a European general war: alliances, mobilisations and plans acted like a fuse that turned a regional crisis into a continent-wide conflagration.

## The Western Front: trench warfare and stalemate
Germany’s advance was halted at the Battle of the Marne in September 1914, and the Western Front settled into a deadly stalemate of trench systems stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss border. The trenches, protected by barbed wire and defended by machine guns and artillery, produced a style of warfare dominated by attrition: both sides sought to wear down the enemy’s manpower and morale. Life in the trenches was physically and mentally exhausting, with soldiers facing mud, disease, rats and the constant threat of shellfire. The major battles of 1916–1917 illustrate the scale and character of this fighting. At Verdun the French and Germans engaged in a battle of attrition that cost both sides hundreds of thousands of casualties but produced limited strategic gain. The Battle of the Somme, launched by the British and French in 1916 to relieve Verdun and break German lines, is remembered for the enormous loss of life on the first day and the limited territorial gains achieved at great cost. Passchendaele in 1917 demonstrated how weather, artillery devastation and constrained movement could turn offensives into slogs through mud. These battles are central to understanding why the Western Front remained so deadly and why commanders often resorted to massed artillery and infantry despite the human cost.

## War beyond the Western Front: seas, colonies and other theatres
Although the Western Front is the most familiar scene, the war was global in scale. The naval war affected economic survival and strategic options. Germany’s use of unrestricted submarine warfare attempted to cut Britain’s sea lines of communication and commerce but also provoked international protest and diplomatic consequences. The introduction of the convoy system helped reduce losses from U-boats and was part of the wider effort to keep Britain supplied. The Battle of Jutland in 1916 was the largest naval battle and, while indecisive tactically, it confirmed British control of the seas. Campaigns in other theatres were important too. The Gallipoli campaign of 1915 aimed to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war and open a route to Russia, but it ended in evacuation and heavy Allied losses, affecting Turkish and Commonwealth morale and later national memories in places such as Australia and New Zealand. The Eastern Front was more fluid: the vast distances and different balance of forces produced large manoeuvres and high casualties, and colonial troops fought in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, spreading the war’s consequences across empires.

## Technology, medicine and the human cost
The First World War accelerated the introduction and lethal use of new military technologies. Machine guns and rapid-firing artillery dominated defensive tactics; poison gas introduced a new form of suffering and panic; tanks appeared late in 1916 as an attempt to restore mobility; aircraft were used first for reconnaissance and then for bombing and air combat. These innovations changed how battles were fought and increased the scale of slaughter. The human cost was immense: millions of soldiers were killed or wounded, and civilian populations suffered from food shortages, bombardments and displacement. At the same time medical practice made important advances in response to the scale of injuries. Developments in blood transfusion, surgical techniques, infection control and the organisation of casualty evacuation improved survival rates for many badly wounded soldiers. The war also changed societies: women moved into industries and roles previously reserved for men, accelerating social change and contributing to suffrage movements in several countries.

## 1917–1918: turning points, collapse and armistice
The years 1917 and 1918 brought decisive shifts. Russia’s military collapse and the Bolshevik Revolution removed a major Allied partner from the Eastern Front, freeing German forces for the west and creating political consequences across Europe. The diplomatic and economic strain on the Central Powers increased as the Allied blockade of Germany tightened shortages of food and raw materials. Crucially, the entry of the United States into the war in 1917 supplied fresh troops, resources and a boost to Allied morale; American economic ties and reactions to unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram helped precipitate that entry. In 1918 Germany launched the Spring Offensive under Ludendorff, achieving initial territorial gains but failing to secure a decisive victory. Exhausted and dealing with renewed Allied offensives—including the coordinated Allied advance during the Hundred Days and improved combined tactics under commanders such as Ferdinand Foch—the Central Powers began to collapse politically and militarily. Allied advances, naval blockade effects and internal unrest led to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II and the German request for an armistice. The fighting ended on 11 November 1918, but the war had already reshaped borders, governments and societies.

## Why the war proved difficult to end and its immediate consequences
The First World War proved so difficult to end because it involved total mobilisation of economies and peoples, deep-seated national aims, and new levels of lethality that made decisive breakthroughs costly. The alliance system meant that local victories could be short-lived unless political aims were fully met. Military stalemate required enormous resources to bend outcomes, while the humanitarian impact and the spread of revolution and unrest added to political instability. By the armistice of November 1918 the map of Europe had begun to be redrawn and empires had collapsed; millions were dead or wounded and civilian suffering from food shortages and disease continued. The immediate consequences included revolutions, new nation-states emerging in central and eastern Europe, and global social and economic disruption. These outcomes set the scene for the peace settlements that followed and for long-term international tensions in the inter-war period.

## Exam technique
When approaching exam questions on this topic, start by reading the question carefully and identifying the command words such as ‘explain’, ‘assess’, ‘describe’ or ‘how far’. For knowledge questions you must show clear factual detail: use named events, dates and individuals to support your points, and link them to the question focus. For causation and consequence questions, aim to show connections between short-term triggers and long-term structural causes and to explain why some factors were more important than others. For source questions remember to consider both content and provenance: what does the source actually say, whose viewpoint does it represent, why was it produced and how does your contextual knowledge support or challenge its usefulness. When asked to evaluate interpretations, compare the arguments, explain differences in emphasis or perspective, and then make a reasoned judgement supported by evidence.

Structure longer answers into clear paragraphs that each make a single point and support it with precise examples; a concluding paragraph that directly answers the question helps secure higher marks. For extended essays, plan a brief introduction that sets out your line of argument, develop balanced paragraphs that weigh different factors, and finish with a judgement that explains why your chosen argument fits the evidence best. Remember the assessment objectives: AO1 rewards accurate knowledge, AO2 rewards analysis of causes and consequences or change and continuity, AO3 rewards source evaluation, and AO4 rewards interpretation evaluation. Keep an eye on time so that you allocate time proportionately to the marks available and leave a few minutes to check spelling, punctuation and grammar, as high performance in these areas can add valuable marks. Finally, learn key examples in depth—such as the July Crisis, the Battles of the Somme and Verdun, Gallipoli, the U-boat campaign, the Russian Revolution and the 1918 offensives—so you can deploy them confidently to support analysis and judgement in any exam question.
