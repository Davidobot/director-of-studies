# America 1920–1973: Opportunity and inequality (GCSE History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: a nation of contrasts
Between 1920 and 1973 the United States experienced dramatic economic growth, social transformation and sustained conflict over who could share in the country’s prosperity. For many this period was the fulfilment of the “American Dream”: rising wages, mass consumer goods, suburbs, and advances in medicine and education. For others it was a time of exclusion and struggle: entrenched racial segregation in the South, discrimination against immigrants and minority groups, violent backlash from groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, and persistent poverty in parts of the country. Understanding this half-century means tracing how economic cycles, government policies, cultural change and grassroots movements combined to create both opportunity and inequality.

## The 1920s: boom, culture and division
The 1920s are often described as a decade of boom. Mass production, typified by Henry Ford’s assembly line, cut prices and put cars in millions of American driveways. New consumer industries—advertising, radio, cinema—created a mass culture and encouraged hire-purchase credit. Republican administrations favoured pro-business policies which supported economic expansion and a rising standard of living for many. Social change was visible in the figure of the flapper and in the growing independence of women after partial suffrage in 1920. Yet beneath the gloss were deep divisions. Prohibition (the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act) fuelled organised crime and was widely flouted. Immigration was restricted by laws of the 1920s, especially the 1924 Immigration Act, which reflected nativist fears. The Ku Klux Klan enjoyed a resurgence and racial tensions continued, while the Red Scare after World War I targeted radicals and immigrants. The Sacco and Vanzetti case in 1920 crystallised fears about immigrants, anarchism and justice.

## The Crash, the Depression and the New Deal
The Wall Street Crash of October 1929 marked the end of the boom and ushered in the Great Depression. Unemployment soared, many banks failed and farmers suffered from falling prices. President Herbert Hoover’s initial responses were limited by his belief in voluntary action and balanced budgets; by 1932 many voters blamed his administration for inaction. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s election in 1932 brought the New Deal, a series of federal programmes designed to provide relief, recovery and reform. Agencies such as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Social Security Act expanded government intervention in the economy and provided jobs, welfare and infrastructure. The New Deal stabilised banking through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and introduced regulations on the financial sector. It also provoked criticism from the Supreme Court, conservatives who argued it expanded federal power too far, and radicals who said it did not go far enough. Importantly, the New Deal had mixed effects on racial inequality: while some programmes helped Black Americans, many measures excluded agricultural and domestic workers—jobs dominated by African Americans—so the benefits were uneven.

## World War II and its transformative effects
World War II ended the Depression for the United States. Massive wartime spending, full employment and wartime production for allies under Lend-Lease and later direct involvement created an economic boom. Millions of men served in the armed forces and large numbers of women entered industry. The GI Bill after 1944 provided returning veterans with educational and housing benefits which fuelled suburban growth and a skilled workforce. The war also intensified contradictions in American life: the fight against fascism abroad highlighted racial segregation at home. The federal government made some moves to address discrimination—the 1941 Executive Order 8802 banned discriminatory practices in defence industries—but full legal equality remained elusive. The war’s end left the US as a global superpower, economically dominant and politically committed to containing communism, a stance that shaped the Cold War and domestic politics for decades.

## Post-war affluence, conformity and dissent
The 1950s saw unprecedented prosperity for many Americans. Rising real wages, expanding home ownership in Levittown-style suburbs, the growth of consumer credit and new technologies such as television helped create a broad middle class. The idea of the American Dream—home, car, consumer goods—became more widely attainable for white families. Yet this prosperity was not universal. African Americans, many inner-city residents and some rural communities lagged behind. The era also saw strong anti-communist politics. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and Senator Joseph McCarthy’s hearings fostered fear of subversion, leading to blacklisting and a stifling of dissent in parts of society. By the late 1950s and 1960s cultural shifts, youth rebellion and civil rights activism challenged the conformity of earlier years, revealing growing fractures beneath the surface prosperity.

## The Civil Rights movement: from legal victories to mass protest
The struggle for African American civil rights moved from legal challenges to mass protest and federal legislation between the 1950s and 1960s. The Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 declared school segregation unconstitutional and provided a legal basis for change. Grassroots campaigns produced major confrontations and victories: the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–56) led by Martin Luther King Jr. highlighted the power of non-violent protest; the Freedom Rides (1961), sit-ins and the Birmingham campaign (1963) exposed brutal resistance to desegregation and drew national attention. The March on Washington in 1963 symbolised broad support for change and King’s “I Have a Dream” speech became an iconic call for equality. Legislation followed: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed segregation in public places and employment discrimination; the Voting Rights Act of 1965 tackled barriers to black enfranchisement in the South. However, the movement was not monolithic. Figures such as Malcolm X and organisations that advocated Black Power from the mid-1960s argued for more confrontational and nationalist approaches, reflecting frustration at slow progress and economic inequality. Urban riots in the mid-to-late 1960s and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 revealed the depth of social tensions.

## The Great Society, feminism and the limits of reform
President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society built on New Deal ideas and the momentum of the civil rights movement to fight poverty and expand federal responsibility for social welfare. Major programmes included Medicare and Medicaid, reforms in education such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and anti-poverty measures like the Economic Opportunity Act and Head Start. These initiatives reduced some inequalities and expanded access to health care and education. At the same time, the 1960s saw the rise of the modern women’s movement. Organisations such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) campaigned for equal pay, access to employment and legal equality. Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972 and Title IX in 1972 prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded education, but the ERA ultimately failed to achieve the necessary state ratifications. A landmark judicial decision, Roe v. Wade in 1973, established a woman’s constitutional right to choose abortion, reshaping debates about reproductive rights. Despite legislative and judicial gains, many social inequalities persisted into the 1970s, and critiques argued that policies often failed to reach or fully transform the lives of the most disadvantaged.

## Continuity, change and who benefited
To make sense of 1920–1973 it helps to look at both continuity and change. Economic modernisation, mass media and federal intervention in the economy increased over the period, accelerating technological and social change. Yet patterns of inequality—based on race, gender, region and class—showed resilience. White, male, middle-class Americans gained disproportionally from suburbanisation, the GI Bill and consumer credit, while many African Americans and minorities faced structural barriers to housing, employment and political power until late into the 1960s and beyond. Government action—New Deal, wartime mobilisation, civil rights and Great Society legislation—was decisive in reshaping the state’s role and in providing tools for progress, but implementation and local resistance often limited the reach of reform. Evaluating “success” therefore requires examining who benefited, how policies were enforced, and the unintended consequences of reforms.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on America 1920–1973, always make sure you are explicit about dates, named people, laws and organisations to show precise knowledge. For causation questions, explain short-term triggers and longer-term structural causes and link them to consequences with clear examples (for instance, link the Wall Street Crash to bank failures and to Roosevelt’s New Deal programmes). For significance questions, judge the importance of an event by comparing it with alternatives and explain both immediate and lasting impacts (for example, weigh Brown v. Board of Education against later voting legislation). When using sources or interpretations, comment on content, provenance and context: who produced the source, why, and how that shapes its usefulness; when evaluating interpretations consider different historians’ perspectives and the evidence they emphasise. Use second-order concepts—cause, consequence, change, continuity, similarity and difference—to structure extended answers and show historical thinking. Write clear introductions and conclusions that set out and then sum up your argument, and where possible, integrate short, focused paragraphs that each make a single point supported by evidence. Finally, practise timing so you can plan responses, include balanced analysis, and leave time for a brief, polished conclusion that answers the question directly.
