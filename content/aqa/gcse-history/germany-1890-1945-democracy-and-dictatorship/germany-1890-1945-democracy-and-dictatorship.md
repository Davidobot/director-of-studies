# Germany 1890–1945: Democracy and dictatorship (GCSE History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview and chronology
Germany between 1890 and 1945 is a dramatic half-century in which long-term trends in politics, society and the economy collide with crisis and radical change. The period begins under Kaiser Wilhelm II, continues through defeat in the First World War and the fragile experiment of the Weimar Republic, and ends with the rise and fall of the Nazi dictatorship and the devastation of the Second World War. Understanding this topic requires attention to both long-term developments—industrialisation, social change and the legacy of Prussian militarism—and short-term triggers such as the economic shocks of 1923 and 1929–33. Chronologically, the period can be usefully divided into three parts: the growth of democracy and the collapse of the old order to 1924; the challenge of the Depression and the collapse of Weimar democracy in 1929–33; and the consolidation and consequences of Nazi rule from 1933 to 1945.

## From Kaiserreich to Weimar: causes of crisis, 1890–1924
The final decades of the German Empire under Kaiser Wilhelm II reveal tensions that later shaped Weimar politics. Rapid industrialisation produced economic dynamism and social change, but also social conflict, the growth of organised labour and political pressures for reform. Prussian militarism and conservative elites retained disproportionate influence, creating a constitutional system in which the Kaiser and the army often dominated decisions. The catastrophe of the First World War exposed weaknesses in leadership and resources, and the failure of wartime policies contributed to war-weariness, political radicalisation and eventually revolution in 1918. The abdication of the Kaiser led to the creation of the Weimar Republic, a democratic constitution with progressive features such as broad civil rights and proportional representation, but also built-in vulnerabilities, most notably Article 48 which allowed the president to suspend civil liberties in emergencies. The early years of Weimar were chaotic: civil wars and attempted coups (Spartacist rising, Kapp Putsch, Munich Putsch) demonstrated the fragility of democratic institutions, while economic disaster—especially hyperinflation in 1923 and the occupation of the Ruhr—undermined public confidence. The stabilisation that came with the introduction of the Rentenmark and international financial settlement under Gustav Stresemann (the Dawes Plan) brought a temporary breathing space and cultural dynamism, but did not remove deeper structural problems.

## The fragile recovery and the impact of the Depression, 1924–1933
The mid-to-late 1920s are often remembered as a period of relative recovery for Weimar Germany. Industrial output rose, foreign loans and investment flowed into the economy, and international reconciliation—symbolised by Germany joining the League of Nations and the Locarno Treaties—boosted confidence. Cultural life in cities like Berlin thrived, and many Germans experienced improved living standards. Yet this recovery depended on short-term American loans and an international economy that remained vulnerable. When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered a global depression, German unemployment soared, industry contracted sharply, and political extremism gained ground. The moderate parties struggled to form stable coalitions, and presidential rule under Hindenburg and successive chancellors increasingly relied on emergency decrees. The Nazi Party exploited economic distress, nationalist resentment about Versailles, fears of communism and effective propaganda and organisation to expand its support. Hitler’s refusal to enter a coalition as a junior partner, combined with backroom deals among conservative elites who believed they could control him, led to his appointment as Chancellor in January 1933.

## The Nazi seizure and consolidation of power, 1933–1934
Once in power Hitler and his supporters moved quickly to eliminate political opposition and reshape the state. The Reichstag Fire in February 1933 provided a pretext for the Reichstag Fire Decree which suspended civil liberties and allowed mass arrests of Communists and other opponents. The Enabling Act of March 1933 gave the government legislative powers without parliamentary consent, effectively ending parliamentary democracy. Through a process known as Gleichschaltung, the Nazi regime brought the Länder (regional governments), civil service, trade unions and professional organisations under central control, banned other parties, and purged institutions of opponents. The Night of the Long Knives in June 1934 removed the Sturmabteilung (SA) leadership and other rivals, consolidating the loyalty of the army and eliminating a potential source of internal threat. By August 1934, with President Hindenburg’s death and Hitler’s combining of the offices of Chancellor and President, the Nazi dictatorship was firmly established. The regime’s legal changes, use of emergency powers, and manipulation of institutions show how law and terror worked together to dismantle democracy.

## Life in Nazi Germany and the wartime impact, 1933–1945
The Nazi dictatorship sought not only political control but also social and cultural transformation. Economic policy combined public works, rearmament and later wartime mobilisation to reduce unemployment and prepare for expansion, while organisations such as the Deutsche Arbeitsfront replaced independent unions. Propaganda, led by Joseph Goebbels, permeated public life: rallies, radio broadcasts, film and the Hitler Youth shaped a uniform culture and glorified the regime’s ideals. Social policy aimed to create an Aryan Volksgemeinschaft, promoting traditional gender roles for women, extensive youth indoctrination, and staged public displays of unity. Racial policy became progressively more radical. The Nuremberg Laws institutionalised racial discrimination against Jews in 1935, and state-sponsored persecution escalated into violence such as Kristallnacht in 1938 and, during the war, the systematic mass murder known as the Final Solution. Repression was enforced by a security apparatus including the Gestapo, SS and concentration camps; dissent was dangerous but not absent—examples of resistance include the White Rose student group, clandestine opposition by some churches, workers’ protests, and attempts such as the July 1944 bomb plot. The Second World War intensified both the regime’s criminal policies and the strains on German society: bombing, labour shortages, rationing and refugee flows undermined morale, while occupation policies and the Holocaust left grim legacies that determined Germany’s defeat in 1945.

## Causes, interpretations and key debates
Students must be comfortable with interpretative questions about why Weimar failed and why the Nazis succeeded. Historians debate the relative importance of structural factors—such as the weaknesses built into the Weimar constitution, economic instability, and the legacy of militarism—and contingent causes such as the impact of the Great Depression, the role of individual actors (Hindenburg, Brüning, Papen, von Schleicher), and the strategic decisions by conservative elites who underestimated Hitler. There are competing explanations for popular support: economic distress certainly helped, but Nazi ability to appeal to different groups by promising order, jobs, and national revival was crucial. Equally important was the party’s organisation at local level, the effective use of modern propaganda, and the violence and intimidation of the SA which silenced rivals. For the nature of Nazi rule, debates centre on how monolithic the dictatorship was: while Hitler and the Party set aims, policy often emerged from competition between state agencies, the SS, and private firms; intentionalist and structuralist interpretations offer different accounts of the origins and driver of radical racial policy. When answering questions, students should recognise complexity: few single causes suffice, and different social groups experienced the period in very different ways.

## What to remember: key facts and examples
A clear timeline and a set of well-chosen examples help answers stand out. Key turning points include 1918–19 (revolution and Treaty of Versailles), 1923 (hyperinflation and Ruhr crisis), 1924–29 (Stresemann era and relative stability), 1929–33 (depression and political collapse), January–March 1933 (Hitler’s appointment and the Enabling Act), June 1934 (Night of the Long Knives), 1935–38 (Nuremberg Laws and Kristallnacht), and 1939–45 (war and genocide). Important names to link to events include Kaiser Wilhelm II (pre-1918), Ebert and the Weimar coalition leaders (1918–23), Stresemann (stabilisation), Hindenburg (presidential power), Brüning, Papen and von Schleicher (political crises), Hitler (rise and dictatorship), Goebbels (propaganda), Himmler (SS), and figures of resistance such as the White Rose members Sophie and Hans Scholl. Use specific examples in answers: the Dawes Plan and foreign loans in the mid-1920s, the use of Article 48 in the early 1930s, the Reichstag Fire Decree, the Enabling Act’s legal wording, and the organisation of the Hitler Youth and Nazi labour schemes.

## Exam technique
Approach each question with the assessment objective in mind: AO1 rewards accurate knowledge and clear factual detail; AO2 looks for explanation and analysis using second-order concepts such as cause, consequence, continuity and change; AO3 requires careful use of sources (content and provenance) to support judgements; AO4 assesses evaluation of interpretations and the ability to reach a reasoned judgement. In Paper 1 Section A (period study) you will face short interpretation questions and a longer essay. When you analyse interpretations, begin by summarising each view succinctly, then use contextual knowledge to explain why they differ—consider author, purpose and the evidence available to them—and finally judge how convincing each is, using your own knowledge to support your view. For describe or explain questions, use specific facts and link them to the focus of the question: avoid narrative that drifts from the question. For change questions, identify the factor named in the question, explain its impact, and compare it with other factors to show balance.

When handling source questions in Section B (wider world depth studies) treat provenance as part of your evaluation: consider who produced the source, when and why, and whether that affects reliability or usefulness. Use the source’s content as a springboard for your own knowledge—do not rely solely on the source. For usefulness questions, discuss both strengths (what the source reveals that is valuable) and limitations (what it omits or distorts), always supporting points with precise contextual facts. For narrative 'write an account' questions, structure your answer chronologically and link events to causes or consequences.

Extended essays should have a clear introduction that outlines how you will answer the question, a series of analytical paragraphs each focused on one reason or factor with evidence, and a conclusion that brings together the arguments and makes a judgement. Use signposting language to clarify your argument and ensure each paragraph answers the question. Time management is essential in the two-hour papers: allocate time first to the shorter source and interpretation questions so you secure those marks, and then concentrate remaining time on planning and writing your extended answers.

Finally, aim for clarity and accuracy in spelling, punctuation and grammar. Use relevant historical terms correctly and keep sentences clear and direct. Practice writing answers under timed conditions, annotate model responses to recognise strong structure, and revise a set of reliable examples you can deploy in answers: accurate dates, names, legislation, and short case studies make responses persuasive and precise.
