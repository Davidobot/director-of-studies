# Cold War 1945–1972: Conflict and tension (GCSE History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview and origins of the Cold War
The Cold War was a prolonged period of political, military and ideological rivalry between the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies on one side, and the United States and its Western allies on the other. It began as the Second World War ended and lasted into the 1970s and beyond. At the heart of the confrontation were deep disagreements about the future shape of Europe and the world. The wartime alliance between the USSR, the USA and Britain was fragile: wartime co-operation masked incompatible aims. The Soviet leadership sought security for the USSR after the enormous human and material losses of the war and wanted friendly or compliant governments on its western borders. The United States and Britain, while initially tolerant of Soviet influence in the short term, grew alarmed at the spread of communist parties and Soviet control in Eastern Europe and developed policies intended to contain Soviet power. These conflicting aims were visible at the conferences of 1945: Yalta and Potsdam revealed differences over the division of Germany, reparations, and the fate of liberated countries. By 1947 the emerging rivalry had become institutionalised through policy: the Truman Doctrine’s promise to support states resisting communism and the Marshall Plan to rebuild European economies were read in Moscow as attempts to exclude the USSR from influence in Europe. In response, the Soviets tightened control behind what Churchill famously called the “Iron Curtain”, creating a clear East–West division.

## 1947–1953: Consolidation, containment and first confrontations
The first years of the Cold War saw institutions and allegiances take shape and the first major crises. The Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine signalled a long-term American commitment to European recovery and political stability. In reaction, the Soviet Union established Cominform to co-ordinate communist parties and Comecon to organise economic cooperation within the Soviet bloc. Germany became an immediate flashpoint. The currency reform in the Western zones and the introduction of the Deutschmark prompted the Soviet blockade of West Berlin in 1948–49; the Western powers responded with the Berlin Airlift, supplying the city by air for almost a year and making the division of Germany permanent. In 1949 the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) formalised Western military cooperation; the same year saw the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in the West and the German Democratic Republic in the East. The communist victory in China in 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 confirmed that Cold War competition was global rather than solely European. The Korean War, fought between North and South Korea with Chinese and UN (mainly US) involvement, hardened attitudes, increased military spending and reinforced the logic of containment. By 1953, with Stalin’s death and an exhausted Korea stalemate, both sides had clear patterns of alliances, spheres of influence and an emerging arms race.

## 1954–1962: Crises, reversals and the height of tension
The mid‑1950s to the early 1960s were marked by dramatic episodes that revealed both the risks of direct confrontation and the limits of superpower control. The Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956 showed the Kremlin’s determination to maintain its empire in Eastern Europe, while the Suez Crisis the same year illustrated the waning power of Britain and France and demonstrated how regional conflicts could complicate superpower relations. Technological competition intensified the rivalry: the launch of Sputnik in 1957 inaugurated the space race and sharpened fears in the West about missile and technological capabilities. The U-2 spy plane incident in 1960, when an American spy plane was shot down over the USSR, derailed a major summit and publicly humiliated the United States. Berlin remained a key symbol of division. The flow of refugees from East to West through Berlin created a pressure that led the East German government, with Soviet support, to close the border and build the Berlin Wall in 1961. The most dangerous confrontation came in October 1962 when the discovery of Soviet ballistic missiles in Cuba triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis. For thirteen days the world teetered on the edge of nuclear war before Khrushchev and Kennedy reached a negotiated settlement: the Soviets withdrew the missiles from Cuba in return for a U.S. public pledge not to invade Cuba and, secretly, the withdrawal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. The crisis underlined the reality of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) and pushed both sides to consider better crisis management.

## 1963–1972: Stalemate, protests and the beginnings of détente
After the Cuban Missile Crisis both superpowers took steps to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear war and to stabilise relations. The establishment of a direct Moscow–Washington hotline and the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 reflected a shared interest in managing the rivalry. Yet competition continued in many forms. The Vietnam War became the central theatre of Cold War conflict in the 1960s and early 1970s: North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, supported by the USSR and China, fought against the US-backed South Vietnamese government, turning Cold War rivalry into a prolonged and costly guerrilla and counter‑insurgency war. In Europe, events such as the Prague Spring of 1968—an attempt by Alexander Dubček to create “socialism with a human face”—ended when Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion prompted the articulation of the Brezhnev Doctrine, declaring the Soviet right to intervene in socialist states to preserve communist rule. By the late 1960s and into the early 1970s, however, a pragmatic mood took hold in both Washington and Moscow. The United States, exhausted by Vietnam and domestic turmoil, and the Soviet leadership, seeking stability and international recognition, began limited rapprochement. President Nixon’s visits, increased diplomatic contacts, and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I), culminating in agreements in 1972, signalled the beginning of détente: a cautious easing of tensions based on negotiated limits rather than ideological victory.

## Ideology, strategy and the global impact
Ideology provided a powerful language for the Cold War but the underlying motives were often pragmatic. Soviet leaders emphasised security and the building of buffer states; they also promoted Marxist–Leninist revolution and supported communist parties and liberation movements, sometimes seeking influence more than direct control. The United States prioritised containment of communism, support for market economies and political pluralism where possible; American policy combined moral rhetoric with strategic concerns about access, influence and routes for trade. The competition produced a world of proxy wars, where superpowers supported rival governments, insurgencies or regimes far from Europe. Korea and Vietnam are the clearest examples, but Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia also experienced interventions, covert actions and economic pressure. The arms race drained resources, affected domestic economies and changed military planning. Nuclear weapons and delivery systems, from strategic bombers to intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched missiles, made the Cold War uniquely dangerous. At the same time cultural diplomacy, propaganda and economic aid were tools used to win hearts and minds: information campaigns, cultural exchanges, sporting events and foreign aid shaped perceptions and allegiances across the globe.

## The experience of people and the role of leaders
For ordinary people, the Cold War could feel both distant and immediate. In Western Europe and North America civil defence drills, fallout shelters and the constant presence of news about crises made nuclear danger part of life. In Eastern Europe political control, censorship, and limited travel created very different everyday realities. Leaders played outsized roles. Stalin’s post-war policies and the wartime alliances set the initial pattern of division. Truman’s containment policy and Marshall Plan shaped Western strategy. Khrushchev’s provocative rhetoric and willingness to take bold steps alternated with attempts at peaceful coexistence. Kennedy’s leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis is often credited with steering a peaceful resolution under enormous pressure, while Nixon and Brezhnev’s détente reflected a pragmatic desire to limit confrontation. Local leaders also mattered: Castro in Cuba brought the Cold War to America’s doorstep; Mao’s China added a powerful, independent communist actor; decolonisation created new states whose alignment or non-alignment could shift the balance of influence. Historical interpretation differs about responsibility: some historians stress Soviet expansionism and ideological aggression, others emphasise Western encirclement and the security dilemmas generated by competing alliances. Both sides interpreted the same actions through their own fears and experiences, feeding a cycle of mistrust.

## Why the Cold War proved difficult to resolve
Several features made the conflict resistant to easy resolution. First, the ideological divide was not just political rhetoric; both systems required different arrangements of power and society, which made compromise difficult. Second, security dilemmas and the memory of wartime suffering made concession seem risky. Third, the structure of alliances locked states into spheres of influence where any shift might be perceived as weakness. Fourth, nationalism and decolonisation created new flashpoints that intersected with superpower rivalry. Finally, the development of nuclear weapons transformed the logic of war: direct confrontation risked mutually assured destruction, so competition moved into more complicated, indirect forms—political pressure, economic competition, intelligence operations and proxy wars—rather than straightforward military victory.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the Cold War always start by making sure you understand the task and which assessment objectives are being targeted. For questions that ask you to explain causes or consequences, use precise knowledge to build a clear chain of reasoning: identify the factor, explain how it operated, and show why it mattered compared with other factors. When you are asked to evaluate sources or interpretations, remember to use content, provenance and context. Explain what the source says, consider who produced it and why, and assess how far it is useful or convincing given what you know. Don’t treat provenance as an extra paragraph of opinion; integrate it to show how the origin of a source affects its reliability or perspective. For interpretation questions, compare the interpretations directly and use your own knowledge to judge which is more credible and why; avoid simply agreeing or disagreeing without evidence. In essay questions plan a short structure before you start: a brief introduction that sets out the argument, two or three focused paragraphs each analysing a different factor with specific evidence and analysis, and a conclusion that reaches a balanced judgement. Use second‑order historical concepts like causation, consequence, continuity and change, and significance to organise analysis and to show deeper understanding. Time management is vital: allocate time to read sources, plan answers and check your writing. Finally, quality of written communication counts: write clearly, use specialist terms (for example containment, détente, MAD, Warsaw Pact) accurately, and aim for coherent sentences and paragraphs; this will help secure the SPaG marks as well as make your argument persuasive.
