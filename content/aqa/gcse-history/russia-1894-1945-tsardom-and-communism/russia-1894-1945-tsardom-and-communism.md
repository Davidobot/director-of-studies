# Russia 1894–1945: Tsardom and communism (GCSE History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: from autocracy to total war and totalitarianism
The period 1894–1945 in Russia takes you from the last years of the Romanov autocracy through revolution, civil war, the creation of the Soviet state and its transformation under Joseph Stalin, to the unparalleled trauma of the Second World War. It is a story of dramatic political change, rapid social and economic upheaval, and intense debate about ideas: about monarchy and reform, about socialism and dictatorship, about modernisation and human cost. Key themes for revision are continuity and change in government and society, the reasons for revolutionary success and failure, the role of leaders and ideas, and the consequences for ordinary people. Understanding the sequence of events is important, but it is equally important to explain why things happened, to weigh different interpretations and to evaluate contemporary sources.

## The end of Tsardom: society, 1905 and the First World War
At the end of the nineteenth century Russia remained a largely agrarian empire ruled by Tsar Nicholas II, whose conservative court and commitment to autocracy clashed with pressures for change. Industrialisation produced rapid but uneven growth in cities such as St Petersburg and Moscow, creating a growing urban working class who lived in overcrowded, unhealthy conditions. The countryside was dominated by peasants working land allocated under the emancipation reforms of the 1860s. Political opposition took many forms: liberal reformers, socialists (Mensheviks and Bolsheviks), and nationalist and peasant unrest. The 1905 Revolution, triggered by defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the Bloody Sunday massacre, forced Nicholas II to promise reforms in the October Manifesto and to create a Duma (parliament). In practice the Tsar continued to limit political change and reactionary forces, such as the minister Stolypin, used both reforms (land measures to strengthen the peasantry) and repression (executions and exile) to stabilise the regime. The First World War exposed deep weaknesses: military defeats, economic breakdown, food shortages and the alienation of soldiers and workers. The strain of war, together with the unpopularity of figures close to the court like Rasputin, led to the February 1917 uprising and the abdication of the Tsar. This collapse shows how long-term structural problems and short-term crises combined to end autocracy.

## 1917–1924: Revolution, civil war and Lenin’s government
1917 is central to this period. After the February revolution a Provisional Government tried to continue the war, frustrate land reform and manage a fragile coalition, but it lacked authority. The Bolsheviks, led by Lenin and aided by Trotsky’s organisational skill, promised “peace, land and bread” and seized power in the October Revolution. The Bolshevik seizure did not end opposition: the Civil War (1918–1921) pitted the Red Army against a loose collection of Whites, regional nationalists and foreign intervention. The Bolsheviks won by combining discipline and organisation, control of key central areas, and ruthless use of force. Wartime conditions produced the policy of War Communism: the requisitioning of grain, nationalisation of industry and strict labour control. War Communism helped the Bolsheviks win the war but provoked economic collapse and peasant revolts such as Kronstadt in 1921. In response, Lenin introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP), a partial retreat that allowed small-scale private trade and agriculture, stabilised the economy, and reassured many who feared Bolshevik radicalism. Underneath these policies lay the Bolshevik aim to transform society: to abolish the old elites, to create new soviet organs, and to base power in the Communist Party. By 1924 Lenin’s death opened the question of succession and the nature of the post-revolutionary state.

## 1924–1929: Power struggles and the road to Stalinism
The years after Lenin’s death saw factional struggle inside the Communist Party. Trotsky, a brilliant organiser and commander of the Red Army, promoted permanent revolution and rapid industrialisation; Stalin, who controlled key party structures, advocated “socialism in one country” and gradually consolidated power by building alliances within the party apparatus. Between 1924 and 1929 Stalin outmaneuvered rivals through a combination of bureaucratic control, political alliances and ruthless elimination of opponents. The struggle ended with Trotsky’s marginalisation, exile and eventual assassination years later. These years are crucial to understand why the Soviet Union moved from the collective leadership Lenin had envisaged toward a highly centralised system under one man. The reversal from NEP toward forced industrialisation and collectivisation after 1928 marked the concrete policy break that historians often use to signal the arrival of Stalinism.

## 1928–1939: Collectivisation, Five Year Plans and transformation
Stalin launched the first Five Year Plan in 1928 with the aim of rapid industrialisation to catch up with the West and to secure military strength. The state directed investments into heavy industry, transport and armaments, setting ambitious production targets. Collectivisation of agriculture sought to consolidate small peasant holdings into large collective farms (kolkhozes) and state farms (sovkhozes). Collectivisation was driven by ideological motives and by economic needs: to extract grain for urban workers and to finance industrialisation through grain exports. The human cost was enormous. Forced requisitions, resistance by wealthier peasants labelled “kulaks,” deportations and famines—most disastrously in Ukraine in 1932–33—led to millions of deaths and long-term social disruption. Urban industrialisation produced dramatic increases in output in some sectors and transformed cities; it also involved harsh labour discipline, poor consumer provision, and a culture of intense state planning. By the late 1930s the USSR had the industrial base and arms production that would be decisive in the next war, but the social fabric had been remade through coercion as much as through progress.

## The Great Terror and everyday life: repression, propaganda and culture
The 1930s under Stalin were defined by the mobilisation of the state into every aspect of life. The Great Terror (1936–38) eliminated large numbers of party cadres, military officers, intellectuals and ordinary citizens through show trials, executions and gulag sentences. Institutions of surveillance and repression—the NKVD, show trials, purges—created a climate of fear in which denunciations and forced confessions were common. At the same time the state invested heavily in propaganda: a cult of personality around Stalin, strict control of education and the arts, and mass organisations that sought to remake values and loyalties. Everyday life was shaped by shortages of housing, consumer goods and food, by the demands of industrial labour, and by new opportunities such as education and a wider role for many women in work. Cultural life became instrumentalised: socialist realism in literature and art celebrated Soviet achievements while independent voices were silenced. The net result was a society that experienced both modernisation and extreme repression.

## The USSR and the Second World War: the Great Patriotic War, 1941–1945
The Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 and the subsequent territorial adjustments temporarily shielded the USSR from direct conflict, but Hitler’s invasion in June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa) plunged the country into a brutal struggle. The Great Patriotic War saw massive civilian and military casualties; cities such as Leningrad endured sieges, and entire regions were devastated. Stalin’s leadership during the war combined ruthless discipline with the mobilisation of patriotism; the wartime alliance with Britain and the USA brought material assistance but also complex diplomacy. Military improvements, the enormous human resource of mobilised industry relocated east of the Urals, and grim determination turned the tide by 1943, culminating in the capture of Berlin in 1945. The war’s impact was transformative: it cemented Soviet control over Eastern Europe, elevated the USSR as a superpower, and inflicted demographic and material losses that shaped domestic policy for decades. The way the state remembered and used the war also reinforced centralised power and the narrative of heroic sacrifice.

## Interpreting the period: debates and what matters for assessment
Students should be ready to engage with different historical interpretations. Historians debate, for example, why the Bolsheviks succeeded: was it their party organisation, the failures of the Provisional Government, the appeal of slogans like peace and land, or the role of individual leaders? Similarly, Stalin’s legacy invites competing views: some argue he modernised the Soviet Union and prepared it to defeat Nazism; others emphasise the immense human cost, the destruction of independent institutions and the moral consequences of terror. When answering interpretation questions, consider provenance (who wrote the interpretation and when), the evidence it uses, and what it omits. For causation essays weigh short-term triggers against long-term underlying causes and remember to assess significance—why an event mattered at the time and for the future. For source work, combine what the source says (content) with what it cannot tell you and explain how useful it is for a specific enquiry. Always link evidence back to the question and show awareness of broader context.

## Exam technique
Begin answers by making a clear, focused point that directly addresses the question; in essays sketch a brief plan before you write. For AO1 (knowledge) ensure facts are precise—names, dates, events—and use them to support explanations rather than as a list. For AO2 (explanation and second-order concepts) structure paragraphs around reasons, consequences, continuity or change, and explicitly use these terms when relevant. For AO3 (sources), evaluate usefulness by combining content with provenance: who created the source, when and why, and how that affects reliability; always support judgements with contextual knowledge and explain what additional evidence would help. For AO4 (interpretations), compare views, explain why historians differ, and assess the strength of arguments using evidence. In all answers, aim for balanced argument, consider counter-arguments, and reach a reasoned judgement. For extended questions, use a clear introduction that sets out the line of argument and a conclusion that directly answers the question. Manage time so that you leave longer on higher-mark questions and reserve a few minutes to proofread for spelling, punctuation and grammar; clear expression gains SPaG marks. Practise writing under timed conditions, use precise vocabulary (for example, “collectivisation,” “NEP,” “Great Terror”), and when practising source work, always link your analysis back to the question to show relevance.
