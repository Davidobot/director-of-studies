# Norman England c1066–c1100 (British depth & historic environment) (GCSE History Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: conquest, change and continuity
The Norman Conquest of 1066 and the decades that followed transformed England’s political structure, landholding, church and built environment, but it also produced continuities in everyday life and local institutions. The arrival of William of Normandy after the death of Edward the Confessor brought a new ruling elite and fresh ideas about monarchy and lordship. At the same time, many aspects of English village life, farming practices and legal customs persisted. This depth study asks you to understand how and why the Normans established control, how they reorganised land and government, how the Church and monastic life were reshaped, and how the material remains of the period — castles, cathedrals, towns and the entries in Domesday Book — help historians reconstruct the era. You will also study one specified historic site in depth and be expected to explain how a place illuminates wider developments in the period c.1066–c.1100.

## Causes and the military events of 1066–1070
The immediate cause of the Conquest was the disputed succession after Edward the Confessor’s death in January 1066. Several men claimed the throne, most importantly Harold Godwinson, who was crowned king, and William, Duke of Normandy, who asserted that Edward had promised him the crown and that Harold had sworn to support his claim. Harold’s unexpected defeat of an invading Norwegian force at Stamford Bridge on 25 September 1066 left his army weakened. William’s invasion that autumn culminated at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October, where the Norman combination of cavalry, archers and infantry defeated the English shield-wall. The exact circumstances of Harold’s death and the finer tactical details are debated by historians, but the result was decisive: the Norman claim to the throne was enforced militarily and politically. In the years that followed, William faced rebellions across England, including in the north where resistance in 1069–70 provoked his brutal campaign known as the Harrying of the North, and sporadic uprisings as late as the 1070s. These military events were crucial in establishing Norman dominance and demonstrating how military force, fortified sites and punitive measures could be used to consolidate rule.

## Castles, tactics and the new military order
One of the most visible changes after 1066 was the rapid building of castles. Motte-and-bailey fortifications appeared across the country because they were relatively quick to erect, provided a military base for Norman garrisons and symbolised lordly power in the landscape. Later, important strongholds were rebuilt in stone to provide permanent royal presence and to protect key routes and towns. Castles were not just defensive structures; they were administrative centres, prisons and visible statements of Norman authority. Normans also emphasised mounted cavalry and professional troops, which altered the balance of military power compared with Anglo-Saxon reliance on infantry fyrds and the housecarls. The combination of castle-building, a standing force of knights and a new network of castles across England helped to deter rebellion, control territory and support the imposition of Norman rule.

## Government, landholding and the Domesday survey
Norman rule reorganised landholding and government in ways that both adapted existing Anglo-Saxon systems and introduced new structures of feudal obligation. William claimed ownership of all land, granting estates to his followers in return for military service. This redistribution replaced much of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy with Norman tenants-in-chief and their under-tenants, producing social and political upheaval but also a clearer chain of lordship from king to vassal. The Domesday Book of 1086 stands as the most important administrative record from the period. Compiled as a survey of landholding and resources, Domesday provided the crown with information to assess taxes, feudal rights and obligations; it reveals patterns of land distribution, the extent of agricultural resources and the economic impact of conquest. Alongside written records, the growth of royal writs, the continuing role of shires and shire-reeves (sheriffs) and adaptations to the legal system — such as the enforcement of murdrum fines for the murder of a Norman lord — show how the Normans combined continuity in local administration with centralising royal authority.

## Society, economy and everyday life under Norman rule
For most people in villages and towns continuity predominated: peasant farmers continued to work the land, seasonal rhythms of sowing and harvest persisted, and craft production kept local markets going. Nevertheless, the Conquest brought economic and social consequences. The redistribution of land changed who collected rents and imposed obligations. The imposition of forest law confined access to large tracts of woodland for royal hunting, restricting local rights and sometimes provoking resentment. The construction and expansion of towns and markets under Norman lords encouraged trade, and the presence of Norman administrators and clergy increased demand for services. The social landscape also altered because of the arrival of Norman elites and occasionally settlers from Normandy and beyond, while some English nobles retained status by cooperating with the new regime. The impact of the Harrying of the North, recorded as devastation in Domesday, reminds us that conquest could produce famine, depopulation and severe economic disruption in particular regions.

## The Norman Church, monastic reform and culture
The Normans brought religious reform that reshaped the English Church’s leadership, architecture and intellectual life. Many Anglo-Saxon bishops and abbots were replaced by Norman clerics, and church appointments increasingly reflected the new political order. Lanfranc, appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, was central to reforming ecclesiastical discipline and reinforcing the authority of the Church as aligned with royal interests. Monastic reform, influenced by continental movements such as Cluniac monasticism, led to the founding and rebuilding of abbeys and cathedrals in the Romanesque style, with larger stone churches replacing many timber or earlier stone structures. Latin remained the language of administration and learning, but vernacular English continued among the population. The Church also became a major landholder and a partner in governance; disputes over investiture and episcopal authority foreshadowed tensions between crown and Church that would persist beyond this period.

## Studying the historic environment: what examiners expect
The historic environment study asks you to investigate a specific site in its historical context and to use physical evidence alongside written sources to explain connections between place and broader developments. Whether your site is a castle, cathedral, abbey, town or other landscape feature, approach it by considering its location, function and structure; the people connected with it; how design and materials reflect resources, technology and values; and how the site relates to major events or administrative arrangements of the period. For example, a motte-and-bailey castle can be interpreted as a military response to insecurity, a tool for local administration and a symbol of Norman lordship; a cathedral project tells you about ecclesiastical reform, wealth, patronage and evolving architectural techniques. Use Domesday entries, chronicles such as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or William of Poitiers, and archaeological evidence together to build a rounded interpretation. Examiners will reward answers that link features of the site to second-order historical concepts such as causation, continuity and change, and that evaluate how representative the site is of wider patterns in Norman England.

## Exam technique
Achieving high marks in this depth study depends on combining accurate factual knowledge with analytical skills and careful use of sources. For source-based questions, always read the item closely and relate it to your contextual knowledge; assess its usefulness by considering both content and provenance and by explaining how the source helps to answer the specific question. When asked to evaluate interpretations, identify the historian’s claim, explain why different interpretations might exist (different evidence, perspectives or later political views) and then use detailed knowledge to agree, disagree or qualify the interpretation. For essay questions allocate time to plan a clear line of argument: start with a concise thesis that answers the question, organise paragraphs around clear points supported by specific evidence, and conclude by summing up the argument and its implications for the question asked. In the historic environment question make sure you describe the site’s key features and then connect those features to wider developments such as governance, military control, ecclesiastical reform or economic change. Use the language of second-order concepts — cause, consequence, continuity, change and significance — to structure your analysis. Manage your time so longer questions receive the rewards of developed argument and precise examples, and remember that clear expression, accurate spelling and careful punctuation contribute to the highest marks. Practise writing balanced answers that use both archaeological/building evidence and documentary sources, and review examiner reports and mark schemes to understand how to balance description with analysis in order to reach top-level responses.
