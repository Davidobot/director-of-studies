# Nature of knowledge (justified true belief & Gettier) (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What philosophers mean by ‘knowledge’
When philosophers ask "What is knowledge?" they are usually concerned with knowledge-that: propositional knowledge expressed by sentences such as "S knows that p." It is useful to distinguish three everyday senses of "knowing." Acquaintance knowledge is direct experiential contact with something (knowing a person or a place), ability knowledge is know-how (knowing how to ride a bicycle), and propositional knowledge is knowledge-that (knowing that Paris is the capital of France). A-level epistemology focuses on propositional knowledge and the standards by which a belief counts as knowledge rather than mere true opinion or lucky guess. To make progress we therefore need a definition of knowledge that picks out what is special about the transition from believing something true to actually knowing it.

## The classical tripartite analysis: justified true belief
The classical answer, often traced to the spirit of Plato's dialogues and widely accepted in modern analytic philosophy until the 1960s, is the tripartite account: S knows that p if and only if (i) p is true, (ii) S believes that p, and (iii) S is justified in believing that p. Each condition plays a role. Truth distinguishes knowledge from false beliefs; belief distinguishes knowledge from accidental facts that a person does not assent to; justification separates knowledge from lucky true belief. "Justification" itself admits a variety of readings. Internalist readings require that the believer has access to reasons or evidence; externalist readings allow that factors outside a subject’s awareness—such as the reliability of the cognitive process—can provide justification.

Explaining these distinctions carefully is crucial in essays. Make clear what you mean by "justified": whether you are using a traditional evidentialist idea (supporting reasons available to the subject) or an externalist idea such as reliable processes producing true beliefs.

## Gettier’s challenge: lucky true belief
Edmund Gettier’s short 1963 paper changed the debate by offering cases in which all three conditions of justified true belief (JTB) are met, yet our intuition resists calling the belief knowledge. His cases are intentionally simple. In one, Smith has excellent evidence that Jones will get a job and that Jones has ten coins in his pocket; from this Smith justifiably infers the proposition "the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket." Unknown to Smith, Jones will not get the job but Smith will, and Smith happens to have ten coins in his own pocket. The proposition inferred turns out to be true, Smith believes it, and he was justified in holding it, yet the truth of his belief seems to rest on luck rather than on his justification.

Gettier-style examples show that JTB can come apart from what we want for knowledge because the belief's truth can be coincidental or epistemically luck-driven. The central philosophical issue is therefore how to exclude lucky true beliefs while retaining ordinary cases of knowledge.

## Responses to Gettier: supplementing or replacing JTB
Philosophers have proposed several strategies to repair the tripartite account. One straightforward move is to add a further condition to rule out the luck component. The "no false lemmas" solution turns JTB into JTB+N: knowledge is justified true belief that is not inferred from any falsehood. In some Gettier cases this works well, because the subject’s chain of reasoning involved a false assumption. But philosophers quickly produced new cases where the subject’s belief is true and justified without any identifiable false lemma, showing that no false lemmas is not a definitive fix.

Another strategy is to strengthen the justification condition to require it be infallible: if you are justified only when your justification guarantees truth, then Gettier-style luck is excluded. This "infallibilist" move, however, makes knowledge too strong: it excludes ordinary empirical knowledge because our justifications for everyday beliefs rarely guarantee truth in all possible circumstances.

A more radical reply abandons "justified" for an externalist condition. Reliabilism defines knowledge as true belief formed by a reliable cognitive process. If your belief that p is produced by a method that reliably yields true beliefs, then you know that p. Reliabilism deals neatly with many Gettier cases by focusing on the causal or statistical reliability of the formation process. Difficulties remain: what counts as a suitably specified process (the generality problem), and how to handle cases where a reliable process yields a true belief by sheer luck.

Virtue epistemology shifts attention from processes to agents. On this view, inspired by the work of philosophers such as Ernest Sosa and Linda Zagzebski, knowledge is true belief attributable to an agent’s intellectual virtues—skills, competences, and responsible inquiry. Knowledge is an achievement: a true belief formed through intellectual character. This approach captures the idea that knowing requires abilities or virtues rather than mere luck, but it raises hard questions about how to identify virtues and how to distinguish skillful from lucky success.

Finally, safety and sensitivity conditions offer modal ways of blocking Gettier luck. Sensitivity requires that if p were false the subject would not believe p; safety requires that in nearby possible worlds the subject would not easily form the false belief. These ideas, associated with Robert Nozick and others, can block some Gettier cases but face their own puzzles (for example, problems with logical closure and counterexamples such as the "fake barn" cases where sensitivity and safety give counterintuitive verdicts).

## Clarifying ‘justification’: internalism vs externalism and epistemic luck
A recurring theme in responses is the internalist–externalist divide about justification. Internalists insist that justification depends on factors accessible to the thinker—reasons, evidence, or reasons one could reflect on. Externalists argue that justification can be provided by factors like reliability that need not be accessible to the subject. Gettier cases are especially problematic for internalists because a subject can have all the internally accessible evidence yet still lack knowledge if luck intervenes. Externalists claim that by focusing on objective features of belief formation we can exclude Gettier luck.

Connected to these debates is the concept of epistemic luck: when a belief is true merely by accident in ways that make justification irrelevant. The central project of post‑Gettier epistemology is to characterise knowledge by some condition (or cluster of conditions) that rules out epistemic luck while preserving ordinary knowledge. Zagzebski, in influential work, argued that any simple addition to JTB will be vulnerable to a new Gettier-style counterexample; she therefore steered discussion towards accounts that directly address epistemic agency and the role of virtue.

## Examples and classroom-friendly thought experiments
Good examples illuminate how subtle the problem is. The stopped clock is a classic: if you glance at a clock that stopped exactly twelve hours ago and form the belief "it is 3 pm," your belief may be true and you may have good reason to rely on the clock, yet the truth is accidental, so we hesitate to call it knowledge. The Smith and Jones case from Gettier is essential to learn by heart; it exemplifies justified true belief without knowledge. The disjunctive Gettier case (involving a disjunction like "Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona") shows how complex logical structures can mask epistemic luck. The fake‑barn county case is useful for testing safety and reliability: someone driving through a region full of realistic barn facades sees the only genuine barn and forms the belief "there is a barn"; intuitively we are reluctant to say they know, because most nearby possibilities would make the belief false.

Using these examples in essays helps demonstrate understanding and shows you can apply abstract conditions to concrete scenarios. When practicing, try to vary examples to show familiarity with both standard and teacher-created cases.

## Broader significance: knowledge, scepticism and other sources of knowledge
The discussion about justified true belief and Gettier intersects with wider epistemological issues. Historically, debates about knowledge led to sceptical challenges: how can we be sure that our beliefs about the external world are not massively mistaken? Gettier cases do not directly vindicate global scepticism, but they do show that ordinary accounts of knowledge are incomplete and require deeper analysis. The analysis of knowledge also interacts with discussions about perception and reason as sources of knowledge: what counts as justification for perceptual beliefs, and how do a priori intuitions and deductive arguments (for example in mathematics) fit into our general account? Knowledge theory therefore cannot be isolated; it must connect to accounts of perception, testimony, memory, and rational insight.

When studying set texts such as Plato’s Meno, Descartes’ Meditations, and modern pieces by Gettier and Zagzebski, look for how each author contributes either to the classical picture or to the corrective moves that followed. The historical sweep—from Plato’s attempts to distinguish true belief from knowledge, through Descartes’ quest for indubitable grounds, to Gettier’s modern counterexamples—illuminates why contemporary epistemology remains engaged with the problem of luck and justification.

## Exam technique
Begin essays by defining key terms precisely: distinguish propositional knowledge from acquaintance and ability knowledge, and state the tripartite formulation of knowledge as justified true belief. Use a Gettier case (for example, Smith and Jones) to show why JTB is insufficient. When presenting responses, be systematic: explain the proposal (no false lemmas, infallibilism, reliabilism, safety/sensitivity, virtue epistemology), show how it handles standard Gettier cases, and then subject it to critical evaluation. Use named examples (stopped clock, fake barn, disjunctive cases) to test each account and show critical engagement.

Balance AO1 (clear, accurate exposition of views and arguments) with AO2 (evaluation and sustained critical judgement). Explicitly link points to set texts and named philosophers where relevant, showing that you can place ideas in historical and conceptual context. Avoid unsupported intuitions: whenever you claim a view succeeds or fails, say why and offer a counterexample or an argumentative pressure it cannot meet. End with a concise conclusion that answers the question you were asked rather than merely summarising what you have written. Time management is crucial: plan for clear definitions and one or two strong critical lines rather than many superficial points.
