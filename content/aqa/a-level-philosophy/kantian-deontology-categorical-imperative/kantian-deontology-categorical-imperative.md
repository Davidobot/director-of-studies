# Kantian deontology and the categorical imperative (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: what Kant wanted to achieve
Immanuel Kant set out to produce a moral theory grounded not in feelings, social customs or consequences, but in reason itself. His project was to show that there is an objective source of moral duty accessible to any rational being. Kant thought that morality must have authority: it must command without appealing to particular desires. To achieve this he argued for a conception of duty based on the “good will” and on imperatives that apply to reason irrespective of what we want. Kantian deontology therefore contrasts sharply with consequentialist approaches that judge actions by outcomes, and with virtue approaches that emphasise character. When revising Kant, it helps to keep in mind his two central aims: to explain what gives moral demands their authority, and to explain what makes an action morally worthy.

## The good will and moral worth
For Kant the only thing that is good without qualification is the good will. Talents, riches, happiness and even virtues can be used for bad ends; they are not unconditionally good. The moral worth of an action, then, does not lie in favourable consequences or in being naturally inclined to act kindly, but in the motive behind the action: acting from duty. This requires a distinction between acting in accordance with duty and acting out of duty. The shopkeeper who charges fair prices because it is good for business is acting in accordance with duty but not from duty; the one who does so because it is the right thing to do, even when it costs them, displays a good will and has moral worth. Kant’s insistence that moral action must be motivated by respect for the moral law underscores his claim that autonomy—self-legislation by reason—is the heart of morality.

## Hypothetical and categorical imperatives
Kant distinguishes two types of practical principles: hypothetical and categorical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative tells you what to do to achieve some end: if you want X, you ought to do Y. These imperatives are conditional and lack the unconditional authority of morality. By contrast, a categorical imperative commands unconditionally: it tells you what you must do regardless of your desires. The categorical imperative is the form of the moral law. When Kant moves from the observation that rational agents act under rules to the claim that they can only consistently will certain universal rules, he constructs moral requirements as necessary and universal demands of reason. Understanding this formal contrast is crucial for applying Kant’s test of morality: is a maxim something a rational being could will as a universal law?

## The first formulation: universal law and the test of contradiction
Kant’s first formulation of the categorical imperative is usually given as: “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.” A maxim is the principle or policy behind an action—what you propose to do and why. The universalisation test asks us to imagine a world in which everyone acted on the same maxim. Two kinds of contradiction can show a maxim to be impermissible. A contradiction in conception occurs when universalising the maxim would make the very action impossible; for example, the maxim “I will lie whenever it benefits me” cannot be universalised because if everyone lied whenever it suited them, the institution of promising and the practice of giving or trusting information would collapse; the concept of a lie presupposes truth-telling, so the maxim defeats its own possibility. A contradiction in will is subtler and arises when universalising a maxim does not make the action impossible but would be something a rational agent could not will because it frustrates some necessary end of rational beings. For instance, one might universalise a maxim of refusing help to others, and although such a world is conceivable, it is not something a rational agent could will because it would undermine the conditions that make pursuing one’s ends possible.

Teaching Kant well means making students practice formulating clear maxims and running them through the universalisation test. A common revision exercise is to contrast maxims at different levels of generality: the maxim “I will not help strangers” may be impermissible, but the maxim “I will not help strangers when I am busy and it will not inconvenience me” might be trivialised and escape condemnation unless correctly formulated. Kantian analysis requires precise maxims that capture the intention behind an action rather than accidental circumstances.

## The second formulation: humanity as an end in itself
Kant’s second formulation of the categorical imperative complements the first by focusing on persons rather than abstract will. It runs: “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means.” Here Kant introduces a moral distinction between things and persons: persons are ends in themselves because they are rational agents capable of setting ends. Treating someone as a mere means is to use them instrumentally, denying their rational agency and intrinsic dignity. This formulation helps to explain why certain actions—deception, coercion, exploitation—are wrong even if they produce good consequences. It also underpins Kant’s idea of dignity: human beings have a moral worth that excludes price and therefore cannot be bought or sold morally.

An application of this formulation is the famous “lying to the murderer at the door” problem. If a murderer asks whether your friend is hiding in your house, Kant seems to forbid lying because lying uses the murderer as a means to achieve a good end and universalising lying leads to contradictions. Critics argue this result is counterintuitive because it appears to demand that you allow harm rather than lie to save a life. Kantans have responded in several ways: by insisting that you may not lie but may refuse to answer or warn the person indirectly, or by re-emphasising the distinction between what is morally permissible and prudential acts of self-preservation. When teaching, present both the intuitive counterexample and Kantian responses so students can see the tension between moral principle and common-sense judgments.

## Kingdom of ends, autonomy and the structure of duties
Kant develops his theory further with the idea of the “kingdom of ends,” an ideal community in which every rational being legislates universal laws through their maxims, treating themselves and others as ends. This thought-experiment ties together autonomy—the capacity for self-government—as the source of moral law and the universality required by the categorical imperative. From this framework Kant draws distinctions between perfect and imperfect duties. Perfect duties are strict and admit no exceptions (for example, do not lie), while imperfect duties are more flexible and require us to cultivate certain ends (for example, to help others or develop talents). The notion of autonomy also opposes heteronomy, the idea that moral laws could be imposed from outside by tradition, inclination, or divine command in a way that undermines rational self-legislation. Kant’s ethical system therefore places rationality and respect for persons at the centre of moral deliberation.

## Key criticisms and Kantian replies
Kantian ethics has faced several prominent criticisms, and preparing revision answers requires being able to present these critiques and Kantian responses clearly. One classic problem is the rigidity of rules: critics claim Kant cannot accommodate moral dilemmas where duties clash, or where following a duty produces severe harm. Kantian replies usually emphasise the careful formulation of maxims and the distinction between perfect and imperfect duties; some defenders appeal to detailed analyses that resolve apparent conflicts by showing one duty is more fundamental or by refining the maxims involved. Another criticism is that Kant gives inadequate moral weight to emotions, virtues, or intentions other than duty, reducing morality to cold formalism. Kant himself allows respect, sympathy and affection an important place in moral life, but insists they cannot be the basis for moral obligation. A further line of attack points to the ambiguity of formulating maxims: trivial or selfishly tailored maxims can often be universalised, leading to unhelpful or arbitrary results. Kantian scholars respond by insisting on a correct method for specifying maxims—one that captures the agent’s intention and relevant circumstances—and by highlighting the role of practical reason in adjudicating among competing formulations.

Students should also be ready to compare Kant with utilitarianism and virtue ethics. Where utilitarianism judges by consequences, Kant judges by form and motive; where virtue ethics focuses on character and flourishing, Kant focuses on duty and respect for rational beings. These contrasts offer excellent opportunities to balance criticism and defence in exam answers.

## Exam technique
When approaching questions on Kant, begin by defining key terms: good will, duty, maxim, categorical and hypothetical imperatives, universalisability, and treating humanity as an end. Use one or two clear examples early on to show you understand how the theory applies—simple, well-chosen scenarios such as keeping promises, lying to a murderer, or a shopkeeper’s honesty work well. Structure your response so that exposition and analysis are clearly separated: explain Kant’s argument first, showing how the categorical imperative functions, then offer critical engagement. When evaluating, present strong objections and follow them with Kantian replies or your own assessment of their persuasive force. Always connect criticisms back to Kant’s central commitments—autonomy, universality, and respect for persons—so your critique is grounded in the theory rather than anachronistic complaints. Finally, conclude by addressing the question directly, weighing strengths and weaknesses and offering a reasoned judgement. Quality beats quantity: precise definitions, accurate application, and carefully reasoned evaluation will score highly.
