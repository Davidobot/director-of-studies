# Philosophy of mind: dualism, physicalism and consciousness (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What we mean by 'mind' and mental states
When philosophers talk about the mind they are concerned with the nature and status of mental states: thoughts, beliefs, desires, sensations, intentions and experiences such as pain or the redness of an apple. Two important features often highlighted are phenomenal properties and intentionality. Phenomenal properties are the qualitative, subjective aspects of experience — what it is like to taste coffee or see red — and are sometimes called qualia. Intentionality is the ‘aboutness’ of mental states: beliefs and desires are directed at things in the world. Clarifying these features helps us ask whether mental states are reducible to, identical with, or entirely distinct from physical states of the brain and body. Many of the classic debates in philosophy of mind turn on whether mental phenomena can be explained within a physicalist framework, or whether some form of dualism is required to account for consciousness and subjective experience.

## Substance dualism: minds as distinct substances
Substance dualism is the view that minds and bodies are two fundamentally different kinds of substance. René Descartes is the classic advocate: the thinking thing (res cogitans) is distinct from the extended thing (res extensa). Two well-known arguments linked to Cartesian dualism are the indivisibility argument and the conceivability argument. The indivisibility argument claims that bodies are spatially divisible while minds are not; since the properties differ radically, they must be different substances. The conceivability argument holds that we can coherently conceive of our minds existing without our bodies, so it is metaphysically possible for the mind to exist independently of the body, implying distinct substances.

These arguments invite several responses. Critics point out that the mind can be affected, damaged and partitioned in various neurological conditions, so the claim that mental phenomena are strictly indivisible is dubious. The conceivability move is challenged on the grounds that what is conceivable need not be metaphysically possible; mistakes about conceivability can stem from a lack of relevant empirical knowledge about brain processes. Interactionist dualism — the view that mind and body causally interact — also faces the problem of explaining how an immaterial mind could causally influence a physical body. Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia’s early modern objection to Descartes presses this point: how can a non-extended thinking thing move an extended body without violating causal principles? Ryle accused substance dualism of committing a “category mistake,” arguing that treating mind as a separate thing alongside the body misunderstands the logical role of mental vocabulary; talk of states, dispositions and capacities can be assimilated to behavioural or functional descriptions instead of positing a parallel substance.

## Property dualism: mental properties as non-physical
Property dualism accepts that there is only one kind of substance (the physical), but maintains that mental properties are not reducible to physical properties. This view is often motivated by thought experiments that aim to show that physical information alone cannot capture subjective experience. Frank Jackson’s knowledge argument introduces Mary, a scientist who knows all the physical facts about colour vision but has never seen colour. When Mary sees red for the first time, she seems to learn something new — a fact about what red looks like — suggesting that there are non-physical facts about experience. David Chalmers popularised the philosophical zombie and the hard problem of consciousness: one can conceive of creatures physically identical to us but lacking consciousness (zombies), which indicates that consciousness is not entailed by the physical.

Responses to these arguments take several forms. Some deny that Mary gains new propositional knowledge on seeing red, instead claiming she acquires a new ability (to recognise or imagine red) or new acquaintance with the property. Others question the leap from conceivability to metaphysical possibility: just because we can coherently imagine zombies or Mary’s epistemic situation does not prove such things could exist in the actual world. Physicalists may accept that our current vocabulary or understanding is limited but hold that a completed neuroscience will show how subjective states are realised physically.

## Physicalist theories: behaviourism, identity theory and eliminativism
Physicalism holds that everything is either physical or supervenes on the physical. Early responses to dualism from within a physicalist outlook include various forms of behaviourism and identity theory. Philosophical behaviourism reduces mental talk to talk about behavioural dispositions. ‘Hard’ behaviourism tried to translate mental predicates entirely into physical descriptions of bodily behaviour, while ‘soft’ behaviourism treated mental terms as shorthand for dispositions to behave in certain ways. Behaviourism struggles with internal mental life, private experiences and cases of perfect actors or ‘Super-Spartans’ who may suppress behavioural signs of pain; it also faces circularity when behaviour is used to define pain which in turn explains behaviour.

The mind-brain identity theory proposes that particular types of mental states are identical to particular types of brain states: pain is C-fibre firing, belief X is neural pattern Y. This ontological reduction aims to place mental states within the natural sciences. A major problem for type identity is multiple realisability: the same mental state might be realised by different physical states in different species or systems, making strict one-to-one type identity implausible. Eliminative materialism goes further and contends that our common-sense folk-psychological categories (beliefs, desires, pains) may be false and will be displaced by a mature neuroscience. Critics argue that folk psychology has significant explanatory power and that denying mental states undermines our own certainties about self-report and introspection.

## Functionalism and computational approaches
Functionalism reframes the debate by defining mental states in terms of their causal roles: a mental state is characterised by its relations to sensory inputs, behavioural outputs and other mental states. This view allows for multiple realisability because the same functional role can be fulfilled by different physical substrates, be they biological brains, silicon circuits or hypothetical alien physiologies. Functionalism underpins much of cognitive science and artificial intelligence, offering a framework for thinking about mind in systems terms.

Functionalism faces challenges from thought experiments designed to isolate qualia. Inverted qualia scenarios imagine two people functionally identical in behaviour and history but with swapped subjective colour experiences; the intuition that their qualia differ suggests that functional roles might not capture qualitative experience. Ned Block’s China thought experiment asks us to imagine a country-sized population arranged to perform the functional roles of a brain; would that system have subjective consciousness? If not, functional description seems insufficient. Functionalists can respond by refining what counts as relevant functional organisation or by arguing that qualia are themselves functional in some sense, but the debates highlight the tension between third-person functional explanations and first-person subjective experience.

## Consciousness, qualia and mental causation
Consciousness is the central focus of much current philosophy of mind, especially the question of how subjective, qualitative experiences fit into a causal, physical world. The “hard problem” is to explain why and how certain physical processes give rise to phenomenal experience. Some physicalists adopt reductive strategies, attempting to explain qualia in terms of representational content or higher-order information-processing. Others accept that phenomenal properties may be fundamental features of the world and seek a naturalistic framework that accommodates them without invoking immaterial substances.

The status of consciousness also raises the problem of mental causation: if consciousness is epiphenomenal — a by-product of physical processes with no causal efficacy — this seems to conflict with the evident causal role of mental states in our behaviour. If pain causes withdrawal, how can pain be causally inert? Epiphenomenalism tries to preserve a physicalist ontology while acknowledging the distinctiveness of qualia, but it must explain how consciousness evolved and why it correlates with behaviour if it plays no causal role. Evolutionary arguments suggest that consciousness must have conferred some adaptive advantage, which pressures theories to give consciousness a causal or at least explanatory place in natural selection.

## Methodological issues and the problem of other minds
Much of the literature hinges on methodological questions: how far can intuition and conceivability carry us when making metaphysical claims? Thought experiments are powerful pedagogical tools but their status is disputed; critics warn against overreliance on intuitions that can be culturally or empirically naive. Another enduring philosophical problem is the problem of other minds: how can one justify belief in other conscious beings given the privacy of one’s own experiences? Philosophers appeal to analogy, inference to the best explanation, or cognitive science findings about shared neural structures to answer this challenge. The problem of other minds intersects with many of the earlier debates: if mental states are behaviourally or functionally defined, then outward behaviour and functional organisation are natural grounds for attributing minds; if mental states are essentially private qualia, the epistemic gap between self and others becomes sharper.

Understanding these methodological limits helps students evaluate arguments critically. When an argument moves from conceivability to metaphysical possibility, or from epistemic intuitions to ontological conclusions, assess whether the bridge is justified. Many disputes turn on definitions (what counts as a genuine explanation of consciousness?) and on whether a proposed theory respects both the phenomenology of experience and the success of the physical sciences.

## Exam technique
When answering A-level questions on dualism, physicalism and consciousness, aim first to demonstrate clear knowledge (AO1): define key terms such as qualia, intentionality, substance dualism, property dualism, physicalism, functionalism and epiphenomenalism. Use short, precise explanations of classic arguments — for example, state the premises of Descartes’ conceivability argument, outline Jackson’s knowledge argument, or summarise Chalmers’ zombie intuition. Show awareness of different forms of argument (deductive, inductive, thought-experimental) and be explicit about the strength of the conclusion each yields.

For analysis and evaluation (AO2), structure essays so that every claim is supported by argument or example, and balance exposition with criticism. When you present a thought experiment, follow it with the standard objections and at least one substantive reply. Compare competing theories: show how physicalism handles neural evidence and multiple realisability, and how dualism accounts for subjectivity but struggles with interaction. Use philosophers’ names to anchor points, but focus on the arguments rather than mere authority. Bring in realistic examples — neurological cases, everyday reports of experience, or imagined scenarios like Mary or the inverted spectrum — to illustrate abstract claims.

Time management is crucial. Spend the first few minutes planning: decide your thesis, the order of topics and the key criticisms you will develop. Write coherent paragraphs that begin with a topic sentence and end with a clear point linking back to the question. In longer essays, aim for a clear conclusion that weighs up the arguments and gives a reasoned judgement: for example, you might argue that physicalism is more plausible given scientific progress but that the hard problem shows important explanatory gaps worth further philosophical work.

Finally, use precise language and signpost your argument to the reader. Avoid vague claims such as “consciousness is mysterious”; instead say what is mysterious, why a particular theory cannot yet explain it, and what would count as progress. Show evaluative depth by considering implications: does a theory make room for mental causation? Does it undermine moral responsibility? Such connections demonstrate a rounded philosophical understanding and help to secure the higher mark bands.
