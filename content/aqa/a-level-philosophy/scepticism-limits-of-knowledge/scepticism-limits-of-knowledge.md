# Scepticism and the limits of knowledge (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What philosophical scepticism is and why it matters
Philosophical scepticism is the disciplined doubt that questions whether we can know what we think we know. It is not simple everyday incredulity or scepticism about a particular claim; it is a methodological and sometimes global challenge to the possibility of knowledge itself. Where a shopkeeper questions a receipt, philosophical scepticism asks whether we can know the external world, other minds, or even our own beliefs with certainty. The point of raising sceptical scenarios is often constructive: they force us to clarify what we mean by "knowledge," sharpen our definitions, and expose hidden assumptions in our epistemic practices. In the A-level course this theme runs through debates about perception, the tripartite analysis of knowledge, the a priori/a posteriori distinction, and the status of religious and moral claims. Recognising the subtlety of philosophical scepticism—its capacity to be both a problem and a philosophical tool—is the first step to handling exam questions that ask you to assess sceptical arguments and their consequences.

## The tripartite analysis and Gettier-style problems
A central starting-point for modern scepticism is the tripartite account of propositional knowledge: to "know that p" is to have a belief that is true and justified. This neat definition invites close inspection because it sets out individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions. The most famous challenge to the tripartite view comes from Edmund Gettier, whose short thought-experiments show that one can have a justified true belief that strikes us as true by luck rather than knowledge. Gettier cases typically involve a justified belief based on good evidence that, by coincidence, turns out true for reasons other than the believer’s justification. The standard philosophical responses to Gettier fall into several families. One approach strengthens the justification condition so that it must be infallible; another adds a "no false lemmas" condition, forbidding any false premises in the chain of reasoning. Reliabilism replaces justification with a claim about the reliability of the belief-forming process, while virtue epistemology links knowledge to intellectual virtues: a knower must be epistemically reliable in a character-centred sense. When you study these options, focus on how each response aims to block the "luck" that Gettier highlights and whether it risks collapsing into scepticism by demanding too much.

## Perception and the sceptical challenge
Perception is the most ordinary route to knowledge about the world, yet it gives rise to powerful sceptical arguments. Direct realism claims that perception puts us directly in contact with mind-independent objects and their properties. Against this view, the argument from illusion points out that perceptual errors—such as a bent-looking stick in water—make it unclear whether the immediate object of perception is the external object or some subjective appearance. Perceptual variation, where different observers or conditions present different properties (a coin looks circular from one angle, elliptical from another), strengthens this worry. Hallucination and brain-in-a-vat scenarios put further pressure on direct realism by imagining experiences indistinguishable from veridical perception but lacking any external cause. Indirect realism responds by introducing sense-data or sense-impressions as the immediate objects of perception, thereby preserving the existence of a mind-independent world at the cost of a representational gap. The resulting epistemological worry is scepticism about whether those mind-independent objects exist or are knowable.

Philosophers have offered varied replies. Locke appealed to the involuntary character of experience and the coherence of diverse perceptions to argue that we are justified in believing in an external world. Russell characterised belief in the external world as the "best hypothesis" to explain sensory experience. Berkeley took a radical step: he rejected the existence of mind-independent material objects altogether and defended an idealist account in which ordinary objects are collections of ideas perceived and sustained by God. When you handle exam questions on perception, make sure you can explain the arguments from illusion, variation and hallucination clearly, and assess whether each response meets the sceptic's demand for certainty or simply offers a plausible but fallible justification.

## Descartes, methodic doubt and the distinction between local and global scepticism
Descartes famously used methodic doubt to test belief foundations by systematically stripping away anything that could be doubted. His three "waves of doubt" begin with the unreliability of sense perception, continue with the possibility of dreaming (where everything we take to be waking experience could be a dream), and culminate in the hypothesis of a malicious deceiver — an evil demon who guarantees that even our logical and mathematical beliefs might be false. Descartes’ project was not to endorse radical scepticism but to find a firm foundation that survives doubt: the cogito — "I think, therefore I am" — which he treats as an indubitable a priori intuition. From there he attempts to rebuild knowledge, invoking God to guarantee the reliability of clear and distinct ideas and thereby to secure knowledge of the external world.

Understanding Descartes is crucial for two reasons. First, his method highlights the difference between local scepticism, which targets specific domains (for example, scepticism about perception or about other minds), and global scepticism, which undermines all knowledge claims. Second, his responses exemplify the move from radical doubt to foundationalism — the attempt to base knowledge on certain basic beliefs. Make sure in essays to distinguish Descartes’ skeptical method from scepticism as a final verdict; the aim is epistemic reconstruction, and the effectiveness of his replies is a major point for assessment.

## Broader responses and the limits of knowledge
Beyond Cartesian replies, the modern epistemological landscape offers several influential strategies for answering scepticism. Empiricists like Locke and Hume argue that knowledge ultimately rests on sensory experience and habits of association; Hume, in particular, draws a sharp distinction between matters of fact and relations of ideas, inviting scepticism about metaphysical claims that go beyond experience. Russell treats belief in the external world as a reasonable induction: given the systematic nature of sensory inputs and the success of ordinary explanations, positing an external world is the best hypothesis. Reliabilism reframes justification in terms of belief-forming processes that ordinarily produce true beliefs, thereby answering scepticism pragmatically rather than promising infallibility. More recent virtue epistemologists claim that knowledge is an achievement of intellectual character and skill, and that sceptical scenarios often exploit a demanding, overly strong conception of epistemic success.

It helps to see scepticism in practice: suppose you wake and find a red apple on the table. Ordinary epistemic practice treats your perceptual belief "There is an apple" as justified. A sceptic will ask whether you could be dreaming, hallucinating, or deceived by a demon. The variety of responses can be assessed on several grounds: do they restore certainty, or only reasonable belief? Do they avoid circularity (for example, using perceptual facts to justify the reliability of perception)? Do they respect our ordinary epistemic practices while explaining away the sceptic’s challenge? A good exam answer will weigh these considerations and reach a nuanced judgment about how seriously scepticism should worry us.

## Teaching and learning tips: connecting texts, examples and concepts
When revising scepticism and the limits of knowledge, anchor abstract themes to the set texts and to vivid examples. Use Descartes’ Meditations to trace the methodic doubt and his arguments for the cogito and God; read Gettier’s brief paper as the source of the modern problem for justified true belief; consult Berkeley’s Three Dialogues to see idealism worked out in conversational form. Practice converting thought-experiments into clear argument structures: identify premises, sub-conclusions and the inferences that link them. Translate Gettier scenarios into the trio of belief, truth and justification to show precisely why they are problematic. For perception, rehearse the stick-in-water, the coin seen from different angles, and a hallucination or dreaming case, and then show how each challenges direct realism or supports indirect realism.

Philosophy exams reward clarity and precision. When you write about scepticism, be explicit about distinctions such as a priori/a posteriori, analytic/synthetic, and local/global scepticism. Explain technical terms (for example, "infallibilism" or "reliabilism") and then evaluate them rather than merely defining them. Use the set texts to bolster AO1 knowledge, but use original examples and critical evaluation to demonstrate AO2 skills. Teachers often advise preparing short comparative paragraphs that set two thinkers in dialogue — for example, Descartes versus Hume on the possibility of certain knowledge — because this structure mirrors many exam questions about competing responses to scepticism.

## Exam technique
In exams, begin by carefully defining key terms and stating the question you will answer. If a question asks you to "assess" a sceptical argument, outline the argument in clear premises and conclusion before evaluating it. Balance exposition and evaluation: allocate time so you can both explain a philosopher’s view (AO1) and critique it (AO2). Use concrete examples and thought-experiments to test claims, and make explicit which form of scepticism is under discussion (local or global). When evaluating responses, consider whether they meet the sceptic on her own terms or concede too much; for instance, does a reliabilist reply grant that knowledge must be infallible, or does it sensibly accept fallible but reliable knowledge? Where appropriate, refer to set texts and specific arguments (for example, Gettier's cases, Descartes' evil demon, Russell's best hypothesis), but do not rely solely on quotation—explain relevance and implications. Conclude with a reasoned judgment that summarises your assessment and acknowledges remaining tensions: examiners reward thoughtful, well-supported positions that show you understand why the problem matters and why no single response closes the debate once and for all.
