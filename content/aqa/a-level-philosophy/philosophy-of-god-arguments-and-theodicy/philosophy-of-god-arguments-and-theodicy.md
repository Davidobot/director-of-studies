# Philosophy of God: classical arguments and theodicy (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## The concept and attributes of God

At A-level you will need a clear, flexible account of what is meant by “God” in classical theism because many arguments turn on which attributes are being assumed. Typically God is presented as omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful) and omnibenevolent (supremely good). There are further questions about God’s relation to time: is God timeless (outside time, eternal) or everlasting (existing throughout time)? These choices matter. For example, if God is timeless, then one must explain how a timeless being can have knowledge of temporal events; if God is everlasting, questions about change and temporality arise. Philosophical puzzles also flow from the divine attributes themselves. The “paradox of the stone” asks whether omnipotence is coherent: can God create a stone so heavy that even God cannot lift it? Either answer seems to limit omnipotence. The Euthyphro problem poses a moral challenge: is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is good? If the former, morality looks arbitrary; if the latter, goodness appears independent of God. A further tension is between divine foreknowledge and human freedom: if God knows in advance every choice a person will make, can that person genuinely act otherwise? These conceptual puzzles set the stage for the classical arguments for and against God’s existence and for responses to the problem of evil.

## Ontological arguments: necessity, a priori reasoning and objections

Ontological arguments aim to show that God’s existence follows from the very concept of God, and they are characteristically a priori and deductive. St Anselm’s original argument invites us to conceive God as “that than which nothing greater can be conceived”; existing in reality is greater than existing merely in the understanding, so God must exist. Descartes offered a version that treats existence as a perfection among God’s attributes and therefore inseparable from the idea of a supremely perfect being. Norman Malcolm and later modal formulations press the idea that if God’s existence is possible then God must exist necessarily. These arguments are powerful because they promise a priori certainty, but they also draw sharp objections. Gaunilo’s “perfect island” parable challenges Anselm by showing how the same reasoning could, absurdly, be used to prove the existence of any supposed perfect thing. Kant’s classic reply is that existence is not a predicate or property that adds to the concept; saying that something exists does not enhance the concept in the way other properties do. Teaching this topic profitably involves highlighting the logical form: specify whether an argument tries to establish necessity or mere probability, and consider whether the premises are conceptual truths or illicitly move from thought to reality.

## Cosmological arguments: contingency, causation and the first cause

Cosmological arguments, in contrast, are typically empirical or metaphysical and seek to explain why there is something rather than nothing. Aquinas offered several variants: arguments from motion, causation and contingency argue that the series of movers, causes and contingent beings point to a first, unmoved, uncaused necessary being. The Kalām cosmological argument stresses temporal beginning: everything that begins to exist has a cause; the universe began to exist; therefore the universe has a cause. Leibniz framed the debate via the Principle of Sufficient Reason, asking why contingent facts obtain and positing God as the best explanation for the existence of the cosmos. The strengths of cosmological arguments lie in their appeal to common causal intuition and their explanatory ambition. Criticisms include doubts about whether infinite regress is impossible, Hume’s challenge to the universal application of causal principles beyond observed experience, and the fallacy of composition (the claim that because parts have causes the whole must have one). Another important move in assessing cosmological reasoning is to ask what the argument concludes: does it prove a particular theistic God with personal attributes, or merely a first cause of some sort? Students should practise identifying whether a premises supports a strictly deductive proof or an inductive best‑explanation.

## Teleological and design arguments: order, analogy and probability

Design arguments draw on the appearance of order, purpose or fine-tuning in the world to infer a designer. Paley’s famous watchmaker analogy argues that just as a watch’s complex arrangement implies a designer, so too the intricate order in biological organisms implies a divine designer. Hume anticipated many modern criticisms in pointing out limits to analogical reasoning: the universe is a unique case so analogies with human artifacts have restricted force, and the complexity might be brute, or the product of many designers, or the result of natural processes. Contemporary defenders such as Swinburne recast design as an inference to the best explanation: regularities in time and the apparent fine-tuning of physical constants make the existence of an intelligent creator a probable explanation. Evaluation here turns on probability judgments and on alternative explanations such as natural selection, chance, or multiverse hypotheses. Teaching this area benefits from contrasting the logical form: Paley’s is an argument from analogy, Hume’s critiques appeal to weaknesses of analogy and to competing hypotheses, while modern probabilistic accounts require careful attention to priors and background knowledge.

## The problem of evil and theodicy: logical and evidential challenges

The problem of evil is the most sustained challenge to classical theism. It divides into a logical problem—arguing that the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God is logically incompatible with the existence of evil—and an evidential problem, which claims that the amount, kinds or distribution of evil make God’s existence unlikely. Distinguishing moral evil (evil due to free agents) from natural evil (suffering from natural causes, like earthquakes) is crucial because different responses are available. Alvin Plantinga’s Free Will Defence aims to show that the co‑existence of God and evil is possible: a world containing creatures with libertarian free will may include evil as a consequence of that freedom, and God could not create free creatures who never choose evil without removing freedom. This defence does not attempt a theodicy (an explanation showing why God allows specific evils) but rebuts the claim of logical inconsistency. John Hick’s “soul‑making” theodicy is an evidential response arguing that some suffering is necessary for moral and spiritual development; a world in which virtues like courage and compassion arise might require exposure to risk and hardship. Evaluative work here requires weighing whether theodicies adequately explain gratuitous or extreme suffering, whether they make God morally blameless, and whether they address the asymmetry between intense, undeserved suffering and the goods purportedly produced.

## Religious language and meaningfulness

Philosophical discussion of God is not only about whether God exists but also about the status of religious language. Logical positivists argued that metaphysical and theological claims are literally meaningless because they cannot be empirically verified; this led to the verification principle which demands observable criteria for meaningful statements. Critics pointed out that the verification principle itself is not empirically verifiable. Antony Flew formulated a related test of meaning in terms of falsifiability: a genuine claim must be such that counter‑evidence could count against it. Flew’s “gardener” parable suggests that religious believers often reformulate beliefs to evade refutation. Opponents of Flew defended the cognitive content of faith: some argued that religious assertions are genuine but not easily falsifiable because their standards of evidence differ, while John Hick proposed “eschatological verification” by suggesting that the truth of religious claims might be verifiable after death. This debate is pedagogically useful because it forces students to think about what it is to assert a truth claim, how belief can respond to evidence, and whether non‑empirical language can carry cognitive content. In essays, relate these issues to how religious claims function practically in life and to whether meaningfulness is the same as truth‑aptitude.

## Assessing argument forms and making philosophical judgments

Throughout this topic you must pay close attention to logical form and the strength of conclusions. Different arguments aim for different kinds of success: a deductive proof aims to establish entailment (if the premises are true, the conclusion must be), while inductive and abductive arguments aim for probability or explanatory plausibility. Identifying whether an argument relies on metaphysical principles (such as the impossibility of an infinite regress), modal claims (possibility and necessity), empirical premises (the universe began to exist), or analogical reasoning helps you evaluate it. Use counterexamples to test claims, ask whether premises are demonstrable or merely plausible, and consider whether a successful conclusion proves theism as usually conceived or only a more modest metaphysical thesis (a first cause, a necessary being, an intelligent explanation). Good answers bring in relevant voices from the curriculum—Anselm, Aquinas, Paley, Hume, Plantinga, Hick—without merely listing them: explain how each thinker’s move contributes to or undermines the theistic project, and finally weigh competing considerations to reach a reasoned judgement.

## Exam technique

In exams begin by defining key terms and setting out the argument’s logical form so the examiner sees your AO1 (knowledge and understanding). Make the structure of your answer explicit: state the premises and conclusion, note whether the argument is deductive, inductive, or abductive, and give a short, precise exposition of the argument in your own words. When evaluating (AO2), alternate between strengths and weaknesses: present a careful objection, explain why it matters, and then, where appropriate, show how the original defender might respond. Use concrete examples (Gaunilo’s island against Anselm; Paley’s watch; the Kalām’s beginning‑to‑exist premise) to illustrate abstract points. Always consider the scope of a conclusion—does the argument establish the classical God or something weaker?—and address important counter‑responses from the syllabus (for example, Plantinga on the problem of evil, Kant on the ontological argument, Hume on design and causation). In your conclusion balance the arguments you have discussed rather than simply asserting a personal belief: weigh the most persuasive strengths against the most damaging objections and explain why one side has the edge. Time management is crucial: aim to spend proportionally more time on higher‑mark questions, and leave a few minutes to tighten definitions and ensure clarity. Quality of argument, precise terminology, and clear engagement with set texts will move you from description to reasoned evaluation, which is what the examiners are looking for.
