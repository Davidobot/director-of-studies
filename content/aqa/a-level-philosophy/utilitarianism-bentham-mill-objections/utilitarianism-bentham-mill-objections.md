# Utilitarianism (Bentham, Mill and objections) (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What utilitarianism is: the basic idea and why it matters
Utilitarianism is a consequentialist moral theory: it says that the rightness or wrongness of actions depends entirely on their outcomes. At its core is the principle of utility, often stated as "the greatest good for the greatest number." The theory treats the good as something that can be aggregated across people so that we compare total amounts of good produced by alternative actions and choose the action that maximises that total. This simplicity is one reason utilitarianism has been so influential: it offers a clear decision procedure for moral problems and connects morality to human welfare, making ethical problems tractable and publicly testable. Yet that very appeal—reducing ethics to consequences and a single measure of value—raises important philosophical questions about what counts as the good, how to measure it, and how to respect justice and personal relationships.

## Jeremy Bentham: quantitative hedonism and the felicific calculus
Jeremy Bentham, the founder of classical utilitarianism, understood the good as pleasure and the bad as pain. For Bentham, pleasure and pain are the only intrinsic goods and evils, so moral calculation reduces to comparing pleasures and pains. His famous felicific or "hedonic" calculus proposes factors to measure the moral value of actions: intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity (nearness in time), fecundity (likelihood of producing further pleasures), purity (freedom from pain), and extent (number of people affected). Bentham imagined that, in principle, these factors could be weighed to produce a quantitative score for any act. This radical impartiality treats each person's pleasure as equally important and aims to maximise the total sum of pleasure minus pain.

Bentham’s approach is attractive for its clarity and democratic spirit: no agent's happiness is privileged over another's. But the felicific calculus, while helpful as an ideal, faces practical and theoretical difficulties. Measuring pleasures numerically is often impossible; different kinds of pleasure may not be commensurable; and the approach seems to permit morally counterintuitive actions when they increase aggregate pleasure, such as punishing an innocent person if that creates more utility overall. These tensions prompted later thinkers, most notably John Stuart Mill, to revise Bentham’s hedonism.

## John Stuart Mill: qualitative hedonism and higher pleasures
John Stuart Mill accepted the utilitarian core but argued that some pleasures are qualitatively superior to others. Mill introduced the idea of higher and lower pleasures to respond to critiques that utilitarianism reduces human beings to pleasure-seeking animals. Higher pleasures—those of the intellect, imagination, and moral sentiments—are intrinsically more valuable than lower bodily pleasures. Mill suggested that competent judges, people with experience of both sorts of pleasure, would consistently prefer higher pleasures, and this preference shows their greater worth.

Mill also offered a defence or "proof" of the greatest-happiness principle by arguing that people desire happiness, and since moral terms are connected to what people want, goodness can be understood in terms of promoting happiness. This argument is not a deductive proof but an attempted explanation of the link between our moral sentiments and utility. Mill’s modifications retain classical utilitarianism’s impartiality while trying to safeguard human dignity and sophistication of experience.

Nevertheless, Mill’s appeal to competent judges introduces vagueness: who counts as competent and why should preference establish intrinsic value? Critics question whether this move successfully distinguishes qualitatively superior goods or simply smuggles in a kind of elitism.

## Variants and developments: act, rule, preference and non-hedonistic utilitarianism
Utilitarianism has diversified beyond Bentham and Mill. Act utilitarianism applies the principle of utility directly to each action: an agent should perform the act that produces the most utility in the specific situation. Rule utilitarianism, by contrast, recommends following rules that, if generally adopted, maximise utility. Rule utilitarians claim this addresses problems of calculation and moral reliability: it is often easier and safer to follow a best-rule than to calculate consequences case by case. Preference utilitarianism shifts the focus from pleasure to the satisfaction of preferences: the good is getting what people want rather than maximizing hedonic states. This variant often appears in modern moral philosophy and economics because it aligns with welfare measured by preference satisfaction. Non-hedonistic utilitarian models may appeal to objective lists of goods or to well-being concepts broader than pleasure, allowing the theory to respond to intuitions that value things like autonomy or knowledge intrinsically.

Each variant attempts to keep utilitarianism’s consequentialist core while responding to different objections. The trade-offs between flexibility, clarity, and respect for rights or moral rules determine which version appeals to different theorists.

## Strengths and attractions of utilitarianism
One major strength of utilitarianism is its impartiality: it takes every person’s interests into account equally, which fits democratic and humanitarian ideals. Its consequentialism also connects moral decision-making to predictable outcomes and public policy, which makes the theory attractive for social and political ethics, where costs and benefits can be compared. Utilitarianism’s simplicity provides a practical decision procedure and a normative yardstick for evaluating institutions and laws: policies can be defended or criticised in terms of the good they bring about. Moreover, utilitarianism encourages moral concern for strangers and distant consequences, which many moral systems do not explicitly require.

## Major objections and problems
A set of classic objections challenges utilitarianism from different angles. Nozick’s experience machine raises a problem for hedonistic accounts: if offered a life of profound pleasure simulated by a machine, many people would reject it, suggesting that pleasure is not the only intrinsic good; things like authenticity, achievement, and reality matter. Relatedly, Mill’s higher pleasures try to answer this, but the experience machine test shows that attractions beyond pleasure can be morally important.

Justice and rights criticisms claim utilitarianism can justify obviously unjust acts. If violating one person's rights produces more overall utility, classical utilitarianism appears to endorse that violation. The "tyranny of the majority" highlights how the majority’s welfare can oppress minorities under utilitarian aggregation. This worry also underpins concerns about moral integrity: Bernard Williams’ famous thought experiments suggest utilitarian demands can force agents to betray deep personal commitments and projects merely to increase aggregate welfare, undermining moral identity.

Practical objections include the problem of calculation: real-life consequences are complex, uncertain, and temporally extended, so reliably computing the utility-maximising option is often impossible. The demandingness objection argues utilitarianism requires excessive moral sacrifice: agents must always act to maximize utility, which can demand that individuals give up significant personal projects or resources. Partiality seems impossible under strict utilitarianism: special obligations to friends and family appear morally binding but are hard to reconcile with the impartial requirement to treat all interests equally.

Finally, critics target utilitarianism’s treatment of motives and blame. If only outcomes matter, intentions and character may seem irrelevant, but many moral intuitions take intentions seriously. These objections form a rich repertoire of challenges for students to engage with: they expose the costs of an uncompromising commitment to aggregation and consequentialism.

## Responses, revisions and contemporary positions
Utilitarians have developed several responses. Rule utilitarianism attempts to protect rights and reduce injustice by endorsing rules whose general observance produces more utility than their violation, thereby resisting case-by-case violations for short-term gain. Two-level utilitarianism combines rule and act approaches: people follow utility-promoting rules in ordinary life but revert to act-level calculation in genuine emergencies. Preference utilitarians answer the experience machine by insisting that the satisfaction of informed preferences—preferences that take into account concerns about reality—captures what people value. To deal with demandingness, some utilitarians accept threshold constraints or "satisficing" versions that require contributing to overall good only up to a reasonable level.

Other modern replies embed rights into utilitarian frameworks by treating rights as rules with strong utility-based justification, or by weighting certain deontic constraints highly in social utility calculations. Philosophers also develop pluralist consequentialisms that count multiple intrinsic goods rather than a single hedonic measure, aiming to respect a richer set of moral values while keeping the consequentialist structure. These developments show that utilitarianism is not a single monolithic doctrine but a family of theories that can be adapted in light of the strongest objections.

## Applying utilitarian thinking to everyday moral problems
Applying utilitarianism illuminates how the theory works in practice and exposes its challenges. Consider stealing: a utilitarian asks whether stealing produces more overall welfare than alternatives. If a small theft saves a starving family and produces more net benefit than harm, act utilitarianism may permit it, while rule utilitarianism might forbid stealing because a general rule against theft promotes trust and greater utility long-term. For lying, utilitarianism considers whether the lie increases overall happiness: lying to comfort a dying person may be permissible if it reduces suffering and causes little harm, but systematic lying undermines trust and can reduce aggregate utility.

On eating animals, utilitarians weigh the pleasure humans gain from eating meat against the suffering of animals. Preference utilitarians count animals’ preferences, potentially supporting vegetarianism if animal suffering outweighs human enjoyment. Simulated killing, such as in video games, raises questions about whether virtual actions have real consequences. Utilitarians focus on actual outcomes: if such practices desensitise people and increase real-world harm, they are wrong; if they provide harmless release that reduces real harm, they may be permitted. These applications show utilitarian reasoning yields context-sensitive answers and that different variants of utilitarianism can imply different policies.

## Exam technique
When writing exam answers on utilitarianism, begin by clearly stating which version of utilitarianism you are discussing and summarise its core claim. Use concise, structured prose: explain Bentham’s felicific calculus and Mill’s higher pleasures, then move to distinctions such as act versus rule utilitarianism and preference utilitarianism. Always illustrate theory with short examples to demonstrate understanding. For evaluation, present at least two substantial objections and unpack them with clarity, explaining their force and giving possible utilitarian replies. Aim to balance AO1 (knowledge and explanation) and AO2 (analysis and evaluation): show you understand philosophical terms and arguments while critically assessing strengths and weaknesses.

Structure longer essays by allocating time: use the first third for clear explanation, the middle third for critical engagement with objections, and the final third for responses, synthesis, and a considered conclusion. When comparing theorists, highlight how Mill revises Bentham and how later variants address specific problems. Precise terminology matters—use terms like consequentialism, felicific calculus, higher/lower pleasures, impartiality, and utility correctly. Finally, in conclusion, evaluate whether the responses you have discussed resolve the problems or merely mitigate them, and indicate which version of utilitarianism you find most plausible and why. This approach will demonstrate both factual knowledge and philosophical judgement.
