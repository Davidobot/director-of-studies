# Meta-ethics: moral realism, anti-realism and emotivism (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What meta-ethics asks and why it matters
Meta-ethics investigates the nature, status and meaning of moral claims rather than asking which acts are right or wrong. It asks questions such as: Do moral statements report facts about the world, or do they express feelings, prescriptions or social conventions? If moral facts exist, are they part of the natural world or are they of a different kind? These questions matter because the answers shape how we think about moral disagreement, moral reasoning, responsibility and progress. For a student, being clear about the distinction between normative ethics (what we ought to do) and meta-ethics (what moral language and judgments are) is essential: normative theories presuppose some meta-ethical view, and meta-ethical positions determine how we interpret arguments in applied ethics.

## Cognitivism and non-cognitivism: the basic division
One of the first distinctions to learn is between cognitivism and non-cognitivism. Cognitivists hold that moral statements are truth-apt: sentences like “Stealing is wrong” express propositions that can be true or false. Non-cognitivists deny this: they claim moral sentences primarily express emotions, prescriptions, or attitudes and therefore are not truth-apt in the ordinary sense. This division makes an immediate difference to how we treat moral disagreement. If moral sentences are truth-apt, disagreement can be a disagreement about objective facts; if they merely express feelings, so-called disagreements may instead track differences in attitude or desire. It is also helpful to distinguish, within cognitivism, between moral realism—the view that there are mind-independent moral facts—and forms of cognitivism that accept truth-aptness but deny objective moral facts.

## Moral realism: naturalism and non-naturalism
Moral realism holds that there are moral facts or properties that exist independently of our attitudes. Realists divide into naturalists and non-naturalists. Moral naturalists claim moral properties are identical to or reducible to natural properties, such as pleasure, biological flourishing, or social welfare. This is an attractive approach because it promises to place ethics within the realm of empirical investigation and moral progress becomes intelligible as improving knowledge of natural facts.

Non-naturalist moral realism, by contrast, argues that moral properties are real but not reducible to natural properties. Intuitionists typify this view: they claim humans have a faculty of moral intuition that allows us to apprehend basic moral truths directly, in a way analogous to grasping a mathematical truth. A famous move against reductive accounts is the “open question” type of objection, which suggests that for any proposed naturalistic definition of goodness, it always makes sense to ask “But is that really good?”—indicating that the concept of the moral cannot be exhausted by naturalistic description. Non-naturalists must then explain what makes their moral properties both knowable and metaphysically odd, and how they relate to empirical facts.

Realists face familiar challenges. Naturalists must avoid the “naturalistic fallacy” and show that reducing moral terms to natural terms does not simply conflate descriptive and normative vocabularies. Non-naturalists must explain how we can have knowledge of non-natural moral properties and why those properties would motivate agents. Both camps must show how moral knowledge can be objective without becoming mysterious.

## Moral anti-realism: error theory, emotivism and prescriptivism
Anti-realism denies mind-independent moral facts. Error theory, as one cognitivist form of anti-realism, accepts that moral language expresses propositions and that people intend to state facts, but maintains those propositions are systematically false because there are no moral facts. Error theorists explain persistent moral discourse as based on a widespread but false belief in moral properties; they must then account for why moral talk is so pervasive and useful despite being false.

Non-cognitivist anti-realism includes emotivism and prescriptivism. Emotivism interprets moral statements primarily as expressions of emotional attitude: to say “Killing for pleasure is wrong” is to express disapproval and to attempt to influence others’ attitudes. This reduces moral language to emotional expression plus influence. Prescriptivism, by contrast, treats moral statements as prescriptions: calling an action “wrong” is to issue a prescription against it that, in some formulations, carries a universalizing force—if you prescribe X in situation S then you must prescribe X in any situation relevantly similar.

Both emotivism and prescriptivism aim to explain features of moral discourse that realism struggles with, such as the motivational force of moral claims and the variability of moral codes. They also face important problems: non-cognitivists must explain how moral reasoning and logical relations between moral statements work, since if moral statements are not truth-apt it is hard to see how one moral claim can validly imply another. Furthermore, they must account for moral disagreement and the sense of moral progress that many people experience.

## Key objections and challenges: Hume, Mackie and logical problems
Several historical and conceptual objections are central to assessing meta-ethical views. David Hume's observation that one cannot derive an ‘ought’ from an ‘is’ challenges reductionist attempts to ground moral claims purely in empirical facts; meta-ethicists need to explain how moral normativity connects to the natural world without illicitly bridging that gap. Another important line of criticism is the argument from disagreement: the wide variety of moral systems might suggest moral relativism or make the realist's posit of objective moral facts less plausible.

John Mackie’s criticisms shaped contemporary anti-realist thinking. Mackie argued that the extent of moral disagreement and cultural diversity supports a form of scepticism about objective moral values, and he advanced an “argument from queerness” that moral properties would be metaphysically strange and epistemologically suspect in a way that other properties are not. Mackie's error theory uses these points to claim that all positive moral claims are false.

Non-cognitivists face the Frege–Geach problem, which presses them to explain how moral statements can enter into logical relations—such as in complex arguments—if they merely express attitudes. For emotivists in particular, the challenge is to show how the same moral sentence can perform different roles in different logical contexts (for example, asserting “Stealing is wrong” and using “If stealing is wrong, then encouraging stealing is wrong”) without treating it as a propositional claim. Responses have included more sophisticated semantic theories that treat emotive content as part of a broader meaning and defend a logic of attitudes, but students should be clear on why the Frege–Geach problem matters to any non-cognitivist theory.

## How meta-ethical views explain moral language and practice
A useful way to test meta-ethical theories is to see how they account for everyday moral features: moral disagreement, moral persuasion, moral reasoning, moral motivation and moral progress. Realists have a straightforward story for disagreement and progress: people disagree about moral facts and progress consists in getting closer to those facts. They also can accommodate moral reasoning as inference from true premises. Anti-realists must reinterpret disagreement as clashes of attitude or error, and persuasion as changes in emotional stance or acceptance of prescriptions; explaining the persuasive and normative force of moral language is often their key task.

Consider a practical example: two people disagree about whether it is permissible to eat animals. A moral realist can argue that one person’s evidence and reasoning lead them closer to an objective moral truth about animal suffering and rights, while the other has false beliefs. An emotivist explains the disagreement as differing attitudes and sees moral argument as usually aiming at changing feelings or prescriptions, not at discovering metaphysical facts. Prescriptivists emphasize the role of universalizability: the vegetarian’s stance, if truly prescriptive, should be recommended in any similar context, which gives a rational constraint on what prescriptions are acceptable.

Students should also be comfortable applying meta-ethical positions to normative and applied cases. For instance, if you adopt a moral naturalist utilitarianism, moral claims about eating animals reduce to claims about utility, suffering and pleasure; if you adopt emotivism, the ethical debate is about competing attitudes and strategies for persuasion rather than competing facts.

## Comparative strengths and weaknesses
When comparing positions, assess their explanatory scope and their plausibility. Moral realism’s strength is its fit with ordinary moral discourse and its ability to ground moral objectivity and progress. Its weakness comes from explaining how moral properties are known, whether they can fit into a naturalistic worldview without begging the question, and from dealing with alleged moral diversity. Error theory offers a radical diagnosis of moral discourse but must explain why humans adopt and maintain a systematically false moral outlook. Emotivism and prescriptivism preserve the motivational and practical aspects of moral talk and avoid positing doubtful metaphysical entities, but they struggle to accommodate logical structure in moral argument and to meet the intuition that some moral claims seem truth-apt. A good essay will not merely list these pros and cons but will show how each problem pushes a theory to develop or to adopt resources from other approaches.

## Teaching tips and useful clarifications
When teaching these topics, start from familiar moral sentences and ask students to classify them as truth-apt or not, and then to test those classifications in thought experiments: what would follow if moral sentences were purely emotive? How would moral debate look? Encourage students to rehearse core objections in their own words: explain why Hume thought reason alone cannot motivate action, why the open question argument aims at naturalism, or why the Frege–Geach problem endangers simple non-cognitivism. Use named examples to anchor abstract claims: the “experience machine” worries for utilitarian naturalists, a hypothetical “moral zombie” style case for discussions about motivation and moral knowledge, and simple everyday disagreements for demonstrating how the theories handle persuasion.

Students should also learn precise terminology—cognitivism, non-cognitivism, moral realism, naturalism, non-naturalism, error theory, emotivism, prescriptivism, the open question argument, the naturalistic fallacy, Hume’s is-ought gap—and be able to explain how these terms connect to the arguments. Encourage linking meta-ethics back to normative ethics and applied cases so that theory remains relevant and testable.

## Exam technique
Begin exam answers with a clear definition of the view you are discussing and state briefly what you will argue. For AO1 aim to explain the theory carefully: set out what it claims about the status of moral language, give a straightforward example, and name a key proponent. For AO2 move quickly to evaluation: present the strongest objections and the best responses, showing awareness of subtle distinctions such as cognitivist anti-realism (error theory) versus non-cognitivism. Use short thought experiments or practical examples to illuminate abstract points, and always show why a criticism matters for the theory’s overall plausibility. When comparing positions, focus on one or two central criteria—such as explanatory power concerning disagreement and moral motivation, or the ability to support moral reasoning—and weigh how each theory performs rather than merely listing attributes. Structure long answers so that each paragraph advances either explanation, objection, or reply, and end with a concise judgement that recognises strengths and weaknesses and justifies your conclusion. Time your examination by allocating minutes per section and leave a few minutes to proofread key definitions and to sharpen your concluding paragraph.
