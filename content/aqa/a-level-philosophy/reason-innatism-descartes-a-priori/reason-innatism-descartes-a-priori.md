# Reason, innatism and Descartes' a priori knowledge (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: reason, a priori knowledge and why it matters
Reason and a priori knowledge are central topics in epistemology because they ask whether we can know anything independently of experience, and if so, how. A priori knowledge is knowledge that is justified independently of particular sensory experience: mathematical truths, certain logical inferences, and some metaphysical claims have traditionally been offered as examples. The debate about innatism — the view that some ideas or concepts are present in the mind from birth or are knowable independently of experience — sits at the heart of this subject. Understanding innatism requires not only knowing the historical arguments from Plato, Leibniz and Descartes, but also the empiricist responses from thinkers such as Locke, and later critical developments like Hume’s sceptical challenge. In practice, this topic tests your ability to define key terms, reconstruct arguments (intuitions and deductions), consider objections and replies, and make reasoned evaluations.

## Innatism: Plato and Leibniz
Innatism is the claim that the human mind contains certain ideas or dispositions prior to experience, or that some truths are accessible by reason alone. Plato famously illustrates this with the slave-boy example in the Meno: through questioning the boy comes to recognise a geometrical truth that, on Plato’s account, he could not have learned from experience alone. Plato uses this to argue that learning is recollection of knowledge the soul had before birth. Centuries later Leibniz defended a more sophisticated version of innatism. He argued that there are necessary truths — truths that could not be otherwise — such as those of logic and mathematics, and that these truths presuppose innate principles or dispositions in the mind. For Leibniz, the existence of necessary truths shows that the mind possesses concepts or tendencies not derived from particular sensory impressions; these truths can be discovered by reflection and rational analysis rather than by induction from experience.

Both Plato and Leibniz emphasise different kinds of evidence for innatism. Plato uses the dialectical method and the idea of recollection; Leibniz emphasises the modal status of necessary truths and the explanatory role of innate principles in accounting for our ability to recognise such truths. For students, it is useful to see these positions as offering two linked claims: first, that some concepts or capacities are prior to experience in the sense that empirical input alone cannot account for them; second, that reason (or the intellect) can, by intuition and deduction, arrive at knowledge that experience could not provide.

## Empiricist responses: Locke and the tabula rasa
Empiricist responses deny or weaken the innatist claim. John Locke famously rejected innate ideas and proposed instead that the mind at birth is a tabula rasa, a blank slate, on which sensory experience writes. Locke distinguishes between simple impressions or ideas derived directly from sensation and reflection, and complex ideas formed by combining simple ones. He argues that what looks like innate knowledge can be explained by generalisation, education, or the mind’s capacity to form abstract concepts from repeated sensory experiences. Locke challenges innatism by pointing out that if ideas were truly innate, they should be universally accepted and present in all human minds; but children and people in different cultures do not always possess or assent to the putative innate propositions.

Locke also sharpens the debate by asking for psychological and epistemic mechanisms that could account for supposed innate knowledge. He suggests that observation, habituation and the mind’s powers of abstraction provide these mechanisms. When teaching this exchange, it helps to use concrete examples: consider how children learn the concept of number or colour words, and whether repeated exposure and social practice can explain their acquisition without invoking pre-existing ideas.

## Intuition and deduction: what they are and how they work
Central to the innatist position is the intuition and deduction thesis: the idea that some truths are known by intellectual intuition and that others follow from them by deduction. Intuition here is not mystical insight but a kind of immediate rational awareness or apprehension of a proposition’s truth without appeal to sensory input. Deduction is the process of reasoning in which further truths are derived from intuitions or principles by logical steps that preserve necessity.

A useful way to clarify the distinction is to compare arithmetic and empirical science. The claim “7 + 5 = 12” is often treated as a paradigmatic a priori intuition that is knowable by reason alone; once certain arithmetic principles are in place, further arithmetical consequences follow by deduction. By contrast, the claim “it rained yesterday” is empirical and known by sensory experience. The intuition/deduction framework underpins many rationalist arguments: if we can show that some principles are certain and non-empirical, then rational deduction from them can produce substantial a priori knowledge.

It is important for A-level work to distinguish a priori from analytic, and to note that not all a priori claims are merely analytic truths. Analytic statements are true in virtue of meanings or definitions, while synthetic a priori claims (a debated category) would be informative about the world yet knowable independently of experience. Rationalists often claim that some substantive truths about mind, God or metaphysics can be established a priori, whereas empiricists are sceptical about such claims.

## Descartes: method, clear and distinct ideas, and the cogito
René Descartes is the most systematic classical defender of a priori rational insight. His method of radical doubt aims to strip away beliefs that could be subject to any doubt, leaving only those that are absolutely certain. From this method emerges the cogito: the claim “I think, therefore I am” (cogito ergo sum), which Descartes treats as an example of an a priori intuition. The cogito, he argues, is indubitable because doubt presupposes a doubter; thinking and the existence of the thinker seem inseparable in the act of reflection.

Descartes further argues that the mind can apprehend certain ideas as “clear and distinct.” A clear idea is present and manifest to the attentive mind; a distinct idea is precise and differentiated from other ideas. For Descartes, clear and distinct perceptions provide a trustworthy foundation; when the mind perceives something clearly and distinctly, we are justified in accepting it as true. From these epistemic primitives, Descartes tries to deduce further truths: crucially, he offers arguments for the existence of a benevolent God and a subsequent defense of the external world. The existence of a non-deceiving God, once established by a priori deduction from clear ideas, secures the reliability of clear and distinct perception and thereby allows us to move from pure reason back to everyday knowledge.

In teaching Descartes, emphasise the methodological unity: radical doubt, the cogito as a first indubitable insight, the role of clear and distinct ideas as criteria of truth, and the a priori proofs for God that serve an epistemic function. Use examples: mathematical truths are accepted as clear and distinct, and the cogito is treated as a paradigmatic case because introspection seems immediately to reveal the thinking self.

## Objections and responses: Hume, empiricism and later critiques
Empiricist critics raise a number of objections to innatism and to Descartes’ a priori project. David Hume famously divides knowledge into matters of fact and relations of ideas. Relations of ideas, like mathematics, are necessary and knowable without experience but tell us nothing about contingent facts in the world. Matters of fact, by contrast, are known only by experience and admit of doubt. Hume’s fork challenges the move from purely conceptual truths to substantive claims about existence: if a claim is not analytic, why should we accept it a priori? Hume also questions causal inference, which weakens any attempt to deduce contingent empirical conclusions merely by reason.

Specific objections to the cogito point out that even the cogito’s status as an indubitable a priori truth is not immune to scrutiny. Some philosophers argue that the cogito presupposes language or a conceptual framework, and that the inference “thinking implies existing” may not be the sort of insight Descartes assumes. Others challenge Descartes’ proofs of God, arguing that existence is not a predicate and that the move from conceptual perfection to actual existence commits a logical error. More pragmatic responses question whether clear and distinct ideas are an infallible criterion: history shows that philosophers and mathematicians can be mistaken about what seems self-evident.

Descartes and his defenders offer replies. They can accept that some a priori claims are analytic while insisting that certain metaphysical and theological claims are nonetheless accessible by reason. They can defend the cogito by stressing the immediacy of self-awareness. They can also argue that Hume’s skepticism does not defeat the status of mathematical and logical truths, and that rational insight remains a legitimate source of knowledge, even if its scope is contested.

## Teaching applications and classroom examples
When preparing students, it helps to use simple, replicable exercises to make abstract distinctions concrete. For innatism, replicate Plato’s questioning style by guiding students to rediscover a geometrical or arithmetic truth through carefully framed questions; this demonstrates how Socratic method suggests knowledge can be elicited rather than taught. For Locke’s empiricism, assign observational tasks or experiments in perception and then ask students to reflect on whether the concepts used could have arisen without repeated experience. To make the intuition/deduction distinction vivid, present mathematical proofs side-by-side with empirical reports and ask students to identify what justifies each claim.

Teach Descartes by reconstructing his method step by step: start with sensory doubt, move to the dream and evil demon hypotheses, and arrive at the cogito. Ask students to evaluate each stage: is the doubt coherent, is the cogito really immune to doubt, and does the argument for God succeed in securing knowledge of the external world? Use counterexamples and thought experiments to practise evaluation: what would Hume say about the evidence needed to move from conceptual truths to claims about existence? Encourage students to write short responses that state the claim, give an argument, offer an objection and conclude with an assessment—this mirrors examination demands.

## Exam technique
In answers, begin by defining the key terms: a priori, a posteriori, intuition, deduction, innate idea, and tabula rasa. Precise definitions score AO1 marks and give you a firm base for argument. When explaining an argument, reconstruct it in clear steps and identify whether it is analytic/deductive or synthetic/inductive. Use examples—mathematical truths for a priori intuition, perception reports for a posteriori knowledge—to illustrate points. Always include objections: present the best empiricist challenge to innatism, then offer the strongest defender’s reply. For evaluation, weigh the plausibility of premises and the logical connection to the conclusion, and comment on the scope of the claim (does it imply global rationalism, or only limited a priori knowledge?). Manage time by allocating roughly equal time to exposition and evaluation, and end with a concise judgement that balances the arguments you have discussed.
