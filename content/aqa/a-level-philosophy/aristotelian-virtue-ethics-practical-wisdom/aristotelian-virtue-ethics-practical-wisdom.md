# Aristotelian virtue ethics and practical wisdom (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: virtue ethics in context
Aristotelian virtue ethics offers a distinctive way of thinking about morality by focusing on character and flourishing rather than primarily on rules or consequences. Rather than asking "What action produces the best outcome?" or "What duty must I follow?", Aristotle asks "What kind of person should I be?" and identifies the good life for human beings as flourishing or eudaimonia. This approach roots moral evaluation in the development and exercise of stable dispositions—virtues—that enable a person to live well in a human community. For A-level study, it is important to see Aristotle's account as a systematic ethical theory with its own methods and problems: it contains claims about human nature, a diagnostic account of virtues and vices, an account of moral education, and an appeal to practical wisdom (phronesis) as the intellectual virtue that guides right action.

## Eudaimonia and the function argument
Eudaimonia, often translated as "flourishing" or "happiness", is not a transient feeling for Aristotle but the final end of human life, a complete and self-sufficient good that makes life desirable. Aristotle motivates this by the function argument: if every craft or activity has a function, then human beings must have a function that, when performed well, constitutes the good for humans. He argues that the characteristic function of human beings must involve the rational part of the soul. Therefore, the human good consists in rational activity performed excellently, that is, in accordance with virtue. This links ethics to an account of human nature: virtues are qualities that enable the rational part of the soul to perform well, and living virtuously is the route to eudaimonia. A-level students should be able to explain how Aristotle moves from an account of function to a normative claim about what makes life good for humans and how this differs from views that reduce the good to pleasure or to conformity with duty.

## Virtues, vices and the doctrine of the mean
Aristotle treats virtues as stable character traits or dispositions that lie between two extremes: a deficiency and an excess. Courage, for example, is a mean between rashness (excess) and cowardice (deficiency); generosity lies between prodigality and stinginess. This "doctrine of the mean" is not a call for mathematical middling but a demand for the appropriately proportioned response in a given situation. Virtues concern not only action but the feelings and rational choices that motivate actions; they are dispositional and become part of who a person is. For teaching, it helps to emphasise that the mean is relative to the individual and the circumstance: what counts as courageous for one person in one situation may differ for another, which introduces a sensitivity to particulars rather than one-size-fits-all rules. Students should be comfortable giving concrete examples and explaining why Aristotle resists moral absolutism in favour of context-sensitive judgement.

## Habituation, education and moral responsibility
Aristotle places great emphasis on moral formation. Virtues are acquired by habituation: we become courageous by repeatedly performing courageous acts, temperate by practising temperance, and so on. Parents, laws, friendships, and the political community all play a role in shaping virtuous character. Moral education involves both training the passions and cultivating reason, since moral virtue requires right feelings as well as right actions. Aristotle also distinguishes voluntary, involuntary and non-voluntary actions in relation to moral responsibility. Voluntary actions originate in the agent and with knowledge of particulars; involuntary actions arise under force or through ignorance and affect praise and blame differently. This framework helps explain the agent-centred side of moral assessment in Aristotelian ethics: virtues are not merely tendencies but integrated patterns of motivation, cognition, and behaviour that reflect moral responsibility.

## Practical wisdom (phronesis) and moral reasoning
Practical wisdom, or phronesis, is the intellectual virtue that enables an agent to deliberate well about how to live and act. It differs from theoretical wisdom in being concerned with particulars and action rather than universal truths. While moral virtues are about the right feeling and disposition, practical wisdom is the capacity to perceive the salient features of a situation, to balance competing considerations, and to hit the mean. It is developed through experience and is exercised in context: one who has phronesis knows how to apply general moral insight to the messy particulars of life. For Aristotle, virtuous action requires both moral virtue and phronesis; having a disposition alone is not enough if one lacks the judgement to apply it. In classroom practice, emphasise that phronesis plays the role of moral perception and deliberation, guiding choices where rules or formulas fail. Practical wisdom thus provides an Aristotelian reply to the charge that virtue ethics lacks action-guidance: it is not that Aristotle gives a decision-procedure but that he locates guidance in cultivated practical judgement.

## Applying virtue ethics to moral problems
When applied to concrete moral problems, Aristotelian virtue ethics asks what a fully flourishing person would do, or what course of action expresses and cultivates the virtues relevant to the situation. For example, in a case of stealing to feed one’s starving family, a virtue ethicist would focus less on whether a universal rule prohibits theft and more on the agents and motives involved: is the act compassionate, does it reflect practical wisdom, and how would it affect the agent’s character and the community’s moral fabric? With telling lies, the central concern is whether the lie stems from vicious dispositions such as deceitfulness or from a compassionate judgement to prevent serious harm; the virtuous response will reflect the mean as discerned by phronesis. This approach highlights strengths and weaknesses: virtue ethics brings attention to character, motives and the moral psychology of agents, but critics claim it can struggle to offer clear-cut answers and to adjudicate conflicts of virtues. In teaching, use applied examples to show how phronesis works in practice and to illustrate how virtue ethics differs in structure and focus from utilitarian or deontological reasoning.

## Criticisms and contemporary responses
Aristotelian virtue ethics faces several classical criticisms that are useful for evaluation and exam discussion. One worry is that it gives insufficient action-guidance: if the doctrine of the mean is context-sensitive and phronesis is experiential, how can novices know what to do? A reply is that moral education and typified examples, including exemplars, form part of ethical training; ethics is a skill learned over time, not a matter of following rules from the first encounter. Another criticism is circularity: defining virtuous acts by reference to the virtuous person and vice versa seems to lack independent criteria. Contemporary supporters respond by distinguishing between a moral vocabulary used to identify exemplars and a normative account that can be defended by appeal to human flourishing. Questions also arise about cultural relativism and whether eudaimonia as a human good can be objectively specified across different societies. Modern virtue ethicists have developed richer accounts of virtues, linked them to human psychology and social goods, and sought to show how virtues cohere with other moral theories rather than replace them entirely. In exams, demonstrating awareness of objections and plausible replies is essential to form strong, balanced evaluations.

## The relationship with other ethical theories
Virtue ethics contrasts sharply with consequentialist and deontological approaches and comparing them can deepen understanding and earn synoptic marks. Unlike utilitarianism, which measures morality by outcomes or aggregate utility, Aristotle places intrinsic value in the cultivation of character and the excellence of the agent’s faculties. Unlike Kantian deontology, which appeals to duty and universal maxims, Aristotle emphasises particular judgement and the role of emotions and social context. This does not mean Aristotelian ethics ignores actions or rules; rather, it relocates moral primacy to character and practical judgement. In modern debates, virtue ethics is often presented as complementary: it can supply the motivational and character foundations that make rule-following or consequentialist calculation meaningful. For students, being able to contrast approaches by using the same applied case can reveal how the different frameworks prioritise features of moral life and illuminate strengths and weaknesses.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Aristotelian virtue ethics and practical wisdom, begin by defining key terms clearly: eudaimonia, virtue, doctrine of the mean, habituation, phronesis, voluntary/involuntary action. That establishes strong AO1 content and ensures examiners know you understand the concepts. Next, reconstruct Aristotle’s central arguments in your own words, for example explaining the function argument and how the virtues enable rational activity to achieve human flourishing. Use set-text references to show familiarity with primary material, and illustrate abstract claims with concrete examples such as courage between rashness and cowardice, or a case of telling a lie to protect someone. Examples help to show you can apply theory to particulars, an important skill in A-level philosophy.

For evaluation (AO2), raise and explain standard criticisms—such as the problem of action-guidance, the charge of circularity, and concerns about cultural variability—and then respond to them. Responses can include appeals to moral education, the role of exemplars, the distinction between intellectual and moral virtues, and contemporary elaborations that address earlier gaps. Comparisons with utilitarian and Kantian accounts demonstrate breadth and can gain synoptic credit; explain not only differences but why Aristotle might see those other approaches as incomplete. Always aim to balance criticism with reply, and avoid dismissing objections without considered answers.

Structure your essays with a clear introduction that sets out your plan, followed by paragraphs that develop definitions, argument reconstruction, application, and critical assessment, and conclude with a judgement that summarises the strengths and limits of Aristotelian virtue ethics. Time management is crucial: allocate time to planning, writing, and revising; leave time to incorporate an evaluative conclusion rather than ending abruptly. Use precise philosophical vocabulary, avoid vague assertions, and ensure each paragraph advances your argument. Quotations, when used sparingly and accurately, can strengthen a point, but most of the mark comes from your clear exposition and reasoned evaluation. Practice past paper questions to refine how you integrate AO1 knowledge with AO2 critical skills, and aim to show that you can not only describe Aristotle’s theory but also assess its significance for moral thought and real-life moral decision-making.
