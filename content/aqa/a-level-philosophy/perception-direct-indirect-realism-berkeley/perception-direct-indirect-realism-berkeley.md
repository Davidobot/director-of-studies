# Perception: direct/indirect realism and Berkeley (A-level Philosophy Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: what the debate is about
Perception is the philosophical study of how we come to know the world through our senses. At the heart of the debate are two competing claims about the immediate objects of perception. Direct realists (also called naive realists) hold that when you see, hear or touch something you are directly aware of the mind‑independent object itself and some of its properties. Indirect realists claim that perception places a mental intermediary—often called a sense‑datum or representation—between the perceiver and the external world: the immediate object of awareness is not the physical object but a mental presentation caused by it. George Berkeley offers a radical alternative, denying the existence of mind‑independent material objects altogether and arguing that what we call bodies are collections of ideas perceived by minds. Understanding the arguments for and against each view, and the responses they provoke, is central to A‑level study of perception.

## Direct realism: the intuitive view and the challenges
Direct realism captures common sense: when you look at a tree you are directly seeing the tree. The theory is attractive because it preserves the immediacy and fidelity of perception, and it makes everyday knowledge of the world straightforward. However, a number of classic problems challenge the claim that perception puts us in direct contact with mind‑independent things.

The argument from illusion points out cases where perception misleads us. A straight stick partly submerged in water looks bent. If perception were simply a direct relation to the stick, it is puzzling why its appearance changes in these circumstances. The argument from perceptual variation notes that properties such as colour, shape and size can seem different under different conditions. A distant tower looks small though its size does not change; a red apple under different lighting may appear brownish. These variations suggest that what is immediately before the mind is not the stable set of properties the object “really” has.

The argument from hallucination raises a sharper worry. In a hallucination a subject seems to have a perceptual experience indistinguishable from a veridical perception, yet there is no external object to perceive. If the two experiences can be subjectively the same while the presence of an external object differs, it is hard to maintain that the immediate object of both experiences is the external object. The time‑lag argument adds that distant events are perceived only after a delay (we see the sun as it was eight minutes ago), so perception can never be of the world as it presently is but at best of a past state. Together, these challenges press direct realists to explain how their view can accommodate error, variation and the phenomenology of hallucination.

Direct realists offer responses. Some deny that illusions and hallucinations are genuinely perceptual in the same way as veridical perception; they treat such cases as fundamentally different mental states. This move is developed in disjunctivism, which maintains that veridical perception and hallucination are distinct kinds of mental events even if they can feel similar. Others argue that perceptual variation does not undermine direct contact with objects because perceptual experiences represent objects under particular conditions and from particular perspectives; the mind‑independent object is still the source of those experiences.

## Indirect realism and sense‑data: Locke, qualities and sceptical consequences
Indirect realism says we are immediately aware of sense‑data or perceptual representations that are caused by mind‑independent objects. John Locke supplies a classic statement of a related idea through his distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities—such as extension, solidity and motion—are said to be in the object and to resemble our ideas of them. Secondary qualities—colour, taste, smell—are powers in objects to produce certain sensations in us. On this account, what we directly perceive are ideas whose contents are caused by things in the external world.

This framework helps explain illusion and perceptual variation: differences in lighting or perspective change the sense‑data even though the external object remains the same. It also provides a causal story linking perception with the world: sensory ideas are produced by external causes. Yet indirect realism faces a serious sceptical challenge. If all we ever directly know are sense‑data, how can we be justified in inferring the existence or the exact nature of the mind‑independent objects that cause those sense‑data? If sense‑data might be systematically deceptive, scepticism about the external world seems to follow.

Philosophers who defend indirect realism have advanced several responses. Locke appealed to the involuntary character of our sensory experiences: we do not choose to have a red sensation or a particular pain; their involuntariness suggests an external cause and so grounds belief in the existence of mind‑independent objects. Another response emphasises the coherence of experiences across different senses, times and observers: the way perceptions correlate and interlock supports the inference to a common external source. Bertrand Russell later argued that the best explanation for the regularities and systematicity of our sense‑data is the existence of an external world that causes them; hence the external world is the “best hypothesis.” These causal and abductive responses aim to show that indirect realism need not collapse into radical scepticism.

## Berkeley’s idealism: rejecting material substance
George Berkeley offered a profound critique of the whole project of postulating mind‑independent material substance. He challenged the very distinction between primary and secondary qualities that Locke had relied on. Berkeley’s point was that all qualities we attribute to objects are ultimately ideas in perceivers; nothing we ever directly conceive of corresponds to an unperceived material substratum. To say that primary qualities resemble or resemble the object is to suppose that there is some non‑perceptual thing that has those qualities in itself, but we have no way to formulate what such a thing would be like except in terms of ideas. Thus, for Berkeley, to talk of “matter” as something beyond perception is either empty or contradictory.

Berkeley’s famous slogan is “to be is to be perceived” (esse est percipi). He argues that we can never conceive coherently of an object existing unperceived: the act of conceiving it is itself a kind of perception. His “Master Argument” attempts to show that any attempt to imagine an unperceived object fails because the imagination or conception is a form of perception. From this Berkeley concludes that sensible objects are collections of ideas and that their continued existence when no finite mind perceives them is secured by being perceived by an infinite mind—God. God, as a perceiver who is always perceiving, provides permanence and order to the ideas that constitute what we call the world.

Berkeley’s position eliminates the gulf between sense‑data and material objects: there are only ideas and minds. Many students find this attractive for its coherence and its bold solution to sceptical doubts about the external world: if reality consists of ideas in the divine and finite minds, then the worry that there may be no external causes is dissolved.

## Objections to Berkeley and replies
Berkeley’s idealism provokes several persistent objections and puzzles. One immediate worry is illusion and hallucination. If objects are ideas, then a hallucination is still an idea; the distinction between veridical perception and illusion seems blurred. Critics ask whether Berkeley can distinguish degrees of veridicality and offer a satisfactory account of error. Berkeleyans typically reply that the difference lies in the order and regularity of ideas: veridical perception involves ideas that are part of a stable system sustained by God, whereas hallucinations are irregular and disordered productions.

A second major objection is that Berkeley’s position seemingly leads to solipsism: if the only things that exist are ideas and minds, how can we be sure other minds exist? Berkeley avoids solipsism by insisting on the common, systematic nature of many of our perceptions and by positing God as the cause of shared order. But some critics press further: the appeal to God appears ad hoc or metaphysically costly. Is it coherent to say that God “perceives” in the sense humans do, given that God does not sense or feel in the finite way humans do? Berkeley’s reply is that divine perception is not like human sensation; God’s perception is the sustaining reality that guarantees the order of ideas without requiring sensation as we know it. This response raises complex theological and metaphysical issues and is a central focus of criticism in textbooks and essays.

Another objection presses Berkeley’s attack on primary/secondary qualities: if primary qualities are also ideas, must we deny that objects have any objective structure? Critics argue that Berkeley collapses an important distinction, undermining the explanatory power of science. Berkeleyans counter that scientific regularities are preserved because their account does not deny regularities in ideas; science studies orderly regularities among perceptions which are grounded in God's consistent will.

Finally, some see Berkeley’s view as counter‑intuitive because it denies the reality of the physical world we believe ourselves to inhabit. Responding to this, defenders recommend focusing on Berkeley’s philosophical aim: he is not denying the reality of the table you encounter but asserting that the table’s reality is fundamentally mental. Whether this is less or more palatable than materialist pictures depends on one’s assessment of the arguments.

## Helpful examples and clarifications for teaching
Concrete examples make these abstract positions accessible. The classic illusion case of a stick appearing bent in water shows how immediate appearance can diverge from presumed reality. Emphasising viewpoint effects—how a coin can look elliptical from the side and circular from above—helps students grasp perceptual variation. When discussing hallucination, use examples of dreaming or hypnagogic imagery that can be subjectively vivid yet unconnected to external objects. For the time‑lag argument, the sun’s apparent position is a clear everyday illustration: because light takes time to travel, what we see is the sun as it was earlier, not as it is now.

Clarify key terms: the immediate object of perception is what is directly before consciousness, not what might be causally responsible for that experience. Sense‑data are mental items posited by indirect realists to play that immediate role. For Berkeley, “ideas” denotes the same sort of mental contents but he insists they are all that existence requires. Distinguish between epistemic scepticism (claims about what we can know) and metaphysical scepticism (claims about what exists). Direct and indirect realism are responses to the perceptual problem; Berkeley is an alternative metaphysical account that reframes the debate.

When teaching the primary/secondary distinction, stress how it functions to explain differences between the physical object and the qualities experienced. Asking students whether size or shape are really in objects, or only in perception, stimulates the central intuitions that led Locke and then Berkeley to their positions.

## Exam technique
Begin answers with a clear definition of the view you are discussing and identify the immediate object of perception according to that view. When outlining arguments, give concrete examples (stick in water, coin silhouette, hallucination, the sun’s time lag) to show you understand the phenomena that motivate each theory. In analysis sections, explain not only what each philosopher claims but the underlying reasoning: for Locke, the primary/secondary distinction and the causal story; for Berkeley, the ontological move from ideas to the rejection of material substance and the role of God.

Evaluation should weigh strengths and weaknesses. When critiquing direct realism, explore both perceptual variation and hallucination and consider modern responses such as disjunctivism and representational accounts. When assessing indirect realism, discuss the sceptical challenge and then the plausibility of abductive/causal replies like Locke’s involuntary experience, the coherence argument, and Russell’s “best hypothesis” move. For Berkeley, weigh the explanatory power of idealism against charges of implausibility, solipsism and the theological cost of invoking God to secure persistence.

Structure essays so each paragraph advances a distinct point: definition, argument for, objection, reply, and implication. Use philosophers’ names accurately and link claims to the set texts when possible. Conclude by answering the question directly, stating whether the view you have analysed succeeds overall and why, and suggest what a balanced or revised position might be. Manage time by allocating equal attention to explanation and evaluation; for a 30–40 mark essay, roughly half the marks will reward clear knowledge and the other half will reward analysis and critical judgement.
