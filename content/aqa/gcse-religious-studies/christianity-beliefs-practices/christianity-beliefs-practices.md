# Christianity: beliefs and practices (GCSE Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Key beliefs: God, creation and the afterlife
Christian belief begins with God as the creator and sustainer of the universe. Christians describe God using words such as omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing) and omnibenevolent (all-loving). God is understood both as transcendent (beyond and independent of the world) and immanent (present and active within creation). The Bible contains the foundational narratives and teachings that shape Christian views about the world: Genesis presents God as the source of life and purpose, while passages such as John 1:1–3 develop the idea of the Word (Logos) active in creation. Christians vary in how literally they read Genesis; some hold to a literal six-day creation, others accept scientific accounts such as the Big Bang and see scripture as conveying theological truth rather than scientific detail. Beliefs about the afterlife are also central: many Christians believe in resurrection, judgement and eternal life in heaven, while some traditions emphasise the reality of hell and others interpret these ideas more symbolically. Phrases such as “resurrection of the body” and “life everlasting” in the creeds capture core hopes about God’s final saving work. Understanding these beliefs helps explain Christian attitudes to human dignity, stewardship of the environment and moral responsibility.

## The Trinity and how Christians talk about God
One of the distinctive doctrines of Christianity is the Trinity: the belief that the one God exists in three persons — Father, Son and Holy Spirit — who are co-equal and co-eternal. The Nicene Creed, developed to clarify early Christian teaching, expresses this doctrine and is used in many churches as a summary of core belief. Explaining the Trinity is notoriously difficult, but for GCSE purposes it is helpful to emphasise that Christians are not polytheists; rather they worship one God who is revealed in three ways. The Father is often presented as creator and sustainer, the Son as God made flesh in Jesus (the incarnation), and the Holy Spirit as God’s presence active in the world and in believers’ lives. The Holy Spirit is associated with guidance, comfort, inspiration and sanctifying Christians. Different Christian traditions emphasise aspects of the Trinity differently: Orthodox liturgy highlights mystery and worship, Catholic theology connects the Trinity with sacramental life, and many Protestant traditions stress the personal relationship with Jesus and the Spirit’s work in conversion and mission. Classroom examples, such as the use of the sign of the cross in Catholic and Orthodox practice or references to the Spirit at Pentecost, help make the doctrine concrete.

## Jesus Christ, sin and salvation
Christians believe Jesus of Nazareth to be both fully human and fully divine, the incarnate Son of God. Key events in Christian teaching are Jesus’ birth (incarnation), ministry, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension. The crucifixion is central because it is seen as the decisive act of love and atonement: through Jesus’ suffering and death, the consequences of sin are dealt with and reconciliation with God becomes possible. Christians use different models to explain how salvation is achieved: some emphasise Jesus’ death as substitutionary atonement, others stress victory over evil, and still others speak of moral example and the restoration of right relationships. The idea of original sin — that humanity is inclined towards wrongdoing — has been important, especially in Augustine-influenced traditions, but understandings vary. Salvation is commonly described as the work of God’s grace: humans receive forgiveness and new life not by strict legal obedience alone but through faith, repentance and participation in the life of the Christian community. The resurrection of Jesus is the climax of Christian hope: it demonstrates God’s power over death and promises new life for believers.

## Worship, prayer and the sacraments
Christian worship takes many forms, from formal liturgical services to informal gatherings for praise, teaching and prayer. Churches that follow a liturgy, such as Catholic, Orthodox and many Anglican congregations, use set prayers, ritual actions and readings in an ordered service. Other Protestant churches may prefer non-liturgical worship with contemporary music and spontaneous prayer. Private devotion and corporate worship both matter in Christian life: prayer can be formal (the Lord’s Prayer), set in liturgies, or informal, conversational and personal. The Lord’s Prayer is often taught as a model prayer that expresses praise, petition and trust. Sacraments mark key moments of spiritual life and differ between traditions. Catholics and Orthodox recognise seven sacraments including baptism, Eucharist (Holy Communion), confirmation and reconciliation, while many Protestant churches emphasise two (baptism and Communion) as instituted by Jesus. Baptism symbolises initiation into the Christian family; some churches practise infant baptism, seeing it as incorporation into the covenantal community, while others practise believers’ baptism, emphasising personal faith. The Eucharist is celebrated as a remembrance of Jesus’ Last Supper and a sharing in his presence. Catholics teach transubstantiation — that bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ — Orthodox have a similarly sacramental view, and many Protestants understand the Eucharist as either a spiritual presence or a symbolic memorial. Knowing these differences is helpful both for exam answers and for understanding church life.

## Festivals, pilgrimage and Christian identity
Christmas and Easter are the two major Christian festivals, each with deep theological meaning and varied cultural expressions. Christmas celebrates the incarnation, God coming into the world as a human person; Nativity narratives and carols reflect themes of wonder, humility and divine presence. Easter centres on Jesus’ death and resurrection; Holy Week, Good Friday and Easter Sunday are observed with solemnity and joy, connecting worshippers to themes of suffering, sacrifice and victory over death. Pilgrimage remains important for many Christians, offering a chance for spiritual renewal, prayer and community. Lourdes and Iona serve as contrasting examples: Lourdes is a Roman Catholic pilgrimage site associated with healing and Marian devotion, while Iona, an island monastery in Scotland, is a place associated with Celtic Christianity, retreat and mission. Modern practices such as attending a church service on Christmas or volunteering at a food bank during Advent show how festival observance can motivate social action and personal reflection.

## The role of the Church in local and global communities
The Church’s mission combines worship, pastoral care and practical service. In local communities, churches run food banks, host street pastors, offer counselling and support families in need; these activities are expressions of the Christian duty to “love your neighbour” and put faith into action. Globally, Christian organisations such as CAFOD, Christian Aid and Tearfund provide disaster relief, development aid and advocacy for justice. The idea of reconciliation — seeking to restore relationships between individuals and nations — is central to many Christian responses to conflict and social division. Christians also face questions about how to respond to persecution, how to balance evangelism (sharing faith) with respect for others’ beliefs, and how to engage in political and ethical debates about poverty, human rights and environmental stewardship. Different denominations may prioritise mission, social justice or liturgical life in different ways, and students should be able to explain how specific beliefs (for example, belief in the dignity of every person made in God’s image) underpin practical work.

## Diversity within Christianity: denominations and differing views
Christianity is not monolithic. Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant traditions share core beliefs but differ over theology, authority and practice. Catholics and Orthodox place strong emphasis on church tradition and the authority of bishops and councils, while many Protestants highlight the authority of scripture alone (sola scriptura) and the role of personal faith. Differences arise in the number and understanding of sacraments, in views about the authority of the Pope, in approaches to social issues, and in worship styles. Within Protestantism there is a wide spectrum from high-church Anglicanism to evangelical and Pentecostal movements, each with distinct emphases such as sacramentality, biblical preaching or charismatic gifts. These differences matter in exam answers: showing awareness of a variety of Christian perspectives and explaining how beliefs lead to different practices will strengthen your responses. Use examples — an Anglican Eucharist, a Baptist baptism service, a Catholic Mass — to illustrate contrasts and demonstrate understanding.

## Exam technique
When approaching GCSE questions, be clear about the two assessment objectives: AO1 asks you to demonstrate knowledge and understanding (describe, explain, give reasons and show awareness of sources of authority), while AO2 asks you to analyse, evaluate and form balanced judgements. For AO1 answers, aim to define key terms, describe beliefs or practices and support points with specific evidence such as Bible passages, creeds or examples of worship. For AO2, weigh different views, explain the strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and reach a reasoned conclusion. Structure your extended answers with a clear introduction, development of points that include evidence and explanation, and a conclusion that answers the question directly. Where the question asks for religious perspectives, include more than one Christian viewpoint and, where appropriate, non-religious positions to show contrast. Use the vocabulary of the religion accurately: terms such as incarnation, atonement, transubstantiation, sacrament, and Trinity should be used correctly. Manage your time so you leave enough space for the 12-mark evaluation questions; these attract SPaG marks, so write clearly, check spelling and punctuation, and use specialist terms. Practise applying teachings to contemporary examples — for instance, how belief in the sanctity of life affects Christian views on medical ethics — and rehearse planning short plans for 6-mark and 12-mark responses. Finally, bring your own thoughtful judgement to evaluation questions: examiners look for balanced argument and a justified conclusion, not simply memorised points.
