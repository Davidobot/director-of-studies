# Theme C: Existence of God and revelation (GCSE Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## What this theme covers and why it matters
Theme C asks whether God (or ultimate reality) exists and how, if at all, humans can know about the divine. It brings together philosophical arguments that try to prove or disprove God’s existence, religious claims about revelation (how God or ultimate truth is revealed), and everyday responses from non-religious perspectives such as atheism and humanism. Studying this theme helps you to weigh evidence, understand how different traditions justify belief, and to consider the strengths and limits of human knowledge. For Christian students the focus is often on arguments about God and on special and general revelation; for students studying other religions, enlightenment (for example in Buddhism) and other forms of revelation are also important. Throughout the theme you should link ideas to real examples and consider how beliefs affect people and communities today.

## Philosophical arguments for the existence of God: the Design and First Cause arguments
Two classical philosophical routes to belief are the Design (teleological) argument and the First Cause (cosmological) argument. The Design argument starts from the apparent order, complexity and purpose in the universe. William Paley’s famous watchmaker analogy—if you find a watch you infer a designer—illustrates the approach: the complexity of living systems, the fine-tuning of physical constants, or the beauty of nature are used as evidence for a designer. Supporters say the order and apparent purpose in the world make sense if there is an intelligent creator. Critics reply that apparent design can be explained by natural processes such as evolution by natural selection, or that inferring a designer raises further questions (who designed the designer?). The First Cause argument asks why anything exists at all and argues that there must be an uncaused cause that explains the universe’s existence. Thomas Aquinas and later formulations (including the Kalam cosmological argument) claim that an infinite regress of causes is impossible, so a necessary being (God) must exist. Defences point to the impossibility of explaining the universe without such a grounding. Critics challenge the move from “first cause” to the characteristics of the God of classical theism and question whether the universe needs an external cause at all, especially in models from modern cosmology.

Both arguments have strengths: they appeal to common-sense intuitions and to observable features of reality. Their weaknesses lie in alternative natural explanations and in philosophical objections about inference and scope. When you answer exam questions you should show the argument, give an example (such as Paley’s watch or a fine-tuning example), and then give clear reasons for and against.

## Miracles, visions and the argument from religious experience
Miracles and visions are often cited as special revelation—direct encounters or interventions by the divine. A miracle is normally described as an event that breaks or goes beyond natural laws, such as healings claimed at Lourdes or the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ miracles like the feeding of the five thousand. A vision is a reported experience in which a person believes they have seen or been spoken to by a divine being; a famous example is Saul’s conversion experience on the road to Damascus. The argument from religious experience says that many people report encounters that they interpret as divine, so there is prima facie reason to accept that God exists or acts in the world.

Critics raise important challenges. David Hume argued that miracle claims are improbable and that natural explanations or human error are more likely than genuine suspension of natural law. Psychological explanations point to hallucinations, wishful thinking, cultural conditioning or the power of suggestion. Historical miracle claims can be difficult to verify using modern standards of evidence. Supporters respond that some miracles have multiple witnesses, that conversions and life changes are hard to explain away, and that miracles as part of a wider pattern of credible religious experience offer cumulative evidence. When mentioning a miracle in an exam you should describe it briefly, explain why it supports the argument for God, and then discuss alternate explanations and Humean objections.

## The problem of evil and religious responses
One of the strongest arguments against the existence of an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God is the problem of evil. The essential challenge is this: if God is all-powerful and all-loving, why does suffering and evil exist? Philosophers distinguish between moral evil (wrong actions by humans) and natural evil (suffering from earthquakes, disease, and so on). The logical problem of evil claims that the existence of such suffering is incompatible with a God who is all-powerful, all-knowing and all-good. The evidential problem of evil suggests that the amount and kinds of suffering make God unlikely.

Religions have developed several responses. Some appeal to human free will: moral evil results from humans misusing freedom, and free will is valuable enough to justify its risks. Others offer soul-making theodicies, arguing that suffering can develop virtues such as courage or compassion and that life is a process of moral and spiritual growth. Christian thinkers like Augustine and Irenaeus offer differing models: Augustine sees evil as privation of good caused by human free will, while Irenaeus portrays suffering as part of a divine educational plan. Some religious responses accept mystery and trust in God’s greater plan, pointing to future justice or resurrection as ultimate resolution. Non-religious critics counter that gratuitous or extreme suffering, such as the suffering of innocent children, is hard to reconcile with any morally perfect creator. In essays you should present the problem clearly, give religious responses with examples, and evaluate how convincing each response is.

## General and special revelation; enlightenment as an alternative
Revelation is about how humans come to know the divine. The distinction between general and special revelation helps organise different claims. General revelation refers to knowledge of the divine available to all through nature, conscience, reason and human experience. Many religious believers argue that the beauty, order and moral law seen in the world point to God, and that nature itself is a kind of book that reveals God’s attributes. Special revelation refers to more specific communications, such as scripture, prophetic messages, miracles and visions. Examples include the Qur’an as revealed to Muhammad, the Bible’s accounts of prophetic visions, and individual visions like Paul’s Damascus experience. In some Indian traditions and in Buddhism, enlightenment (awakening) functions as a special kind of knowledge: the experience of nirvana or awakening reveals ultimate truth directly to the practitioner. Enlightenment is not usually described as God revealing himself, but it is a form of direct insight into ultimate reality.

When evaluating revelation, consider strengths such as immediacy and life-changing power, and weaknesses such as subjectivity and lack of independent verification. Also reflect on the different kinds of authority each source claims: scripture often carries institutional authority; visions and personal experiences carry subjective authority; nature appeals to shared observation but is open to differing interpretations.

## Different concepts of the divine: attributes and variations from sources of revelation
Revelation and argument lead to different conceptions of the divine. Traditions and arguments produce descriptions such as omnipotent and omniscient, personal or impersonal, immanent or transcendent. The God of classical theism is usually described as all-powerful, all-knowing and perfectly good. Some religious experiences and scriptures present God as personal, involved with human life, listening to prayer and acting in history. Other sources suggest an impersonal ultimate reality: Brahman in some strands of Hindu thought is an impersonal absolute, while Buddhist accounts of enlightenment do not posit a creator God but point to an impersonal ultimate truth. Theological debates about immanence (God present within the world) versus transcendence (God beyond the world) shape how believers understand prayer, miracles and moral responsibility. In exam answers it is important to show how different sources produce different pictures of God and to explain the consequences of each picture for religious practice and ethics.

## Scientific and non-religious objections
Science and non-religious worldviews provide powerful challenges to theistic claims. Theories such as evolution by natural selection and models of cosmology reduce the need to posit a divine designer to explain biological complexity or cosmic origins. Philosophers and scientists also point to methodological naturalism: scientific explanations rely on testable hypotheses and repeatable evidence, and supernatural claims usually fall outside this method. Atheists and humanists argue that morality and meaning can be grounded without God and that natural explanations are sufficient. However, some religious believers adopt a complementary view, arguing that science explains how the world works while religion addresses questions of purpose and value. When you write about scientific objections, make sure to differentiate between a strictly scientific refutation (which is rare) and a philosophical critique that questions theological inferences.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Theme C, begin by identifying the command word and the assessment objective it targets. For AO1 (knowledge and understanding) questions, describe the argument, concept or example clearly and accurately, using religious language where appropriate; include brief examples such as Paley’s watch, the Kalam argument, Jesus’ miracles or Saul’s vision. For AO2 (analysis and evaluation) questions, balance your answer by presenting reasons for and against the view, and then evaluate which side is stronger. Use clear signposting in your answer: state the argument, explain how it works, give supporting examples, offer objections (Hume on miracles, Darwin on design, the problem of evil), then provide a considered judgement that summarises and justifies your conclusion.

In a 4-mark question aim for two clear points with brief explanation; in a 6-mark question develop three or four linked points with some development; in a 12-mark question plan a short introduction, two developed paragraphs arguing for and against (each supported with examples and reasons), and a concise conclusion that reaches a judgement. Make use of relevant religious vocabulary (such as omnipotence, immanence, revelation, theodicy, enlightenment) and, for the highest marks, integrate short references to scripture, sacred texts or specific religious examples where appropriate. Remember spelling, punctuation and grammar are assessed in extended answers, so write clearly and check your work. Above all, show that you can link theory to real examples and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each claim.
