# Theme D: Religion, peace and conflict (GCSE Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview and why this theme matters
Religion, peace and conflict is a theme that explores how religious beliefs shape attitudes to violence, war and the pursuit of peace. It asks you to think about big moral questions: when, if ever, is it right to use force; what makes for a just peace; how should societies respond to victims of violence; and how do religious teachings influence both causes of conflict and peacemaking? These questions are applied to contemporary British society and the wider world. In answers you will be expected to explain religious teachings (for example from Christianity and at least one other religion), analyse ethical arguments, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different positions.

## Key concepts: peace, justice, forgiveness and reconciliation
Peace in religious and ethical discussion has several senses. It can mean inner peace, a state of personal harmony or tranquillity, and it can mean social peace, the absence of violent conflict in communities or between states. Justice is closely linked: many religious traditions argue that a stable peace requires justice, not merely the absence of violence. Forgiveness is the act of letting go of resentment and an important moral response in many faiths; it can be offered personally or encouraged as part of a public process. Reconciliation goes further than forgiveness: it aims to restore broken relationships and rebuild trust after wrongdoing. In practice, restorative approaches to harm — which combine acknowledgement of wrongs, forgiveness where appropriate, and measures to repair damage — are central to many religious approaches to peace, for example in truth and reconciliation processes.

## Religion, violence and terrorism
Religions have complex relationships with violence. On the one hand, many sacred teachings emphasise compassion, non-violence and care for the vulnerable; on the other hand, religious language and identities have sometimes been used to mobilise people for violent causes. Violence here includes violent protest, civil unrest and acts of terrorism. Terrorism is widely understood as the deliberate targeting or intimidation of civilians to achieve political ends; mainstream religious organisations commonly condemn terrorism because it targets innocent people and spreads fear. When exploring causes, it is important to consider a mixture of political, economic, social and religious factors: grievances about injustice, poverty, nationalist aims, political oppression and radical interpretations of religion can all contribute. A balanced answer will recognise that religion can be used to justify violence but is often a minority factor among many causes.

## Just war, holy war and pacifism
Christian and other religious responses to the morality of war include three broad approaches: just war theory, the idea of holy war in some historical contexts, and pacifism. Just war theory, developed in the Christian tradition by thinkers such as Augustine and later Thomas Aquinas, sets conditions for morally justifiable warfare. These conditions include having a just cause, being declared by a proper authority, right intention, last resort, and proportionality; there are also rules about conduct during war, such as protecting civilians. Many Christians accept just war criteria as a way to limit harm, while others, such as Quakers and historic Anabaptist groups, adopt pacifism and argue that following Jesus’ teachings, especially the Sermon on the Mount, requires non-violence and turning the other cheek.

The concept of holy war has appeared in different religious traditions and historical settings. In Islam the notion of jihad is complex: classical teaching distinguishes between greater jihad (the internal, spiritual struggle) and lesser jihad (armed struggle under strict conditions). Mainstream Muslim scholars emphasise that any armed struggle must follow clear moral rules, such as fighting only in self-defence and not harming civilians. Similarly, Sikh teaching historically includes the idea of the saint-soldier, which allows for armed resistance to injustice in certain circumstances; this provides a contrast with purely pacifist positions. When you write answers, show how religions offer both justifications for fighting in particular conditions and strong critiques of violence.

## Weapons of mass destruction and nuclear deterrence
Weapons of mass destruction — nuclear, chemical and biological — raise particular moral problems because of their indiscriminate and catastrophic effects. Debates about nuclear weapons often centre on deterrence: the idea that possession of such weapons prevents war by threatening unacceptable retaliation. Critics argue that deterrence is morally flawed because it depends on the threat to kill huge numbers of civilians and risks accidental catastrophe. Many religious groups object strongly to WMDs because they violate the sanctity of life and the principles of discrimination and proportionality in war. In recent years major religious leaders and organisations have increasingly campaigned against nuclear arms, favouring disarmament and treaties that reduce the risk of mass civilian harm. When answering exam questions, consider both the pragmatic arguments for deterrence and the ethical arguments against the existence or use of WMDs.

## Religion and peacemaking in the twenty‑first century
Religions contribute to peacebuilding in practical and moral ways. Religious organisations and individuals often provide humanitarian relief to victims of war, support reconciliation programmes, and work in interfaith initiatives to reduce tensions. Examples include faith-based aid agencies that deliver emergency food, shelter and medical care, community groups that bring former adversaries together to tell their stories, and religious peacemakers who use moral authority to mediate conflicts. Historical examples are helpful in essays: the work of Archbishop Desmond Tutu and South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission illustrates how a faith-informed commitment to forgiveness and restorative justice can shape national healing. Similarly, the Corrymeela community in Northern Ireland has used faith-based dialogue to foster reconciliation after sectarian violence. Contemporary organisations such as Pax Christi and Christian Peacemaker Teams, and charities like Islamic Relief and CAFOD, show how religious resources are channelled into practical aid and advocacy. It is also important to recognise the limitations and criticisms of religious peacemaking, for instance where faith groups are seen as partisan or where religious identity is part of the underlying conflict.

## Responses to victims of war
How religions respond to victims is a key measure of their contribution to peace. Many faith communities emphasise the duty to care for the suffering, offering material aid, pastoral support and campaigning for justice. Religious rituals and communal support can help survivors process grief, while theological frameworks (such as beliefs about compassion, redemption or karma) shape how communities understand suffering. Ethical questions arise about prioritising aid, dealing with trauma, and whether forgiveness should be expected of victims. In your answers, evaluate both the strengths of religious responses — provision of long‑term support, moral leadership in forgiveness and reconciliation — and possible weaknesses, such as when religious rhetoric pressures victims to forgive before justice is served.

## Contrasting religious teachings — Christianity and other religions
A strong answer will compare Christian teachings with those from at least one other religion. Christianity offers a range of views: Jesus’ teachings in the Gospels support non-violence and forgiveness, yet the Christian tradition also contains a just war theory. Catholic teaching has historically accepted just war conditions and, more recently, expressed growing unease with nuclear deterrence and total war; many Protestant denominations and nonconformist groups are staunchly pacifist. In Islam, classical sources permit fighting in self-defence with strict ethical limits and emphasise protection of civilians; contemporary Muslim scholars generally condemn terrorism and the targeting of innocents. Buddhism highlights compassion (karuna) and non-harm (ahimsa) as central, which leads many Buddhists to oppose violence, though there are historical exceptions where Buddhists have supported conflict. Sikhism’s ideal of the saint-soldier allows armed defence against oppression while also valuing justice and service. Use these contrasts to show that religions are not monolithic: they contain resources for both peace and, in some readings, for justified force.

## Exam technique
Answer the question directly and plan your response. For 12-mark evaluation questions, spend time explaining relevant religious teachings, apply them to the issue, and then analyse strengths and weaknesses before reaching a reasoned conclusion. Use specific teachings or concepts (for example, Sermon on the Mount, just war criteria, jihad as greater and lesser) and give at least one clear example or contemporary case to illustrate your point. Compare viewpoints from Christianity and at least one other religion when the question asks for contrasting beliefs. Balance description (AO1) with analysis and evaluation (AO2): description shows knowledge of beliefs and teachings, while analysis weighs arguments, considers implications, and reaches a supported judgement. Finally, write clearly, structure paragraphs logically, and aim to include accurate religious vocabulary and some brief, well‑chosen examples to show the relevance of beliefs to real-world conflicts.
