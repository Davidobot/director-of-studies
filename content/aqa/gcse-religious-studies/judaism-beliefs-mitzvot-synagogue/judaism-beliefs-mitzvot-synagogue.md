# Judaism: beliefs, mitzvot and synagogue life (GCSE Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Key beliefs about God, the world and humanity
Judaism is a monotheistic faith centred on the belief in one God who is both transcendent and immanent: beyond the world yet present within it and in human life. Jews describe God with attributes such as unity, justice, mercy and creator of all things. The divine presence, often called the Shekhinah, expresses the idea that God dwells among the people; this helps explain why sacred spaces and communal worship are so important. Jewish belief about human beings stresses moral responsibility: humans are created in the image of God and so life has intrinsic dignity and value. Different Jewish groups share these core beliefs, though they may interpret the nature of God and how God acts in the world in varying ways.

Beliefs about life after death and the Messiah vary within Judaism. Many traditional Jews expect a future age of peace and the coming of a Messiah (Mashiach) who will restore Israel and bring justice; here views differ on whether the Messiah will be an individual leader or a symbolic era of redemption. Ideas about the afterlife include concepts of Olam Ha-Ba (the World to Come), resurrection of the dead, and a temporary purgatorial process (sometimes called Gehinnom), but Jewish teaching often focuses more on correct living in this world than on detailed descriptions of the afterlife.

## The Covenant, Torah and the mitzvot
A central idea in Judaism is the Covenant: a binding relationship between God and the people of Israel, first promised to Abraham and later confirmed at Sinai to Moses. The stories of Genesis and Exodus (for example, the promise to Abraham and the giving of the Ten Commandments at Sinai) form the scriptural foundation for Jewish identity and obligation. The Covenant involves promises from God and responsibilities for the people, expressed as mitzvot, the commandments.

Traditionally Judaism teaches that there are 613 mitzvot, a mixture of positive commands (things to do) and negative commands (things to avoid), covering ritual, ethical and social life. These mitzvot are often discussed as falling into two broad categories: those between man and God (bein adam la-Makom), such as prayer, observing festivals and dietary laws; and those between people (bein adam le-chavero), such as justice, charity and kindness. Ethical mitzvot — for instance pursuing justice, caring for the poor and the command to “love your neighbour” — are central to Jewish religious life. The principle of Pikuach Nefesh, which prioritises saving a life above almost all other commandments, shows how Jewish law balances rules with ethical imperatives in real situations.

Authority in Judaism is rooted in the Written Torah (the Five Books of Moses) and the Oral Torah, preserved in collections such as the Mishnah and the Talmud. The Talmud contains rabbinic debate and legal interpretation which guide how mitzvot are understood and applied. Over centuries, rabbinic responsa and later codes have helped Jewish communities adapt ancient commandments to new circumstances while retaining continuity with tradition.

## How beliefs shape daily life and ethics
Beliefs and mitzvot shape Jewish personal and communal life in practical ways. Observance of Shabbat (the Sabbath), dietary laws (kashrut), prayer routines and charity are not only rituals but also expressions of core values. Shabbat, from Friday evening to Saturday night, is a weekly reminder of creation and covenantal rest; keeping it involves communal synagogue attendance, family meals and refraining from certain types of work. Kashrut governs what foods are permitted, how animals are slaughtered (shechita), and the separation of meat and dairy; these rules cultivate a constant awareness of religious identity and ethical restraint.

Jewish ethical teachings encourage action in the world. The obligation of tzedakah (charitable giving) and the concept of tikkun olam (repairing the world) motivate community work, social justice initiatives and responses to crises. For example, many Jewish communities support food banks, refugee aid, and education projects in line with the command to pursue justice and compassion. These practical expressions help students understand how belief informs behaviour and shapes communal priorities.

## The synagogue, worship and religious practice
The synagogue is the focal point of communal worship, education and social life, and its layout reflects religious priorities. The ark (aron hakodesh) holds the Torah scrolls and is often the most ornate feature; it faces Jerusalem and is covered by a curtain called the parochet. The bimah, a raised platform, is where the Torah is read; the physical act of reading from the Torah and giving aliyot (honours) strengthens communal participation. The ner tamid, the ever‑burning light, symbolises the continuous divine presence and the enduring covenant.

Public worship is characterised by fixed prayers and communal responses. The Amidah, or Standing Prayer, is central to daily services and expresses praise, petition and thanksgiving. The Kaddish, a sanctification prayer recited by mourners, demonstrates how liturgy supports life-cycle events and communal solidarity. Torah reading takes place on Shabbat and festivals with specific portions (parashot) assigned to each week; study of the Torah and the wider Tenakh and Talmud is an ongoing spiritual discipline. Practices vary between Orthodox, Reform and Liberal synagogues: Orthodox services are traditionally in Hebrew, men and women may be seated separately, and there is strict observance of ritual laws, whereas Reform and Liberal communities often use a mixture of Hebrew and the vernacular, have mixed seating, and adapt rituals to contemporary contexts.

## Life-cycle rituals: birth, coming of age, marriage and mourning
Jewish life is marked at key moments by rituals that connect individuals to community and covenant. A male baby is traditionally circumcised in the brit milah on the eighth day as a sign of the covenant with Abraham; for girls, naming ceremonies in the synagogue or home affirm inclusion in community life. The bar mitzvah (for boys) and bat mitzvah (for girls) mark the age when a young person becomes responsible for the mitzvot; the ceremony usually involves leading part of the service or reading from the Torah and is often followed by a celebration. While bar mitzvah at thirteen is a long-standing custom, the precise practices and ages for girls have varied historically and differ among movements.

Marriage is solemnised under a chuppah (wedding canopy) with the signing of a ketubah (marriage contract) that outlines mutual responsibilities. Jewish mourning rituals include sitting shiva (a seven‑day period of mourning at home), saying the Kaddish and visiting graves; these practices combine communal support with theological reflection on life and loss. Rituals are both religiously meaningful and sociologically important: they publicly affirm identity, transmit values across generations, and give structure to major life events.

## Festivals and the Jewish calendar
The Jewish year is shaped by festivals that recall historical events and reinforce theological themes. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, form the High Holy Days: a period of reflection, repentance and communal prayer. Rosh Hashanah features the sounding of the shofar (ram’s horn) to awaken conscience, while Yom Kippur is a fast day dedicated to confession and reconciliation. Pesach (Passover) commemorates the Exodus from Egypt and emphasises liberation through the ritual Seder meal, removal of chametz (leavened products) and the retelling of the freedom story. Each festival combines liturgy, family rituals and ethical reflection, and in Britain many Jews balance tradition with modern life, sometimes adapting observance to contemporary schedules.

Festivals also reveal differences within Judaism: Orthodox Jews tend to observe traditional restrictions more strictly (for example, refraining from driving on Shabbat or festival days), while Reform and Liberal communities may permit driving to services and reinterpret some symbolic practices to suit contemporary sensibilities. Studying festivals helps students see how theology, history and culture interact in lived religion.

## Jewish law, texts and interpretation
Jewish religious authority rests on texts and interpretation. The Written Law (Torah) provides foundational narratives and commandments, while the Oral Law—recorded in the Mishnah and amplified in the Talmud—offers legal argument and ethical reasoning. Rabbis across centuries have engaged in halakhah (Jewish law), issuing responsa and legal rulings that apply ancient commandments to new circumstances. This process demonstrates a dynamic tradition in which continuity and change coexist.

Study of these texts is not merely academic; it shapes everyday choices about worship, diet, business conduct and justice. Different movements give different weight to textual authority: Orthodox Judaism emphasizes strict adherence to halakhah, whereas Reform and Liberal Judaism grant greater authority to individual conscience and modern values, leading to differing practices on issues such as egalitarianism, interfaith marriage and ritual adaptation.

## Diversity within Judaism in modern Britain
British Judaism is diverse, encompassing Orthodox, Modern Orthodox, Conservative (Masorti), Reform, Liberal and secular Jewish identities. This diversity affects theology, ritual practice and communal life. For example, Orthodox synagogues typically maintain separate seating for men and women and a full commitment to halakhic standards, while Reform and Liberal communities often practice gender equality in ritual roles and make liturgical changes. On social issues such as same‑sex marriage, responses vary: some communities oppose it on halakhic grounds, others have embraced inclusion.

Understanding these differences is vital for GCSE study because exam questions often ask students to explain contrasting beliefs and practices. Exploring contemporary examples—such as debates over driving to synagogue on Shabbat, the inclusion of women in the rabbinate, or communal responses to poverty—helps students show how timeless teachings continue to influence modern Jewish life.

## Exam technique
When answering AQA GCSE questions on Judaism you must show both clear factual knowledge (AO1) and the ability to analyse and evaluate (AO2). For short recall questions, be precise: define terms like mitzvot, Shekhinah, Pikuach Nefesh and give a brief example. For 4‑ and 6‑mark questions explain beliefs or practices and include a source or example, such as referencing the Covenant with Abraham when discussing covenantal promises or describing the ark and bimah when explaining synagogue features. Always mention differences between Orthodox and Reform where relevant to show understanding of diversity.

For 12‑mark evaluation questions, set out arguments for and against, refer to teachings or texts (for example, Exodus 20 and the Ten Commandments when discussing moral law) and draw a balanced conclusion. Use clear paragraphing: one paragraph to explain a belief or practice, another to show its significance for individuals and communities, a third to present an alternative view or limitation, and a final paragraph to weigh the evidence and answer the question directly. Include specific examples—such as how Pikuach Nefesh allows driving on Shabbat to save a life—to illustrate how Jewish law is applied. Remember to manage time: allocate around one third of the time to the long questions and practise planning short introductions to your extended answers. Check your spelling and grammar, and use specialist terms appropriately; up to three SPaG marks are available, so clear expression and technical accuracy matter.
