# Theme E: Religion, crime and punishment (GCSE Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Overview: what this theme covers and why it matters
Theme E looks at how religions understand crime, why people commit crimes, what counts as good and evil, and how society should respond to wrongdoing. It asks big moral questions that shape law and public debate: should punishment be about revenge or reform? Is it ever right to take a life in response to murder? How far should forgiveness play a role in justice? These questions are tested by asking you to describe religious teachings (AO1) and to analyse and evaluate their significance or persuasiveness (AO2). In answers you should show both knowledge of specific teachings and awareness of the modern British context, where laws, human rights and diverse beliefs influence how these issues are discussed.

## Causes of crime and religious perspectives on good and evil
Understanding why people commit crimes helps to decide how to respond. Explanations include social factors such as poverty, poor upbringing or lack of education; psychological causes including mental illness or addiction; and moral motives such as greed, hatred or deliberate opposition to an unjust law. Religions approach the question of good and evil in different ways. Christianity often speaks about sin and moral choice, recognising both social causes and individual responsibility; teachings emphasise that humans are capable of both good and evil and therefore need moral guidance and transformation. Islam also stresses moral accountability and free will, while insisting that social justice and fair treatment reduce crime. Buddhism frames harmful actions in terms of ignorance and unskilful states of mind: greed, hatred and delusion are the Three Poisons that lead to harmful karma. These religious frameworks affect whether believers and religious institutions focus on punishment, prevention, or rehabilitation.

## Aims and theories of punishment
Punishment can be justified in several different ways and modern criminal systems combine more than one aim. Retribution argues that wrongdoers deserve to suffer proportionately; it appeals to a moral sense of justice but can be criticised as vengeful. Deterrence aims to put people off committing crimes by making the cost high, whether through publicised sentences or stricter penalties. Protection focuses on keeping society safe by removing dangerous individuals from the community. Reformation (or rehabilitation) seeks to change offenders so they can return to society as law‑abiding citizens. Finally, restoration or restitution tries to repair harm to victims and communities. Religious thinkers differ in which aim they prioritise. Many Christian thinkers and churches emphasise forgiveness and reformation, arguing that punishment should lead to moral renewal and reconciliation, while some readings of scripture and historic practice have supported retribution. Islamic teaching contains elements of retribution (for example in the legal concept of qisas, retaliation) alongside strong emphasis on mercy, forgiveness and the possibility of repentance. Evaluating these aims well in exam answers means showing how each responds to practical issues, such as the risk of wrongful conviction, the cost of imprisonment and the needs of victims.

## Treatment of criminals: prisons, corporal punishment and alternatives
How a society treats offenders is judged morally as well as legally. Modern Britain relies mainly on custodial sentences, with prisons intended to punish, protect and rehabilitate. However, overcrowding, reoffending rates and the mental health of prisoners have led to debate about the effectiveness of prisons. Alternatives include community sentences, fines, restorative justice practices where victims meet offenders, education and therapy programmes aimed at reducing reoffending. Corporal punishment — physical punishment such as flogging or caning — has been used historically but is no longer acceptable in British criminal law and is widely opposed by human rights institutions; it is still used in some countries, and religious attitudes vary. Christian responses often emphasise the dignity and rehabilitation of the offender, drawing on teachings about mercy and the worth of every person, although some Christians have historically accepted corporal or harsh punishments. Islamic practice historically includes corporal measures within a legal framework, but modern Muslim-majority countries differ widely in application and there are frequent calls for humane treatment and due process. Buddhist ethics, centred on compassion and reducing suffering, generally supports rehabilitative measures rather than humiliating or purely violent punishments.

## The death penalty: arguments for and against and religious views
The death penalty is one of the most contested issues in this theme. Arguments in favour include retribution (that some crimes, especially murder, deserve the ultimate punishment) and deterrence (that the threat of death will prevent others from committing severe crimes). Arguments against focus on the sanctity of life, the possibility of executing an innocent person, the lack of strong evidence that capital punishment reduces crime, and the idea that the state should not be in the business of killing. In Britain the death penalty for murder was abolished and public policy reflects a widespread commitment to abolition. Christian views are mixed historically, but many contemporary Christian denominations oppose capital punishment on grounds of the sanctity of life, the potential for repentance and the emphasis on forgiveness; the Roman Catholic Church in recent decades has stated that the death penalty is inadmissible. Islamic teaching includes provisions that have been interpreted as allowing capital punishment in certain cases (for example, qisas for murder), but it also stresses strict evidentiary requirements, the value of repentance and the permissibility of forgiveness or financial compensation (diyya) in place of execution. Buddhists are generally opposed on the basis of non‑violence and the value of compassion, preferring methods that offer the chance for moral change.

## Forgiveness, repentance and restorative justice
Religious traditions place strong emphasis on forgiveness and the possibility of repentance, yet they do not always expect forgiveness to eliminate the need for justice. In Christianity, forgiveness is central: Jesus teaches forgiveness repeatedly and the Lord’s Prayer asks God to “forgive us our trespasses,” implying that believers should also forgive others. Parables such as the Unforgiving Servant and teachings about loving enemies show that forgiveness is a moral ideal, but Christian thought also allows for justice and protection when harm is done. Islam similarly values forgiveness and mercy, with God described as Most Merciful; at the same time, Islamic legal theory provides mechanisms for both punishment and reconciliation. Buddhism emphasises compassion, metta (loving-kindness) and the need to transform unwholesome states of mind; forgiveness is a means of freeing oneself from hatred rather than condoning wrongdoing. Restorative justice is a practical approach that reflects many religious values: it recognises victims’ needs, holds offenders accountable, and invests in repairing relationships. Examples such as victim‑offender mediation show how restorative processes can complement or replace traditional punishment while honouring both justice and compassion.

## Ethics and contemporary British context
When answering exam questions, it helps to relate religious teachings to contemporary British society and law. Concepts such as human rights, the rule of law and equality before the law shape how crime and punishment are practised in the UK. Debates in Britain touch on real issues: whether harsher sentences reduce crime, how to support victims, how to prevent radicalisation in prisons, and how to balance security with civil liberties. Ethical approaches that you should be able to use include utilitarianism (doing what produces the greatest overall good) and the sanctity of life (life has intrinsic value). For example, a utilitarian argument in favour of tough sentences might be that they deter crime and protect the public, while a sanctity‑of‑life argument against the death penalty would insist that taking a life is wrong irrespective of consequences. In exam answers, showing awareness of practicalities — such as miscarriages of justice, the costs of imprisonment, and successful rehabilitation programmes — will strengthen your evaluation.

## Exam technique
In this theme you will encounter the standard question structure used on the AQA papers: each theme question is divided into five parts worth 1, 1, 4, 6 and 12 marks. The first two one‑mark questions usually ask for short, precise facts or definitions and should take only a minute or two each. The four‑mark question asks you to describe or explain beliefs and teachings (AO1); write two or three short paragraphs, each focused on a different teaching or example, and include a brief reference to a source of wisdom such as a scripture or named teaching. The six‑mark question requires more explanation or comparison; organise your answer with clear points and short development of each point. For the twelve‑mark question you need both AO1 and AO2: start by outlining relevant teachings and evidence, then analyse strengths and weaknesses or provide a reasoned argument, and finish with a brief conclusion that answers the question directly. Use specific religious ideas from Christianity and at least one other tradition (for example Islam or Buddhism) and apply them to the question. Always aim for balance in the 12‑mark answer by presenting both supporting and opposing views before reaching a considered judgement. Time management is crucial: roughly allocate time in proportion to marks, leave a few minutes to check spelling, punctuation and grammar, and ensure you meet the SPaG criteria by writing clearly and using specialist vocabulary appropriately. Finally, where possible bring in contemporary examples or legal context to show the real‑world relevance of religious teachings; examiners value precise, well‑supported, balanced responses that demonstrate both knowledge and evaluation.
