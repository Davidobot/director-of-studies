# Theme B: Religion and life (bioethics & environment) (GCSE Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Key ideas and overview
Theme B asks you to think about where the world and human life come from, what makes life valuable, and how people should treat other living things and the environment. It brings together religious teachings, scientific accounts and moral reasoning to tackle practical questions such as whether abortion or euthanasia can ever be justified, how to balance care for the planet with human needs, and whether animals may be used in experiments. When you study this theme, try to keep a twofold aim in mind: first, to explain clearly what different religions teach; second, to evaluate those beliefs by showing awareness of strengths, weaknesses and contemporary implications. Use specific religious ideas and real-world examples to show how beliefs influence choices.

## Origins of the universe and human life
Religious traditions offer a range of accounts about how the universe and human life began, from literal readings of sacred texts to symbolic or theological interpretations. Many Christians read the Genesis creation stories as revealing God as Creator and see the world as having intrinsic purpose and design; others accept scientific accounts such as the Big Bang and interpret scripture in non-literal ways, seeing God as working through natural processes. In Islam the idea of God as Creator is central and is often combined with respect for scientific enquiry. Hinduism and Buddhism have different cosmologies, with cycles of creation and rebirth rather than a single creation moment, and concepts such as karma shaping rebirth. Science explains origins through theories like the Big Bang for the universe and evolution by natural selection for life; some religious believers integrate these scientific accounts with faith, while others feel they challenge traditional readings of scripture. Understanding how religions relate revelation and science helps explain why followers take particular ethical positions about human identity and the natural world.

## The value of the world and environmental ethics
Religious teachings give distinct reasons for caring for the environment. Many Christians use the language of stewardship, arguing that humans have a responsibility to care for God’s creation rather than exploit it, although some interpret earlier texts to justify dominion — the idea that humans may use natural resources for human benefit. In Islam the concept of humans as khalifah, or stewards on earth, supports environmental responsibility and the idea that creation should be treated with balance and respect. Hinduism teaches reverence for the divine in nature, with many rivers, trees and animals considered sacred, which encourages conservation. Buddhism emphasises interdependence and compassion for all sentient beings, encouraging lifestyles that avoid harm. These religious foundations have concrete implications: they motivate environmental projects, support conservation, and inform debates about pollution, use of resources and climate change. Teaching examples might include faith groups organising tree-planting, supporting renewable energy, or campaigns against excessive waste, showing how belief leads to practical action.

## Use and abuse of animals, including animal experimentation
Religions vary in how they view animals and whether using them for food, work or research is acceptable. Hindu and Jain ideas of non-violence (ahimsa) encourage vegetarianism and great care for animals. Buddhism’s emphasis on compassion also tends to oppose unnecessary harm to animals. In Judaism and Islam, animals are created by God and may be used for food, but ethical rules govern slaughter and treatment; unnecessary cruelty is prohibited. Christianity has a range of views from stewardship with responsible use to vegetarian or animal-friendly interpretations. When it comes to animal experimentation the debate balances possible human benefits, such as medical advances, against the moral status of animals and duties to avoid causing suffering. Secular ethical approaches include utilitarian reasoning that weighs overall benefits versus harms, and rights-based arguments that either grant moral status to certain animals or deny it. In practice, many countries require that animal research follow strict regulations and the principles of replace, reduce and refine, which aim to replace animals where possible, reduce numbers used and refine procedures to minimise suffering. Classroom discussion can use case studies such as testing vaccines, considering both the potential to save human lives and the suffering caused to animals, and asking how different religious teachings would influence a researcher's decisions.

## Abortion: sanctity of life and quality of life
Abortion is one of the most emotionally charged topics in Theme B. Central to many religious responses is the idea of the sanctity of life: the belief that life is sacred because it is God-given, which often leads to strong objections to deliberately ending an unborn life. For example, many Roman Catholics regard abortion as morally wrong in almost all circumstances, reflecting a strong sanctity-of-life stance. Other Christian traditions may also value life highly but allow greater exceptions, especially when the mother's life is at risk. In Islam life is sacred and abortion is generally discouraged, but many Muslim scholars permit abortion in early pregnancy or when the mother's life is endangered, showing variation in how sanctity is applied. Judaism tends to prioritise the life and health of the mother, allowing abortion where her life is at risk and sometimes in other serious circumstances. Secular ethical arguments often raise the quality of life issue: whether it is humane to allow a life of severe suffering or whether the rights and autonomy of the pregnant woman should take precedence. Legal frameworks, such as the law in the UK, set time limits and specify circumstances in which abortion is permitted; these laws interact with religious views and shape real choices in healthcare. When discussing abortion, it helps to be precise about what is being debated: questions about personhood (when a fetus becomes a person), the rights of the mother, and circumstances like rape, foetal anomaly or threat to maternal life can all lead to different moral conclusions.

## Euthanasia and end-of-life ethics
Euthanasia and assisted dying raise questions about whether it is ever right to end a life intentionally to relieve suffering. Distinctions matter: active euthanasia involves deliberately administering something to cause death, while passive euthanasia involves withdrawing or withholding treatment that sustains life; voluntary euthanasia is performed at the patient's request, whereas non-voluntary involves someone incapable of consenting. Many religious traditions oppose active euthanasia because it seems to contradict the sanctity of life and the belief that only God should decide when life ends. For example, mainstream Christian and Islamic teachings typically reject both active euthanasia and assisted suicide, while allowing palliative care and sometimes passive measures when treatment is burdensome and futile. Some religious traditions and secular ethicists emphasise compassion and autonomy: they argue that allowing a person to choose a short, peaceful death can respect their dignity and relieve unbearable suffering. Medical ethics also considers the principle of double effect, where an action intended to relieve pain may have a foreseeable but unintended consequence of hastening death; many accept this in palliative care when the primary intention is pain relief. Classroom debate should explore real scenarios such as terminal illness with uncontrolled pain, asking how religious teachings, legal restrictions and medical practice interact.

## Religious responses in practice and case studies
Understanding abstract teachings becomes easier when you look at how communities act. Christian hospitals and hospices often provide palliative care rooted in compassion and respect for life, while Catholic ethics influences policies such as opposition to active euthanasia. Muslim chaplaincy in hospitals may emphasise family consultation and preserving life, with attention to allowing natural death when treatment is futile. Buddhist approaches often focus on compassion and the intention behind actions; while opposing deliberate killing, some Buddhists may be sympathetic to reducing suffering and emphasise the importance of intention. Hindu practice can involve rituals and family decision-making that reflect karma and the sanctity of life. Jewish medical ethics frequently highlights pikuach nefesh, the duty to save life, which can permit strong measures to preserve a life but also acknowledges that in certain contexts withdrawing treatment can be allowed. Teaching with concrete case studies, such as a pregnant woman whose life is endangered, a patient with degenerative disease requesting assistance to die, or a pharmaceutical firm conducting animal research for a potential cure, helps students apply teachings and see the tensions between principles like sanctity, compassion, autonomy and the common good.

## Ethical arguments and secular perspectives
Alongside religious views, secular ethical theories provide tools for analysis. Utilitarianism focuses on consequences and may justify actions that maximise overall well-being, supporting interventions like some forms of animal research if benefits outweigh harms, or favouring assisted dying to relieve suffering. Rights-based theories emphasise individual autonomy and may support a woman's right to choose abortion or a competent adult's right to decide about their own death. Natural law and deontological ethics stress moral rules and duties, often aligning with religious objections to killing. Philosophical questions about personhood, moral status, and the meaning of suffering shape arguments on both sides. Recognising these different frameworks allows students to evaluate religious teachings in dialogue with broader moral reasoning and to explain why people with similar starting beliefs may reach different conclusions.

## Exam technique
When answering Theme B questions, always be clear which part of the syllabus you are addressing and whether your response is AO1 (knowledge and understanding) or AO2 (analysis and evaluation). For short answer marks, give precise factual points and, where appropriate, a short example. For longer AO1 answers, explain religious teachings and quote or refer to a specific source of wisdom or authority where possible, showing how beliefs lead to particular actions. For AO2 evaluation questions, assess strengths and weaknesses, offer counter-arguments, and reach a supported judgement. Make use of religious and non-religious perspectives for balance; for example, contrast sanctity of life arguments with quality of life or autonomy-based arguments and explain which you find more convincing and why. Use case studies to illustrate abstract principles, for instance a terminally ill patient requesting assistance to die or a pregnant woman whose life is threatened, and show how different traditions would respond. Structure your 12-mark answers: start with a clear introduction, develop balanced points with evidence, include at least one developed counter-argument, and end with a justified conclusion. Remember that up to three SPaG marks are available in extended answers, so write clearly, check spelling and punctuation, and use specialist terms correctly.
