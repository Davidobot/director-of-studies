# Islam: beliefs and practices (Sunni & Shi'a) (GCSE Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction and context
Islam is one of the major world religions and a significant faith tradition in Britain today. It began in seventh‑century Arabia with the revelation received by Muhammad and is based on the belief in one God, Allah. Muslims follow guidance found in the Qur’an and in the teachings and example of Muhammad (the Sunnah). Although Muslims share many core beliefs and practices, there are important differences in emphasis and organisation between the two main branches, Sunni and Shi’a. Understanding both the shared foundations and the points of divergence helps explain how beliefs shape worship, personal morality and community life in different Muslim communities.

## Key beliefs: God, tawhid and divine attributes
The central doctrine of Islam is tawhid, the Oneness of God. Tawhid affirms that Allah is uniquely one, without partner or equal, and that nothing in creation shares God’s divine nature. Short chapters of the Qur’an such as Surah 112 are often used to summarise this teaching in simple, memorable terms. Muslims describe God with attributes such as omnipotence, mercy and justice. For many Shi’a Muslims the concept of divine justice (Adalat) is especially important and is emphasised as one of the fundamental principles that shows God’s fairness in human affairs. Alongside this, Muslims reflect on God’s immanence — God’s closeness to creation — and God’s transcendence — God’s greatness beyond everything created.

## Sources of authority: Qur’an, Hadith and leadership
Muslims regard the Qur’an as the primary source of guidance: it is believed to be the revealed word of God conveyed to Muhammad. The Hadith literature, collections of sayings and actions of the Prophet, and the Sunnah, his way of life, are also central for interpreting the Qur’an and for practical guidance. Sunnis and Shi’as both use Qur’an and Hadith but differ over which hadith collections and which religious authorities have the final interpretative role. For Sunnis the consensus of the community and scholars (ulama) helps determine authoritative interpretation, while for Twelver Shi’a Islam the role of the Imamate — the line of divinely appointed leaders beginning with Ali, Muhammad’s cousin and son‑in‑law — is a defining feature. The Imams are seen by many Shi’a as both spiritual guides and interpreters of scripture, which shapes law, ritual and community identity.

## Prophethood, angels and life after death
Islam teaches that God has sent prophets (risalah) to guide humanity, with Adam, Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) among those acknowledged, and Muhammad as the final prophet. Angels are spiritual beings who carry out God’s commands; Jibril (Gabriel) is the angel most closely associated with revelation. Muslims also believe in life after death: humans will be resurrected and judged by God on the Day of Judgment. Belief in the afterlife encourages moral responsibility and accountability; heaven and hell are understood as the ultimate consequences of how people live. Views about predestination (qadr) and human free will vary. Many Sunni traditions accept that God knows and ordains much yet hold human beings responsible for their choices, while Shi’a emphasis on divine justice often supports a stronger affirmation of human moral responsibility.

## The Five Pillars and Shi’a practices: worship in daily life
Islamic practice is commonly organised around core duties that shape daily life. For Sunnis the Five Pillars — the Shahadah (declaration of faith), Salah (prayer), Zakah (almsgiving), Sawm (fasting in Ramadan) and Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) — form the foundation of worship and community responsibility. Shahadah expresses belief in one God and in Muhammad as God’s messenger and is the statement that makes one a Muslim. Salah structures the day with five formal prayers, performed with ritual preparation including wudu (ablution), specific bodily postures and recitations. Zakah is an annual obligation to give a set proportion of savings to help those in need; it underlines the duty to care for others and to reduce inequality. Sawm during Ramadan commemorates the first revelations of the Qur’an and is a time of spiritual reflection, self‑discipline and communal breaking of the fast; the Night of Power (Laylat al‑Qadr), mentioned in early Qur’anic revelation, is especially important. Hajj brings Muslims from across the world to the Ka’aba in Makkah in a sequence of rituals that recall key events in the history of the faith.

Shi’a Islam shares these core practices but also includes particular duties known as the Ten Obligatory Acts and the practice of Khums. The Ten Obligatory Acts incorporate the Five Pillars and add duties like enjoining good and forbidding wrong, and loyalty to the Ahl al‑Bayt (the Prophet’s family). Khums is a yearly tax of one‑fifth on certain types of profit or unused wealth and has a religious and communal role in Shi’a practice. There are also observable differences in ritual detail: many Shi’a combine certain prayers into three time periods, some place a small clay tablet (turbah) made from holy soil on which they prostrate, and some Shi’a include an explicit reference to Ali when teaching about religious leadership. These variations are meaningful for identity and ritual practice but do not change the shared commitment to tawhid and to core patterns of worship.

## Festivals, commemorations and the role of Ashura
Festivals mark the religious calendar and shape communal life. Eid‑ul‑Fitr celebrates the end of Ramadan and is a time of prayer, family meals and charity; Eid‑ul‑Adha commemorates Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice and is connected to the rites of Hajj. Ashura has different meanings across traditions: for many Sunni Muslims it is a day associated with fasting and with the historical deliverance of Moses, while for Shi’a Muslims Ashura is primarily a solemn commemoration of the martyrdom of Husayn, the Prophet’s grandson, at Karbala. The remembrance of Karbala through mourning rituals, processions and majalis (gatherings) is central to Shi’a religious memory and has shaped Shi’a theology of suffering, justice and resistance to oppression. These festival and commemorative practices show how history, scripture and community memory interact in religious life.

## Ethics, community life and contemporary Britain
Islamic teachings guide personal ethics and social responsibilities. Concepts such as justice, compassion, charity (zakat and voluntary sadaqah), hospitality and care for family are central. The idea of the ummah — a community of believers — encourages mutual support, while the emphasis on social justice has led many Muslim organisations to be active in British civic life through food banks, charity work, interfaith dialogue and campaigning on issues like poverty and discrimination. Mosques function not only as places of worship but also as community centres, offering education, social services and spaces for debate. In a plural society, Muslims in Britain negotiate how to live faithfully while engaging with laws and values of the wider society; this produces a range of responses and attitudes, from conservative to liberal, across both Sunni and Shi’a communities.

## Jihad, law and moral limits of violence
Jihad is a term with several meanings. At its broadest it refers to striving in the way of God, which can mean personal spiritual struggle to live well and ethically. In classical and modern discussions jihad can also mean defensive warfare under strict ethical restrictions. Muslim thinkers differentiate “greater” jihad — the inner moral struggle — from “lesser” jihad — armed struggle that must meet conditions including legitimate authority, just cause and proportionality. The Qur’an and later legal and ethical writings set out restraints such as protection of civilians, treatment of prisoners and prohibitions against senseless destruction. Debates about the use of violence, terrorism and legitimate resistance are important contemporary topics, and Muslim ethical teachings are often invoked in public discussions about when violence can, if ever, be justified.

## Sunni and Shi’a differences in belief and authority
While Sunni and Shi’a share the fundamentals of Islam, their historical split after the death of Muhammad led to different understandings of religious authority. Sunnis developed systems of communal leadership and scholarly consensus with caliphs and jurists playing leading roles. Shi’a Muslims developed the doctrine of the Imamate, which holds that certain members of the Prophet’s family were divinely chosen leaders whose authority includes spiritual and interpretative functions. This difference affects theology (for example, the Shi’a emphasis on Adalat), ritual practice (features of prayer and mourning), religious law and community organisation. It also influences how sacred history is remembered: events such as Karbala are central to Shi’a collective identity. Both traditions, however, draw on Qur’an and Hadith, care for the needy, and emphasise worship and moral conduct.

## Exam technique
When answering GCSE exam questions on Islam you should begin by identifying whether the question is testing AO1 (knowledge and understanding) or AO2 (analysis and evaluation), or both. For AO1 answers give clear definitions and accurate facts: explain key terms such as tawhid, Shahadah, Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj, Imamate and Khums, and support definitions with brief references to sources such as the Qur’an or well‑known teachings. For AO2 answers analyse meanings, show how beliefs influence behaviour, and evaluate viewpoints by comparing Sunni and Shi’a positions or by considering alternative interpretations. Use examples to illustrate points: describe how Ramadan shapes a Muslim’s day or how Ashura is commemorated in Shi’a communities. When asked to give your own opinion, explain your reasoning and show awareness of opposing views.

Structure your answers: for a short answer give a clear direct response; for a 6‑mark question provide two developed points with explanation; for a 12‑mark question write a balanced response with definition, development and evaluation. Make sure to include specific religious teachings or practices as evidence and explain their significance. Time management is crucial: plan answers briefly, write clearly, and leave time to check spelling, punctuation and grammar. Finally, remember to address the question directly — focus on the command word (describe, explain, analyse or evaluate) — and where appropriate, make explicit comparisons between Sunni and Shi’a beliefs and practices to demonstrate broader understanding.
