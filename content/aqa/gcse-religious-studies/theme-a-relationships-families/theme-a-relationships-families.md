# Theme A: Relationships and families (GCSE Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Introduction: why this theme matters
Theme A explores how religions and non-religious worldviews understand intimate human relationships, marriage and family life. These topics are central to personal identity and social policy in contemporary Britain, where law, culture and belief interact. The theme asks you to explain religious teachings, show how they influence believers and communities, and evaluate ethical arguments about contraception, sexual relationships, same-sex relationships, marriage, divorce and roles within the family. For exam success you need clear knowledge (AO1) and the ability to analyse and argue (AO2), using religious sources and contemporary examples to support points.

## Contraception: religious teachings and practical considerations
Contraception is the deliberate prevention of pregnancy and raises questions about the purposes of sex, the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of couples. Within Christianity there is diversity. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that artificial contraception is morally wrong because it separates the procreative and unitive purposes of sex; Natural Family Planning, which works with the body’s natural cycles, is accepted. Many Protestant denominations and most mainstream Anglican churches accept the use of contraception as a responsible way to plan family life and safeguard health, arguing that sex serves both unitive and procreative purposes and that responsible parenthood is a moral good. In Islam, classical jurists generally permit contraception provided there is mutual consent between spouses and it does not permanently prevent procreation; the emphasis is on protecting the family and the welfare of existing children. Non-religious perspectives, such as humanism, tend to favour contraception on grounds of autonomy, health and social responsibility.

When you revise, remember the ethical arguments on both sides. Opponents often appeal to natural law or religious teachings about procreation and the sanctity of life; supporters emphasise personal conscience, the quality of parental care, social consequences and public health. Practical British contexts you could use as examples include family planning services, debates about school sex education and religious healthcare provision.

## Sexual relationships before marriage and same-sex relationships: contrasting views
Religious responses to premarital sex and same-sex relationships vary widely and have evolved over time. Traditional teachings in many religions place sexual activity within marriage. In Christianity, conservative readings of scripture and long-standing church teaching discourage premarital sex and hold that sexual relationships belong in marriage, although Anglican and many Protestant communities now take a range of views, with some accepting stable, loving relationships outside marriage and affirming same-sex partnerships. Roman Catholic teaching continues to maintain that sexual acts are ordered to procreation and the marital bond, which shapes its stance on both premarital sex and same-sex sexual activity.

In Islam, sexual relations are normally permitted only within marriage; zina (fornication or adultery) is strongly prohibited. The majority of Islamic scholars also do not accept same-sex sexual relationships, though there is diversity in modern interpretation and pastoral practice. Non-religious and progressive religious perspectives stress consent, mutual respect and wellbeing as the primary moral criteria, and in Britain the law recognises same-sex marriage and protects sexual orientation as a characteristic against discrimination.

When answering exam questions, show the contrast: explain the reasons behind restrictive positions (scriptural texts, natural law, concerns about social order and children’s welfare) and the reasons behind more liberal positions (human rights, equality, pastoral care and reinterpretation of texts). Use real-life examples such as the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the UK, debates within the Church of England, and differing practices in mosques and Islamic communities to demonstrate how beliefs interact with contemporary society.

## Sex, marriage and divorce: purposes and problems
Studying the nature and purpose of marriage requires you to explain multiple functions: companionship, sexual intimacy, procreation, the stability and protection of children, and the transmission of faith and values. Christianity traditionally presents marriage as a covenant reflecting God’s faithful love; Catholicism describes marriage as a sacrament, while many Protestant traditions emphasise covenantal vows and mutual support. Islam sees marriage as a legal and moral framework to regulate sexual relations and protect family life, with clear rights and duties for spouses.

Divorce and remarriage reveal tensions between ideals and reality. Some religions take a strict line: the Roman Catholic Church teaches that a valid sacramental marriage is indissoluble, while recognising annulment in certain cases and offering pastoral care for divorced people. Other Christian groups allow divorce and remarriage in particular circumstances, often citing compassion and the need to protect individuals from harmful situations. Islam permits divorce (talaq and other procedures) though it discourages it and encourages reconciliation; remarriage is allowed following appropriate waiting periods. Ethical arguments about divorce include the sanctity of vows versus compassion for suffering, and practical concerns about children’s welfare and social stability.

In your answers, balance teaching with lived experience. Refer to how faith communities provide pastoral support, marriage preparation and counselling, and how legal structures in Britain interact with religious practice (for example, civil marriage, religious marriage ceremonies, and the legal status of divorce).

## Families, gender roles and equality: beliefs and contemporary issues
The role of men and women and the meaning of gender equality is a central part of Theme A. Different religious traditions offer diverse emphases. Some strands of Christianity and other faiths have historically assigned complementary roles to men and women, often drawing on scriptural passages that emphasise male headship in the household. Other Christian traditions and many modern religious thinkers argue for gender equality based on the equal worth of all humans before God. Sikhism explicitly teaches the equality of men and women and rejects caste and gender discrimination; this teaching has been influential in Sikh communities in Britain. Within Islam and Judaism there are both traditional roles and modern reform movements: Orthodox communities tend to maintain distinctive gender roles in religious practice, while Reform and progressive movements promote equal leadership, ritual participation and interpretation.

Contemporary family issues you should be able to discuss include same-sex parents, polygamy and how gender prejudice affects opportunities and treatment. Polygamy, while allowed in certain historical religious contexts (for example regulated polygyny in classical Islamic law), is not permitted under UK law and is rare in British religious communities; it raises legal and ethical questions about equality and consent. Debates about same-sex parenting focus on the welfare of children, the right to form families, and religious teachings about marriage and family.

When revising, link beliefs with how families actually live: consider the roles of extended families, single-parent households and blended families, and how religious communities respond to social changes. Use concrete examples such as faith-based charities that support families, religious marriage preparation classes, and public debates about gender and schooling to illustrate impact.

## Religious teachings in the British context: interaction with law and society
Theme A requires you to be aware of how religious teachings interact with contemporary British society. Britain’s legal framework now recognises same-sex marriage and protects individuals from discrimination on grounds of sexuality and gender. At the same time, freedom of religion is protected, which produces tensions when religious doctrines conflict with equality legislation. Churches, mosques, synagogues and temples make different choices about how to act: some religious bodies refuse to conduct same-sex marriages while offering pastoral care, others change their liturgy and practice to welcome LGBTQ+ people as equal members.

Religious communities also shape public life through schools, charities and campaigning organisations. For example, faith schools teach particular views on relationships and families that may differ from secular curricula, and faith-based charities provide marriage support, family counselling and practical help for parents. In the exam you can strengthen arguments by explaining these real-world interactions: how law, pastoral care and social attitudes influence believers’ choices and how religious groups respond to changing cultural norms.

## Key ethical arguments and the use of sources
To achieve high marks you should be able to set religious teachings alongside ethical reasoning. Natural law and traditional religious moral systems often stress fixed purposes (such as procreation) and objective moral rules. Utilitarian and rights-based approaches focus instead on outcomes and individual autonomy. Virtue ethics emphasises character and the development of moral habits in family life. When you use religious sources, identify their authority clearly: Christian students might refer to teachings about marriage as a covenant; Muslim students might refer to guidance on marriage and family found in the Qur’an and Hadith; Sikh students can draw on the Guru Granth Sahib’s emphasis on truthful living and equality. Always explain how a teaching is applied and what it means for followers in practice.

## Exam technique
When answering Theme A questions, plan to show both AO1 and AO2. For AO1 answers make precise, accurate statements about religious teachings and include sources of authority where appropriate. For AO2 analysis and evaluation, weigh evidence, explain implications and present balanced arguments. Start longer answers with a clear introduction that outlines the issue and the viewpoints you will consider. Use paragraphs that each make a focused point: state a claim, explain it with a teaching or example, and show its significance. For evaluation, compare religious and non-religious perspectives, consider strengths and weaknesses of arguments (for instance, questions of interpretation, pastoral concerns, social consequences), and reach a reasoned conclusion that reflects the debate. Refer to contemporary British examples to demonstrate relevance and use specialist terms (such as “cohabitation”, “sacrament”, “talaq”, “gender prejudice”) accurately. Manage your time so you can develop your 12-mark responses with clear reasoning and supporting evidence, and remember that up to three SPaG marks are available for clear spelling, punctuation and grammar.
