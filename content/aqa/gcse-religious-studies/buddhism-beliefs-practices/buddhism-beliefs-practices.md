# Buddhism: beliefs and practices (GCSE Religious Studies Assessment and Qualifications Alliance)

## Key concepts and the nature of the Dhamma
Buddhism is a non-theistic religion that centres on the Dhamma (or Dharma): the teaching or truth discovered by the Buddha about how things are. Central to the Dhamma are ideas about dependent arising, usually expressed by the Pali term paticcasamuppada, which teaches that all things arise in dependence on conditions and nothing exists independently. This view helps explain change and suffering in the world. Closely linked to dependent arising are the Three Marks of Existence: anicca (impermanence), anatta (no fixed, eternal self) and dukkha (unsatisfactoriness or suffering). These three insights are the lens through which Buddhists understand experience and they underpin ethical, meditative and philosophical responses to life. In Mahayana branches the language of emptiness or sunyata develops these ideas further by emphasising that phenomena lack independent self-nature, and some Mahayana schools teach a universal Buddha‑nature—an inherent potential for awakening in all beings.

## The Buddha and the path to awakening
The historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, is the human who achieved full awakening and whose life story serves as the exemplar for Buddhists. Traditional accounts describe his sheltered princely upbringing, the Four Sights—old age, illness, death and a renunciant—which prompted him to seek an answer to suffering, his period of ascetic practice, and finally his Enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. His discovery of the Four Noble Truths forms the core of Buddhist teaching. The truths begin with the recognition that life involves dukkha, go on to identify craving (tanha) and ignorance as causes, state that there is an end to suffering (nibbana/nirvana), and prescribe a practical path—the Eightfold Path—leading to that end. The Buddha’s teachings are preserved in a range of texts: for Theravada Buddhists the Pali Canon and Dhammapada are central, while Mahayana traditions rely on various sutras and later commentaries.

## The Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path and the Threefold Way
The Four Noble Truths are both diagnostic and prescriptive: they diagnose suffering, explain its condition, promise its cessation, and provide a path. The Eightfold Path is typically grouped into the Threefold Way of ethical conduct (sila), mental discipline or meditation (samadhi) and wisdom (panna). Ethical conduct includes right speech, right action and right livelihood; meditation includes right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration; wisdom includes right view and right intention. These teachings are not merely theoretical: in practice they form a training programme aimed at transforming thought, speech and action so that attachment and ignorance are weakened and insight into reality is developed. Nibbana is the term used to describe the extinguishing of the fires of greed, hatred and delusion; it is described more by what it ends than by positive attributes and is treated with caution in language, as it transcends ordinary description.

## Human nature, rebirth and kamma
Buddhist accounts of the human person differ from many religious views of a permanent soul. In Theravada this is explained by the Five Aggregates (skandhas): form (physical body), sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness, which together constitute the person but are impermanent and without an enduring self. Mahayana alternatives emphasise sunyata and the idea that apparent personal identity is a conventional designation. Rebirth in Buddhism is explained without a soul passing from life to life; instead, a continuing stream of mental and karmic tendencies conditions a new life. Kamma (karma) is the moral law of cause and effect: intentional actions have consequences for future experience. This ethical causality provides a moral framework for decisions and explains why actions matter. Different traditions emphasise different goals: Theravada often holds the ideal of the arahant (or arhat), a perfected person who has attained nibbana, whereas Mahayana promotes the bodhisattva ideal—postponing final liberation to help all sentient beings reach awakening, and in some schools developing the notion of Buddhahood and Pure Lands as accessible spiritual realities.

## Worship, places and the role of the community
Buddhist practice takes place in many settings: in local household shrines, temples, monasteries (viharas), and meditation centres or gompas. A physical image of the Buddha, or Buddha rupa, is common in shrines and temples and functions as a focus for respect, reflection and inspiration rather than object worship in the theistic sense. Devotional practices such as puja often include offerings, chanting and bowing; these practices cultivate gratitude, humility and concentration. The sangha—the community of monks, nuns and lay followers—plays a vital role in preserving the teaching, making merit and providing ethical and spiritual support. In modern Britain many Buddhists combine traditional temple life with secular activities such as meditation groups, community service and social events, contributing to the diversity of contemporary Buddhist presence in the UK.

## Meditation and devotional practices
Meditation is central to Buddhism and appears in many forms with different aims. Samatha practices develop concentration and tranquility, often using mindfulness of breathing as a basic technique. Vipassana practices cultivate insight into the Three Marks of Existence and the nature of experience; these often involve careful observation of bodily sensations, feelings and thoughts to see their impermanent, unsatisfactory and non-self character. Zen traditions emphasise zazen—sitting meditation—as a direct means to awaken, while Pure Land practices emphasise devotional recitation and visualisation aimed at rebirth in an enlightened realm. Mantra recitation, the use of malas (prayer beads), and chanting of sutras or verses from texts like the Dhammapada are used for concentration, devotion and ethical reflection. Visualisation of Buddhas and bodhisattvas has a prominent place in some Mahayana and Vajrayana practices, where imagery supports transformation of the mind.

## Buddhist ethics, precepts and the six perfections
Buddhist ethics is grounded in the understanding that wholesome actions lead to happier, less fettered states of mind and harmful actions produce suffering. The Five Moral Precepts function as basic ethical commitments for many lay Buddhists: to refrain from taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct or misuse of the senses, lying, and taking intoxicants that cloud the mind. These precepts are training rules rather than absolute commandments and are undertaken voluntarily with an understanding of their importance for personal and communal well-being. Compassion (karuna) and loving-kindness (metta) are central virtues; practices such as metta meditation intentionally cultivate these attitudes. In Mahayana traditions the Six Perfections or paramitas—generosity, morality, patience, energy, meditation and wisdom—offer a comprehensive path for bodhisattvas, combining ethical behaviour with active engagement in the world and advanced meditative training.

## Festivals, death rituals and Buddhism in Britain
Festivals and rituals express communal memory and religious identity. Wesak (or Vesak) commemorates the Buddha’s birth, Enlightenment and Parinirvana and is often the most widely observed festival, marked by temple ceremonies, acts of generosity and reflections on the Buddha’s life. Parinirvana Day is a time to remember the Buddha’s passing and to reflect on impermanence. Funeral rites differ widely: Theravada communities often emphasise merit-making for the deceased and straightforward cremation practices, while Tibetan traditions include elaborate rites concerned with the intermediate state and Japanese forms may involve memorial services. In Britain, Buddhist groups contribute to public life through meditation classes in schools and health services, mindfulness-based interventions in the NHS and community projects that promote well-being. These activities show how ancient teachings about mind and ethics continue to influence individuals and communities today.

## Diversity within Buddhism and applying knowledge in context
Buddhism comprises diverse schools and cultural expressions. Theravada, prevalent in Southeast Asia, is often considered conservative in its textual reliance on the Pali Canon and its emphasis on the arahant ideal. Mahayana, found across East Asia, introduces new sutras and concepts such as the bodhisattva path, buddha-nature and a variety of devotional, philosophical and ritual forms. Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism incorporates tantric practices and unique ritual systems. Zen emphasises direct, non-conceptual insight while Pure Land emphasises faith and devotion. When answering exam questions, it is valuable to show awareness of these differences: for example, explain how Theravada and Mahayana approaches to the self, liberation and ethical ideals might lead to different attitudes towards lay practice, monastic authority or devotional behaviours. Applying teachings to contemporary scenarios—such as ethical decision-making, environmental concerns or mental health—demonstrates understanding of how beliefs shape action.

## Exam technique
When answering GCSE questions on Buddhism, be clear about which assessment objective you are addressing. AO1 requires accurate knowledge and understanding: define key terms such as anatta, dependent arising, nibbana and kamma, and explain core teachings like the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path with reference to appropriate sources or examples. AO2 requires analysis and evaluation: compare different Buddhist responses, weigh strengths and weaknesses of an argument, and consider the influence of belief on individuals and society. In shorter questions give precise factual answers and use specialist vocabulary correctly. For 4- and 6-mark questions expand by explaining significance and giving short examples, such as how metta meditation might alter a person’s response to conflict. For 12-mark questions plan a developed answer: start with clear knowledge, then analyse opposing views or consequences, and finish with a reasoned conclusion that answers the question directly. Use examples from different traditions (Theravada versus Mahayana, or practices in Britain) to show range, and where relevant refer to scripture, stories or teachings (for example, the Jataka tales or verses from the Dhammapada) to support points. Manage time so you can leave a few minutes to proofread extended answers, and remember that up to three SPaG marks are available for clear spelling, punctuation and grammar. Writing coherently and demonstrating an ability to balance knowledge with evaluation will secure higher marks.
