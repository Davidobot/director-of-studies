# Liberalism and Nationalism in Italy and Germany, 1815–1871 (A-level History Cambridge International)

## Key ideas: liberalism and nationalism in context
Between 1815 and 1871 two powerful ideologies shaped the politics of central Europe: liberalism, which emphasised constitutional government, individual rights and often free‑market economics; and nationalism, which argued that people who shared language, culture and history should form their own sovereign state. These ideas sometimes reinforced each other — many liberals were also nationalists — but they could also conflict. Liberal nationalists wanted representative institutions for a united nation; other nationalists sought unity even if it meant authoritarian or conservative rule. Understanding the interplay between these doctrines helps explain why Italy and Germany moved from fragmentation and foreign domination to national consolidation by 1871, yet by very different routes.

## Italy after 1815: fragmentation, secret societies and competing visions
The Congress of Vienna (1815) restored pre‑Napoleonic rulers across the Italian peninsula and reinforced the division of Italy into multiple states: the Kingdom of Sardinia–Piedmont in the northwest, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the south, the Papal States centered on Rome, the Grand Duchies in central Italy, and Austrian domination in Lombardy–Venetia. Under this settlement Italian nationalists faced regionalism, local loyalties and the strength of conservative regimes backed by Austria. In response, a variety of movements emerged. Carbonari and other secret societies promoted constitutionalism and revolutionary action, while intellectuals and exiles developed ideological programmes: Giuseppe Mazzini’s Young Italy combined republicanism and popular national self‑determination; moderate liberals in Piedmont sought constitutional reform and international alliances. The social base for change was uneven: the middle classes provided much of the organisational energy for liberalism, peasants were often conservative or indifferent, and the urban poor could be mobilised by charismatic leaders.

## The Revolutions of 1848 and their aftermath in Italy
The wave of 1848 challenged restoration regimes across Europe and exposed the gaps between liberal and nationalist aspirations. In Italy, uprisings forced the granting of constitutions in several states, and the Roman Republic of 1849 under Mazzini briefly embodied the republican nationalist ideal. Piedmont under Charles Albert fought Austria in 1848–49 but was defeated; the Frankfurt Parliament’s Italian equivalent failed to translate popular momentum into sustainable institutions. After 1849 the old order reasserted itself: Austria regained control of Lombardy–Venetia and the Papacy reoccupied Rome. Yet 1848 was decisive in other ways: it discredited the idea that spontaneous revolution alone could unify Italy, revealed the weakness of popular nationalist projects led by idealists like Mazzini, and pushed more pragmatic actors — above all in Piedmont — toward a strategy of diplomatic manoeuvre and limited warfare.

## The Risorgimento: Cavour, Garibaldi and the stages of unification
Unification ultimately came through a mixture of diplomacy, limited war and popular action. Count Camillo di Cavour, Piedmont’s prime minister from the 1850s, combined liberal domestic reform with a realist foreign policy. He modernised Piedmont’s economy, supported railways and the press, and sought allies against Austria. His secret negotiation with Napoleon III at Plombières (1858) produced French military support against Austria in return for territorial concessions. The 1859 Second Italian War of Independence, fought by Piedmont with French help, expelled Austria from Lombardy, while nationalist uprisings and plebiscites in central Italy led to annexation by Piedmont. Meanwhile Giuseppe Garibaldi, a veteran of republican uprisings and a popular military leader, landed in Sicily in 1860 with his “Expedition of the Thousand” and conquered the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, handing it over to Victor Emmanuel II. By 1861 the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel as king, but important pieces remained: Venetia was still Austrian and Rome remained under Papal control protected by French troops. Venetia was acquired after the Austro‑Prussian War of 1866 when Italy sided with Prussia, and Rome joined Italy in 1870 when French troops withdrew during the Franco‑Prussian War and Italian forces entered the city. The Risorgimento therefore combined liberal reform, diplomatic bargaining, foreign intervention and popular military action in stages rather than by a single blueprint.

## Germany after 1815: disunity, economic integration and intellectual nationalism
The German lands remained divided into a patchwork of some thirty‑nine states dominated by Austria and Prussia. The post‑Napoleonic settlement sought to conserve dynastic rule under the German Confederation, but intellectual and cultural movements nurtured a sense of German identity. Student associations, professors and writers promoted a cultural nationalism that idealised language and history; liberals in towns and the growing middle classes demanded constitutions and national unity. Economically, the Zollverein (a customs union led by Prussia from 1834) knitted many German states together and strengthened Prussia’s position, showing that economic integration could precede political unification. Politically, however, the key questions were whether unification would be “Greater Germany” including Austria, or “Lesser Germany” excluding Austria and led by Prussia, and whether the result would be liberal and constitutional or conservative and monarchical.

## 1848 in Germany and Bismarck’s road to unification, 1862–1871
The 1848 revolutions produced the Frankfurt Parliament, which attempted to draft a constitution for a united Germany and offered the crown to the Prussian king; Frederick William IV refused it, unwilling to accept a crown “from the gutter,” and the liberal project faltered. The failure of 1848 made clear that liberal nationalism lacked the force to overcome dynastic power without broader social and institutional support. Into this vacuum stepped Otto von Bismarck, appointed Prussian minister‑president in 1862. Bismarck was a conservative Prussian aristocrat who believed in realpolitik: power politics, careful diplomacy and the calculated use of military force. His famous “blood and iron” orientation meant that he aimed to achieve unification by strengthening the state and using wars to remove rivals. Between 1864 and 1871 he engineered three conflicts to achieve this: the joint Austro‑Prussian victory over Denmark (1864) over Schleswig and Holstein, the Austro‑Prussian War (1866) which decisively sidelined Austria and created a North German Confederation under Prussian leadership, and the Franco‑Prussian War (1870–71), where Prussian victories over Napoleon III rallied the southern German states to unite with the North in the face of a common enemy. The German Empire was proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles in January 1871 with King Wilhelm I as Kaiser, completing unification on conservative, Prussian terms rather than liberal parliamentary models.

## Comparing paths and tensions: ideology, methods and outcomes
Italy and Germany both moved from fragmentation to unified states within a generation, yet their trajectories reveal contrasts. Italian unification was driven by a Piedmontese-led constitutional monarchy that combined diplomatic alliances, limited wars and popular insurrections. The Italian process preserved liberal parliamentary institutions in Piedmont and sought to reconcile monarchy with nationalism, though the south and Rome posed challenges for national integration. German unification was achieved under Prussian authoritarian leadership, where liberal constitutionalism was subordinated to state power and military efficiency. Bismarck co‑opted conservative elites and neutralised liberal opposition; the resulting German Empire had a constitution and parliament, but power remained heavily weighted toward the Kaiser, the chancellor and the Prussian military. In both cases foreign powers mattered decisively: Austrian domination shaped both struggles, France alternately supported and then opposed Italian and German ambitions, and Britain’s general reluctance to intervene allowed continental actors room to manoeuvre. The outcomes illustrate the tension between liberal aspirations for representative national states and nationalist outcomes achieved by conservative elites: national unity was realised, but not always in the liberal, democratic form many activists had hoped for in the 1820s and 1830s.

## Key individuals and their contrasting approaches
Understanding personalities clarifies why events unfolded as they did. Mazzini represented the idealistic republican strand of nationalism, seeking mass mobilisation and democratic institutions; his influence was moral and intellectual more than practical after 1848. Garibaldi was a popular military nationalist whose volunteers achieved spectacular conquests but who deferred to the monarchical state for national consolidation. Cavour exemplified pragmatic liberalism: he pursued economic modernisation, constitutional government in Piedmont and a foreign policy that used great‑power alliances to achieve national aims. In Germany, figures such as Frederick William IV rejected offers of a national crown that would compromise royal prerogatives, while Bismarck put conservative statecraft first, deliberately manipulating wars and nationalist sentiment to build a unified empire that preserved elite control. These contrasting personalities show how individuals combined ideology, opportunity and state resources to shape national outcomes.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on liberalism and nationalism in Italy and Germany, begin by defining your key terms — what you mean by liberalism and by nationalism — and set the chronological and geographical parameters of your answer. For source‑based questions, use provenance and content: consider who produced the source, when and why, and then weigh it against your own knowledge of events such as the Revolutions of 1848, the Zollverein, Plombières, the Wars of 1859, 1866 and 1870–71, Garibaldi’s expedition, and Bismarck’s policies. Structure essays so that each paragraph makes a clear point supported by specific evidence, and where appropriate weigh contrasting interpretations: for example, compare Mazzinian republicanism with Cavourian pragmatism, or the liberal hopes of 1848 with the conservative reality of Bismarckian unification. In “how far” or “to what extent” questions, explicitly assess both sides and reach a balanced judgement that recognises complexity — that liberal and nationalist ideas motivated many actors, but that practical politics, foreign intervention and the choices of elites often determined the final form of unification. Finally, use precise dates and place names to anchor your argument and, where relevant, address consequences (political structures, regional integration problems, and the fate of liberalism after unification) to demonstrate breadth and depth of knowledge.
