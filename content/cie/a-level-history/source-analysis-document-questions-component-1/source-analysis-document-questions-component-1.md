# Source analysis: document questions (Component 1) (A-level History Cambridge International)

## What Component 1 tests and why it matters
Component 1 asks you to work with contemporary documents and short extracts to answer two linked questions about a focused issue in a prescribed topic. This component is designed to assess your ability to read, compare and evaluate sources as historical evidence and to bring your own factual knowledge to bear in judging how far the sources support a given assertion. At AS level Component 1 is a 1 hour paper worth a large share of the AS mark, while at A Level the same paper remains one hour but contributes a smaller percentage of the full A Level. Either way, examiners are looking for two connected skills: accurate and relevant factual knowledge, and the ability to interrogate sources — to identify what they say, why they say it, how reliable they are, and how useful they are for answering the question posed.

## Question structure and timing
Each question on Component 1 has two parts. Part (a) requires a focused comparison of two sources on a specific aspect of the topic; it tests close reading and comparison skills. Part (b) asks you to use all the sources provided and your own knowledge to judge how far the sources support a particular statement. Typical papers present at least three sources, none exceeding a total of 600 words, and the whole question must be completed in one hour. Time management is therefore essential: allocate time so that part (a) is precise and concise, leaving the bulk of your time for the evaluative and synthetic work required in part (b).

## Reading and analysing sources: content, provenance and context
When you first read the sources, your task is to understand what each one is explicitly saying and what it implies. Read for the message, the tone, and any silences or absences of information that might be significant. Next, consider provenance: who produced the source, when, where and for what audience or purpose. Provenance matters because it helps you judge reliability and bias. A government proclamation intended to reassure voters will be selective; a private letter written immediately after an event may be candid but parochial; a newspaper editorial reflects a political stance and an intended readership. Contextualise each source historically: place it in the sequence of events, connect it to what you know about institutions, personalities and wider developments, and use that knowledge to test the source’s claims. Finally, judge the source’s utility for the specific question you have been set. A source may be accurate in what it reports but limited in scope, or it may be polemical and hence useful for understanding attitudes rather than objective facts.

## Part (a): comparing two sources effectively
Part (a) demands a direct comparison. Begin with a short statement that answers the question: identify clearly whether the two sources agree, disagree, or partially agree on the aspect named. Then set out the basis for that judgement by referring to precise points in each source. Use the language of comparison — similarity, difference, emphasis — but avoid mere paraphrase or listing. For example, if two sources on the unification of Italy address the role of Cavour, you might note that one source stresses diplomatic skill and foreign alliances while the other highlights domestic reform and Piedmontese initiative; show the textual evidence in each that leads you to this conclusion, and explain briefly why those differences matter for interpreting the episode. Where appropriate, bring in provenance to explain differences: a memoir written by a participant tends to justify personal decisions; a foreign diplomat’s report will emphasise international factors. Keep this part tightly focused: examiners expect a sharp, analytical comparison rather than an extended essay.

## Part (b): synthesising sources and own knowledge to reach a judgement
Part (b) is the heart of the paper. You must take a given statement and evaluate how far the set of sources supports it, using both the documents and your own factual knowledge. Start by restating the statement in your own words and outlining the parameters of your response. Then, systematically evaluate the evidence. Group your analysis thematically rather than treating each source in isolation: use the sources to build a case for and against the statement, and interweave your own knowledge to corroborate, qualify or contradict what the sources claim. For example, on a statement about the League of Nations’ ability to preserve peace, you might use sources that show successful technical work on health or labour to argue that the League had strengths, then use other sources and your knowledge of Manchuria and Abyssinia to demonstrate the League’s political failures. Weigh evidence and explain relative significance: a source showing effective humanitarian work is important, but it may be less decisive when the question concerns major political conflicts. End with a succinct judgement that answers the question as framed, indicating the degree to which the sources collectively support the statement and why.

## Topic-specific guidance: what examiners tend to include and how to use background knowledge
Component 1 offers three topic options: Liberalism and Nationalism in Italy and Germany (1815–1871), The Origins of the Civil War in the USA (1846–1861), and The Search for International Peace and Security (1919–1945). Each lends itself to particular kinds of sources and lines of questioning.

In the Italian and German unification option, expect sources such as speeches, diplomatic dispatches, newspaper reports and memoirs. These will often debate the relative importance of ideas, social pressures and great-power diplomacy. Useful background knowledge includes the upheavals of 1848–49, the domestic strengths and limitations of Piedmont and Prussia, the policies and personalities of Cavour, Garibaldi and Bismarck, and the sequence of wars and diplomatic manoeuvres that produced unification. When assessing sources, pay attention to regional bias (North vs South, Prussia vs smaller German states), and remember that participants often justify decisions in hindsight.

In the American Civil War option, typical sources are congressional debates, newspaper accounts, political speeches, private correspondence and legal documents. The paper often focuses on sectional tensions produced by territorial expansion, legislative compromises and judicial rulings. Bring in knowledge of the Mexican War settlement, the Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act, the Kansas-Nebraska crisis, Dred Scott, the Republican Party’s rise and the 1860 election. When interpreting provenance, distinguish between Northern and Southern perspectives, and between politicians defending policy and activists campaigning for or against slavery.

In the International Peace and Security option, anticipate sources such as covenant texts, speeches by statesmen, League and UN reports, and contemporary commentary. Familiarity with the aims and structure of the League, its specialised agencies, notable successes in humanitarian areas, and major failures over Manchuria and Abyssinia is essential. For the UN, know the foundations laid at San Francisco and key differences from the League. Evaluate sources by considering national interest, the diplomatic context and the changing global power balance across the interwar and wartime periods.

Across all topics, recognise that sources come in different genres and from different perspectives: statistical tables and treaties are factual but limited in interpretation; speeches and reports reveal aims and rhetoric; private letters may reveal candid motives but are narrow. Your task is to combine these different kinds of evidence with secure factual knowledge to address the specific proposition given in the question.

## Common pitfalls and examiner expectations
Examiners expect clear, well-structured answers that balance source analysis with factual knowledge. A frequent error is to treat provenance superficially or mechanically; provenance should be used to explain why a source presents a particular view and how that affects its reliability and usefulness for the question. Another common weakness is over-reliance on paraphrase of sources without critical evaluation; you must move beyond what the source says to explain why it might say it, what it leaves out, and how it fits with other evidence. Avoid long narrative digressions that do not directly illuminate the question. Examiners also look for precision in using your own knowledge: specific dates, events and names that directly corroborate or refute the sources strengthen your argument. Finally, explicit weighing of evidence — saying which factors are most convincing and why — lifts an answer from competent to excellent.

## Using provenance and content together
Provenance and content are not alternatives but two sides of the same analytical task. When you describe what a source says, immediately ask why the author might say it and how the author’s position shapes the content. For instance, a speech by Bismarck explaining a military action should be read both for the factual claims it makes and for the political purpose it serves. Does it seek to justify aggression, to rally domestic support, or to reassure foreign powers? Does the timing of the source — before, during or after a crisis — affect its candidness? Similarly, when a newspaper editorial supports a compromise like that of 1850, consider the paper’s readership and political alignment before treating the editorial as a straightforward report of opinion. Use provenance judiciously: well-chosen provenance can account for differences between sources and is most persuasive when linked to specific content.

## Exam technique
Approach the paper with a clear plan and strict timing. Spend the first five minutes reading all the sources carefully and noting key points and provenance. For part (a) spend about twelve to fifteen minutes writing a concise comparative answer that states the relationship between the two sources, supports that claim with precise references to each source, and where relevant uses provenance to explain differences. Reserve the remaining time for part (b), planning a clear essay-style response. Begin part (b) with a short thesis and a roadmap of the factors you will consider. Structure the main body thematically, using the sources as evidence for and against the proposition and integrating your own knowledge to test the sources. Use provenance when it explains why a source supports or contradicts the statement, but avoid letting provenance dominate: the substance of the sources and the factual background matter most. Make explicit evaluations of each source’s usefulness, noting strengths, limitations and silences, and conclude with a balanced judgement that answers the question directly. Keep sentences focused, use precise historical terms and names, and ensure every paragraph advances your argument. Practise this method under timed conditions with past sources from each topic so that in the exam your reading, planning and writing are confident, efficient and firmly targeted at what the examiners are asking you to demonstrate.
