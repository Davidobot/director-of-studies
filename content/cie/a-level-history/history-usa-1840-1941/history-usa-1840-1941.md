# History of the USA, 1840–1941 (A-level History Cambridge International)

## Overview: themes and chronology
This period in American history traces the transformation of a continental republic into a major industrial and international power, while also confronting deep internal divisions over slavery, race, class and the role of the federal state. From the expansionist energy of the 1840s and the violent rupture of the Civil War to the rapid industrialisation of the Gilded Age, the reforming energies of the Progressive Era and the shock of the Great Depression, students should follow not only events but underlying themes: expansion and imperialism; the causes and consequences of sectional conflict; economic modernisation and its social effects; the contested nature of democracy and citizenship; and shifts in the United States’ global role. Chronology matters, but so does causation: many developments—technological, political and social—interacted to produce the outcomes you will be asked to explain.

## Expansion and the growth of American power, 1840–1900
Expansion across the continent and beyond is central to the story of mid-19th to early 20th century America. The idea of Manifest Destiny gave popular expression to a conviction that the United States was destined to extend westward, a belief realised through treaties, purchases and war. The Mexican–American War (1846–48) and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo added vast territories to the Union, producing immediate political problems about the extension of slavery. The purchase of Alaska in 1867 and the later annexation of Hawaii reflected continuing territorial ambitions. By the 1890s a new assertiveness in foreign policy saw the United States fight the Spanish–American War (1898), seize colonies such as the Philippines and Puerto Rico, and assert a greater naval presence. The Open Door policy in China and the construction of the Panama Canal signalled US interest in global commerce and strategic influence. Interpreting this expansion involves weighing ideological motives, economic interests, strategic concerns and cultural attitudes; for example, debates continue about whether the late 19th-century overseas ventures were driven more by commercial opportunity, missionary impulses, racial attitudes, or a desire for great-power status.

## The road to civil war, 1846–1861
The collapse towards war in 1861 is best seen as the product of a sequence of political crises in which the national question of slavery repeatedly erupted. The Mexican War intensified sectional tensions by creating new territories whose status raised the question of free or slave institutions. Compromises—the Missouri Compromise earlier, and the Compromise of 1850—temporarily held the Union together, but measures like the Fugitive Slave Act inflamed northern opinion. The Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854), which introduced popular sovereignty to decide slavery’s fate, produced violent conflict in Kansas and shattered older party alignments, contributing to the formation of the Republican Party as an anti-slavery-extension force. Judicial decisions, especially the Dred Scott ruling (1857), heightened polarisation by denying Congress the power to exclude slavery from the territories. Radical actions, including John Brown’s raid at Harpers Ferry (1859), and the sectional split in the 1860 presidential election produced a constitutional crisis. Lincoln’s election, with no electoral support from the Deep South, precipitated secession and the establishment of a Confederate government. Assessing the causes of secession requires attention to political ideology, economic structures, and cultural self-definition in the slave South.

## Civil War and Reconstruction, 1861–1877
The Civil War tested the resilience of the American republic. Military outcome was shaped by resources and strategy: the North’s industrial capacity, transport networks and manpower advantages contrasted with the Confederacy’s defensive posture, military leadership and local motivations. The war brought extraordinary constitutional change in the name of preserving the Union and eventually abolishing slavery. Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation (1863) reframed the conflict and opened the way for African Americans to fight for the Union. After 1865, Reconstruction was a contentious experiment in remaking southern society and integrating freedpeople. Presidential and Radical Republican approaches clashed over the pace and scope of reform. Constitutional amendments—the 13th (abolishing slavery), the 14th (citizenship and equal protection) and the 15th (voting rights for black men)—created a new legal framework, but implementation faltered. The rise of Black Codes, white supremacist violence, and waning northern commitment culminated in the Compromise of 1877, which effectively ended federal enforcement of Reconstruction and ushered in decades of segregation and disenfranchisement. A-level essays should weigh the achievements of Reconstruction—legal rights and temporary political gains—against its limits and eventual rollback.

## Industrialisation and the Gilded Age, 1870s–1900
Between the 1870s and the turn of the century the United States underwent dramatic economic transformation. Rapid industrialisation, driven by railroads, steel, oil and new technologies, produced unprecedented wealth and concentrated economic power in trusts and large corporations such as Carnegie Steel and Standard Oil. The growth of finance, the expansion of markets and protective tariffs fostered capitalist development, while mass immigration from southern and eastern Europe supplied labour for factories and cities. Urban growth created opportunities and profound social problems: overcrowded housing, unsanitary conditions and political machines which traded services for votes. The Gilded Age was an era of dramatic inequality and frequent labour conflict, visible in events like the Haymarket affair, the Homestead Strike and the Pullman Strike. Farmers, hit by falling prices and indebtedness, mobilised through the Populist movement, demanding monetary reform and political change. Understanding the Gilded Age means tracing how economic modernity produced both prosperity and social dislocation, provoking popular protest and eventually inspiring reform.

## The Progressive Era, 1890s–1920s
Progressivism emerged as a response to the excesses of the Gilded Age, seeking to use government power to regulate business, curb corruption, and improve social conditions. Progressives were a diverse coalition that included middle-class reformers, journalists (the “muckrakers”), labour activists and some corporate leaders. Reforms included antitrust actions, regulation of food and drugs, improvements in municipal government, and measures aimed at political democracy such as the direct election of senators (the 17th Amendment) and expanded use of primaries. Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency exemplified activist governance with his “trust-busting” and conservation policies; Woodrow Wilson’s administration introduced the Federal Reserve and progressive legislation such as the Clayton Antitrust Act. Social reforms also advanced the cause of women’s suffrage, culminating in the 19th Amendment in 1920. Yet the Progressive Era was not uniformly inclusive: racial segregation and discrimination persisted, and many reforms applied unevenly across regions and classes. Teaching this period requires balancing the era’s achievements in efficiency and social welfare with its blind spots and limits.

## The USA in the world and the inter-war years, 1914–1939
World War I marked a turning point in America’s international role. Initially neutral, the United States entered the war in 1917 driven by unrestricted submarine warfare, economic ties to the Allies and the Zimmermann Telegram. President Wilson’s Fourteen Points and his advocacy for the League of Nations represented a new aspiration for international leadership based on collective security and self-determination, but the Senate’s refusal to ratify the Treaty of Versailles signalled a return to isolationist instincts. The 1920s saw relative disengagement from European politics combined with economic dynamism at home, the extension of consumer culture, and restrictive immigration policies reflecting nativist anxieties. In the 1930s the trauma of the Great Depression and memories of the slaughter in Europe reinforced neutrality; Congressional Neutrality Acts and a reluctance to become entangled in foreign wars dominated policy until the end of the period covered here. Nevertheless, the United States continued to project power in the Western Hemisphere through policies such as the Roosevelt Corollary and interventions in Latin America, reflecting a blend of isolationism and regional dominance.

## The Great Depression and the New Deal, 1929–1941
The Wall Street Crash of 1929 ushered in the Great Depression, a profound economic collapse marked by mass unemployment, bank failures and collapse of international trade. Explanations of the Crash and Depression combine structural weaknesses—overproduction in agriculture and industry, unequal income distribution, speculative finance and international debt—and policy responses that initially failed to stabilise the economy. Herbert Hoover’s measures were limited and often portrayed as inadequate, while Franklin D. Roosevelt’s election in 1932 brought a dramatic shift. The New Deal, launched in the “Hundred Days,” combined immediate relief, financial reform and long-term recovery through a range of agencies and programmes: public works projects to provide employment, banking reforms to restore confidence, and regulatory agencies to stabilise industry and agriculture. The Second New Deal expanded the social safety net with measures like Social Security and stronger labour protections. Debate continues over the New Deal’s economic effectiveness and constitutional implications: it provided relief and reshaped the relationship between federal government and citizens, but full economic recovery awaited the mobilising effect of wartime production. Politically, the New Deal realigned American politics by creating a broad Democratic coalition that included urban workers, ethnic minorities and African Americans, although systemic racial inequalities frequently limited the benefits they received.

## Exam technique
When answering AS or A-level questions on this topic, begin by reading the question carefully to identify command words such as “explain,” “assess,” “how far,” or “to what extent,” and the precise focus in time and theme. For source or document questions, treat sources as evidence to be tested against contextual knowledge: explain what each source says, evaluate provenance and perspective, and then use your own knowledge to corroborate or challenge the sources’ claims. In essay questions, structure your response with a clear introduction that defines terms and offers a judgement, followed by organised paragraphs that weigh evidence and alternative explanations, and a conclusion that synthesises your analysis. Balance narrative with explanation: chronology is important, but do not let it substitute for causal analysis or evaluation.

You will be assessed on two main skills: demonstrating accurate knowledge and understanding (AO1) and analysing and evaluating evidence and interpretations (AO2). To show AO1, include specific facts, dates, legislation and key figures—examples such as the Kansas–Nebraska Act, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Social Security Act, or events like the Spanish–American War strengthen your answers. To show AO2, consider different interpretations and explain why historians have reached different conclusions: for instance, when assessing the New Deal judge both its immediate relief and its long-term impact, and note critiques from the left and right. Use historiographical phrases sparingly and always link them to evidence.

Plan your time sensibly: spend a few minutes outlining and reserving time to proofread. Avoid over-generalisation; when you make a claim, support it with an example and explain its relevance. In longer essays, use paragraphs to compare factors and to weigh their relative importance, and remember to return to the question in your conclusion rather than simply summarising. Finally, practice writing concise but well-evidenced answers under timed conditions: familiarity with key facts and clear analytical structures is the best preparation for exam success.
