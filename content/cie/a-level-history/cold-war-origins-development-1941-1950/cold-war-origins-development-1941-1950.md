# Origins and Development of the Cold War, 1941–1950 (A-level History Cambridge International)

## Wartime cooperation and the seeds of distrust, 1941–1945
The Cold War did not begin in a vacuum; it evolved out of an uneasy wartime alliance between states whose goals and values often clashed. Between 1941 and 1945 Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union were bound together by the immediate necessity of defeating Nazi Germany, and their leaders—Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin—met at a series of conferences to coordinate strategy. Yet even as they cooperated in military operations, fundamental differences were visible. The Soviets bore the brunt of fighting on the Eastern Front and were determined to secure friendly or controlled borders to prevent future invasion. Western leaders, while sympathetic to Soviet security concerns, continued to promote free elections and markets in liberated states. At Tehran (1943) and Yalta (February 1945) the Allies reached compromises over spheres of influence and the shape of postwar Europe, but the language used—"spheres", "provisional governments", "free and unfettered elections"—left room for conflicting interpretations. The death of Roosevelt in April 1945 removed a moderating personality and increased the potential for friction as postwar settlements were implemented.

## Consolidation in Eastern Europe and early Western responses, 1945–1947
Once the fighting ended, Soviet policy moved quickly to create security buffers by establishing communist-dominated regimes across much of Eastern Europe. In countries such as Poland, Romania and Bulgaria the Red Army’s presence, plus local communist organisation and Soviet political pressure, meant that governments friendly to Moscow emerged rapidly. The contested situation in Poland—between the Lublin government backed by the USSR and the London-based Polish government-in-exile—became an early symbol of broken expectations about self-determination. In the West these developments appeared as Soviet expansionism; in Moscow they were framed as defensive measures to prevent another German threat. British and American reactions hardened as democratic politics in Eastern Europe were steadily curtailed. Greece, where civil conflict resumed in 1946, offered a flashpoint: British assistance to the Greek government ran out in 1947 and the United States moved to fill the gap, announcing the Truman Doctrine that committed the US to supporting states resisting communist pressure. This marked a shift from wartime alliance management to ideological confrontation and political containment.

## Ideology, economics and the new architecture of containment, 1947–1948
By 1947 policy in the West coalesced around the idea of containment: preventing further Soviet political and territorial expansion. George Kennan’s Long Telegram (1946) and his subsequent "X" article argued that Soviet behaviour flowed from a mixture of ideological conviction and security paranoia, and that containment offered a long-term strategy. The Truman Doctrine and, soon after, the Marshall Plan (formulated in 1947 and enacted in 1948) combined political, military and economic tools. The Marshall Plan’s aim to revive European economies was presented as both humanitarian and stabilising; critics argued it also served American economic and political interests by binding Western Europe to the United States and excluding the USSR from a shared recovery. From the Soviet perspective Marshall aid looked like an attempt to undermine communist influence and impose economic dependence, contributing further to mutual suspicion. At the same time debates about the control of nuclear weapons added a dramatic new dimension. The United States’ atomic monopoly in 1945–49, the failure of early multilateral efforts such as the Baruch Plan, and the secrecy that surrounded weapons policy intensified the security dilemma that fed Cold War dynamics.

## Crisis and consolidation, 1948–1949
The late 1940s saw spectacular crises that turned political division into institutional division. British and American currency reforms in West Germany and the introduction of the Deutsche Mark in June 1948 prompted the Soviet Union to impose the Berlin Blockade, a move intended to force the Western powers out of Berlin. In response the Western Allies organised the Berlin Airlift (June 1948–May 1949), an enormous logistical effort that supplied the city by air when ground routes were closed. The success of the airlift was a powerful symbol of Western resolve; the blockade’s end and the formal establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949 signalled that Europe was being divided into rival blocs. In the same period the Czechoslovak coup of February 1948 confirmed to many in the West that democracy in Eastern Europe was being extinguished, and Moscow’s creation of the Cominform in 1947 reinforced the sense of an organised Soviet-led bloc. The formation of NATO in April 1949 institutionalised collective defence in the West and answered Soviet security moves with military alliance-building. The Soviet union’s first successful atomic test in August 1949 ended the American nuclear monopoly, accelerating the arms dimension of the confrontation.

## Leadership, misperception and diplomacy
Individuals mattered in shaping the early Cold War. Stalin’s wartime experience and his commitment to secure buffers shaped an assertive Soviet foreign policy; Churchill’s early warning about an "Iron Curtain" reflected British anxiety about the fate of Eastern Europe. Roosevelt had sought a liberal postwar order framed by multinational institutions; Truman, lacking Roosevelt’s stature and inclined to a firmer anti-communist policy, presided over the adoption of containment. Personality intersected with structural factors: mutual suspicion, differing war aims, and the breakdown of wartime secrecy produced misperceptions. Diplomatic incidents, competing interpretations of agreements at Yalta and Potsdam (July–August 1945), and the slow demobilisation of wartime diplomacy all helped convert rivalry into a durable geopolitical contest. Historians caution against monocausal explanations: decisions emerged out of interactions between leaders’ choices, institutional imperatives and changing international circumstances.

## Interpretations: who was to blame?
The question "Who was to blame for the Cold War?" has inspired sustained historiographical debate. The traditional school, dominant in the early Cold War years, placed primary responsibility on Soviet expansionism and totalitarian aims. For traditionalists, the USSR’s unwillingness to permit free elections and its creation of satellite regimes were decisive. Revisionists, emerging in the 1960s and 1970s, shifted attention to US policy, arguing that American economic and strategic ambitions, and a perceived need to maintain markets and influence, provoked Soviet defensive responses; from this view, containment itself could be seen as aggressive. Post-revisionist accounts sought synthesis: they emphasised a security dilemma in which both sides acted defensively but contributed to escalation through misperception and reciprocal moves. The opening of Soviet archives after 1991 and recent scholarship—sometimes called the "new Cold War history"—has added nuance by showing Stalin’s active role in shaping Eastern Europe while also demonstrating the complexity of Soviet decision-making and the limits of Moscow’s control. Russian historians, predictably, stress Western encirclement and the legacy of past invasions. In practice, exam essays earn top marks when they use these interpretative frameworks to weigh evidence, show causation rather than blame, and reach a balanced judgement that recognises layered causes.

## From political division to global conflict: 1949–1950 and the wider world
By 1949 the Cold War had moved from Europe into a global struggle for influence. The creation of NATO and the Soviet atomic test produced military and psychological shifts. In Asia, the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with a Communist victory, an event that altered American calculations about communism’s global strength. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 transformed the Cold War into a shooting war on the periphery and validated, for many in Washington, arguments that containment required military force as well as economic aid. NSC-68, produced in 1950, advocated a large expansion of US military and political commitments to resist Soviet influence. These developments show how the first postwar decade had moved from diplomatic disagreement and political consolidation to entrenched rivalry with military and ideological dimensions, setting patterns that would persist through the next four decades.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on the origins and development of the Cold War, always begin by defining key terms and setting chronological boundaries: specify what you mean by "Cold War", and whether your focus is 1941–1945, 1945–1948, or 1948–1950. Use a clear paragraph structure: introduce your argument, treat each major factor in its own paragraph with specific evidence (dates, conferences, policies, leaders), and explicitly link evidence to causation. In "how far" or "to what extent" essays, weigh competing factors rather than merely listing them; for example, contrast Soviet security needs with American economic and ideological motives, and assess which had greater causal weight for particular events. Where the question invites historiography (especially for Component 3), identify the historian’s argument, place it within the traditional/revisionist/post-revisionist/new history spectrum, evaluate the evidence and method used, and show how that interpretation compares with others. Use precise examples—Yalta and Potsdam agreements, the Truman Doctrine (1947), the Marshall Plan (1948), the Berlin Blockade/Airlift (1948–49), the Czechoslovak coup (1948), NATO (1949), the Soviet atomic test (1949), the Chinese Communist victory (1949), NSC-68 and Korea (1950)—to anchor your analysis. Avoid overstating certainty: where archives reveal complexity, note ambiguities and limits of sources. Finally, conclude by returning to your thesis and offering a balanced judgement that recognises multiple causes and the interplay of ideology, security and individual decision-making. Use time wisely in the exam: spend the first few minutes planning, and the last few ensuring your argument reads coherently, with dates and historians’ names used to support, not replace, analysis.
