# Causes and Impact of British Imperialism, c.1850–1939 (A-level History Cambridge International)

## Defining the Empire: extent, forms and the “New Imperialism”
By c.1850 Britain already possessed the world’s largest overseas possessions, ranging from settler colonies with self-government to directly ruled territories and economic spheres of influence. Across the period to 1939 the character of that Empire was complex: formal colonies such as large parts of Africa and India were governed directly or through crown administration; protectorates and treaty ports allowed control without full annexation; and informal empire operated where commercial, financial and diplomatic power secured British influence without formal sovereignty. Historians often separate an earlier phase of imperial expansion from a later “New Imperialism” after c.1870, when the scramble for Africa, the intensification of colonial rivalry, and formal annexations accelerated. Understanding British imperialism therefore requires attention both to its geographical reach and to the many administrative and economic forms through which control was exercised.

## Motives and causes of expansion: a multi‑factor explanation
Explaining why Britain expanded between c.1850 and 1939 means weighing economic, strategic, political and ideological motives. Economic arguments remain powerful: investors, manufacturers and merchants sought markets, raw materials and profitable opportunities for overseas capital. Railways, mines and plantations required access to land and labour and sometimes protection from competition. Strategic and geopolitical concerns also mattered. Control of key sea routes and naval bases—Suez, the Cape, Gibraltar—was essential for trade and the security of the empire, particularly the route to India, the “jewel in the crown.” Domestic political considerations influenced decisions too; imperial adventures could divert attention from internal problems, win votes, or satisfy an aggressive public opinion that equated empire with national prestige. Ideology and culture provided moral language for expansion. The “civilising mission,” missionary zeal, and notions of racial superiority legitimised rule for many contemporaries and were reflected in literature, public exhibitions and political debate. Finally, contingency and local factors played their part: opportunities were seized when local rulers weakened, as in Egypt in the 1880s, or when rival European powers threatened British interests, as during the scramble for Africa.

## Key historiographical debates and approaches
Students should be comfortable with competing interpretations because Component 3 demands analysis of historical approach and argument. The Hobson–Lenin thesis, influential in early 20th‑century Marxist writing, attributed imperialism to the economic needs of monopoly capitalism: surplus capital seeking investment abroad encouraged states to take colonies. Critics point out that much British investment flowed to open markets rather than colonies and that empire did not always produce clear financial returns. The “gentlemanly capitalism” argument (associated with Cain and Hopkins) shifts emphasis away from industrialists to the City of London, financial interests and service elites who shaped imperial policy, thus explaining the importance of informal empire and financial control. Other approaches stress strategic and political motives, or the agency of colonial peripheries: local elites, settlers, and indigenous resistance often drove imperial expansion and administration as much as metropolitan will. Cultural and gendered readings ask how ideas, representations and the roles of women (as missionaries, nurses, settlers and supporters of reform) helped sustain imperial ideology. A balanced answer typically recognises that several motives operated together and varied by time and place.

## How Britain ruled: institutions, methods and variation
British imperial administration was not uniform. Direct rule involved centralised colonial offices and British governors, as in many African colonies. Indirect rule, championed by administrators such as Lord Lugard in West Africa, relied on local rulers to administer under British supervision and was cheaper and often more acceptable where existing hierarchies could be co‑opted. Chartered companies—like the Royal Niger Company or the East Africa Company—acted as private administrators in earlier phases, later being absorbed by the Crown when responsibilities or costs rose. Settler colonies (South Africa, parts of East Africa) developed different institutions, with significant political influence for white settlers and long‑term implications for race relations. After the First World War the mandate system under the League of Nations formalised new kinds of imperial responsibility in former Ottoman and German territories. This diversity matters: the effects of imperialism and the sources historians use differ markedly between an India administered by a powerful civil service, a protectorate ruled via treaties, and a settler colony dominated by a white minority.

## Impacts on colonised societies: economy, politics, culture and resistance
The impact of British rule on colonised peoples was profound and multi‑layered. Economically, colonial policy often reoriented local economies to produce export crops or raw materials for British industry and to capture mineral wealth. This could bring infrastructure such as railways and ports but also caused displacement, soil exhaustion, and dependency. Politically, colonial rule dismantled or transformed indigenous institutions; it replaced or co‑opted traditional elites, introduced new legal systems and created new hierarchies of power. Socially and culturally, mission schools, missionary medicine and colonial education altered language use, religion and social mobility, producing a westernised elite who would later lead nationalist movements. Resistance took many forms: armed rebellions, such as the Mahdist and later anti‑colonial wars; passive or legal opposition; and the development of organised nationalism which from the late 19th and early 20th centuries crystallised into movements demanding self‑government. Examples include the Indian National Congress’s evolution into a mass nationalist force, African labour movements and anti‑settler struggles in places like Kenya and Rhodesia. The gendered impact is significant too: missionary and colonial discourses reshaped women’s roles, and imperial service created new spaces for women both to enforce and to challenge imperial rule. Overall, colonised societies experienced both modernising influences and long‑term distortions that shaped post‑colonial trajectories.

## Impact on Britain: economy, society and culture
Imperialism affected metropolitan Britain as well as the colonies. Economically, the Empire provided outlets for investment and access to resources, though the degree to which it prevented economic decline or produced sustained profits is debated. Politically, colonial affairs shaped parliamentary debates, party politics and public culture—imperial crises, wars and contests could influence elections and public opinion. Socially and culturally, empire permeated everyday life: newspapers, school curricula, public ceremonies, exhibitions and novels normalised imperial assumptions. The return of colonial troops after the First World War, and the employment of colonial migrants in cities, changed social interactions and raised new questions about race and citizenship. Women’s engagement with imperial causes deepened the connections between suffrage, philanthropy and moral reform. In short, imperialism reshaped Britain’s economy, politics and national identity even as it provoked criticism from anti‑imperialists and reformers.

## Why the Empire was changing and in decline by 1939
By 1939 clear signs of imperial strain and transformation were visible. The First World War was pivotal: colonies had contributed men and resources, and wartime sacrifices fuelled expectations of self‑government. The interwar period saw stronger nationalist movements, especially in India, demanding constitutional reform and independence, and colonial unrest in Africa and Asia. Economic factors also weakened the imperial project; the Great Depression exposed the vulnerabilities of export‑dependent colonial economies and reduced metropolitan investment. International opinion shifted—mandates and new norms constrained outright annexation, and anti‑imperialist rhetoric gained traction in diplomatic circles. Military and administrative costs increased, making formal control more burdensome. At the same time Britain adapted by expanding dominion status for settler colonies and developing informal mechanisms of influence—financial, diplomatic and commercial—where formal rule was costly or contested. By 1939 therefore the Empire had not disappeared but it was less secure, more contested and increasingly reconfigured in ways that set the stage for the large‑scale decolonisation that followed the Second World War.

## The balance sheet: gains, losses and contested legacies
Assessing who gained and who lost under the Empire is necessarily complex. Some colonised elites gained education, new careers and access to global markets; infrastructures such as railways and legal systems remained as durable legacies. Yet many peoples experienced dispossession, enforced labour, cultural disruption and economic structures that favoured metropolitan interests. Environmental changes and the incorporation of colonial economies into global systems often created long‑term challenges. For Britain, gains included markets, strategic advantage and cultural prestige, but at the cost of fiscal burdens, moral controversies and eventually international censure. The historiography reflects these tensions: some historians emphasise economic benefits and modernisation, while others stress exploitation and coercion. A careful evaluation acknowledges both the transformative developments associated with imperial rule and the injustices and distortions it imposed.

## Exam technique
To succeed in examination questions on this topic, combine clear factual knowledge with analysis of causation and impact and with awareness of historians’ interpretations. For causation questions start by outlining the multiple motives and then assess their relative importance using case studies: for example, use Egypt (1882) to illustrate strategic and financial motives, Africa (1880s scramble) to show rivalry and opportunity, and India to discuss long‑term administrative and economic dynamics. For impact questions structure answers thematically—economic, political, social, cultural—and support each theme with specific examples such as the Boer War, Indian nationalism, or mandate territories after 1919. When asked about interpretations, identify the historian’s approach, summarise the argument succinctly (for example, Hobson’s economic interpretation or the gentlemanly capitalism thesis), and evaluate it by testing its claims against evidence and alternative explanations. Use primary evidence where appropriate—government documents, speeches, economic statistics, contemporary press—or refer to well‑known incidents and legislation to underpin points. Always address the command words directly: explain, assess, evaluate, or how far. Plan essays with a brief introduction that sets out the argument, develop focused paragraphs that combine assertion, evidence and analysis, and finish with a conclusion that weighs the arguments and reaches a reasoned judgement. Time management is essential: allocate time to plan, write and proofread, and practise using past questions to refine the balance between breadth of knowledge and depth of argument.
