# The Search for International Peace and Security, 1919–1945 (A-level History Cambridge International)

## Overview and key themes

The period 1919–1945 is defined by two linked but contrasting endeavours: the attempt to build a stable international order after the devastation of the First World War, and the gradual unravelling of that order in the 1930s that culminated in the Second World War. Students should think about the intellectual and practical ideas of the time — collective security, disarmament, international law and arbitration — and about the political, economic and social forces that shaped whether those ideas could succeed. Central themes include the strengths and limits of international organisations, the role of national interests and power politics, the effects of economic crisis, and the impact of aggressive revisionist states (especially Japan, Italy and Germany). Evaluation of continuity and change is crucial: many of the institutions and debates of 1919 reappear in modified form in 1945, and understanding why some ideas survived while others failed is the heart of the topic.

## The League of Nations: origins and aims

The League of Nations emerged from the peace settlements of 1919 as the most explicit attempt yet to prevent war through a system of collective security and international cooperation. Influenced by President Woodrow Wilson’s idealism, the League aimed to outlaw war as an instrument of policy, to provide machinery for arbitration and dispute resolution, and to coordinate international action on humanitarian and economic problems. Its founding reflected both idealism and compromise. The Covenant combined ambitious language about disarmament and collective action with practical mechanisms, but it also embodied the anxieties and limits of victorious powers unwilling to surrender all instruments of sovereignty. Students should grasp the League’s dual identity: it was both a forum for moral and technical cooperation and an association of states whose willingness to act depended on self-interest and power.

## Organisation and membership: strengths and constraints

The League’s formal structure included the Assembly, the Council, a Permanent Secretariat, the Permanent Court of International Justice and numerous specialised agencies and commissions dealing with labour, health, refugees and mandates. These organs created an impressive institutional architecture for international governance and produced important practical achievements. Yet the League’s effectiveness was undermined from the start by the absence or limited engagement of key states. The United States never joined, despite Wilson’s leading role in designing the Covenant, because the Senate refused ratification. The exclusion of Bolshevik Russia, the delayed inclusion of Germany, and the selective application of collective measures revealed the League’s political fragility. Students should be able to explain how this mixture of technical competence and political weakness shaped the League’s record: it could coordinate social and legal projects but was often impotent in the face of determined aggression.

## Practical achievements: technical successes and their significance

Between the wars the League oversaw significant humanitarian and technical work that should not be overlooked. Commissions and agencies tackled problems of refugees, public health, labour standards and the administration of mandates. The International Labour Organization promoted labour legislation, the Health Organization fought disease, and the Mandates Commission supervised the administration of former Ottoman and German territories. These successes matter for two reasons. First, they show that international cooperation could deliver tangible benefits and helped to normalise transnational problem-solving. Second, they provide a useful contrast with the League’s political failures: practical governance proved possible in areas of expert administration, whereas collective security required political will that was often absent.

## Collective security, disarmament and diplomacy, 1919–1933

The immediate post-war years were shaped by debates over disarmament and the pursuit of security through binding agreements. The 1920s saw several important diplomatic initiatives intended to stabilise Europe and reduce the risk of war. The Washington Naval Conference sought to limit naval competition among great powers, while Locarno in 1925 secured Western frontiers and produced a mood of reconciliation. The Dawes and Young Plans attempted to settle German reparations and reintegrate Germany into the international economy. The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 declared war illegal in principle, reflecting the era’s legalist optimism. However, these measures depended on goodwill and did not resolve underlying security dilemmas. Disarmament conferences struggled because states were unwilling to sacrifice their security advantages, and economic instability after 1929 undermined the political consensus that had supported cooperation. Students should weigh achievements such as Locarno against structural weaknesses: agreements could stabilise certain relationships but did not create enforceable collective security across all regions and all states.

## The crisis of the 1930s: Manchuria, Abyssinia and the breakdown of collective security

The 1930s transformed diplomatic frustration into outright crisis. Japan’s invasion of Manchuria in 1931, following the staged Mukden incident, provoked a formal complaint to the League. The Lytton Commission’s report condemned Japanese actions but its recommendations were slow and ineffectual; Japan simply withdrew from the League in 1933. In 1935–36, Italy’s attack on Abyssinia tested the League again. Economic sanctions proved patchy and key powers, most notably Britain and France, were reluctant to impose measures that might push Italy into the German camp. The secretive Hoare–Laval discussions, which proposed a settlement favourable to Italy, when exposed, destroyed confidence in collective action. These episodes demonstrate why the League failed to deter aggression: decisions required unanimity or at least strong majorities; powerful states prioritised national interest and strategic positioning over principle; and economic sanctions lacked teeth without a willingness to use force or to deny vital resources. The international response to these crises taught revisionist states that the Western powers’ commitment to collective security had limits.

## Appeasement and the final collapse, 1936–1939

From the mid-1930s the policy of appeasement, most visibly embodied in British and French strategies toward Hitler, seemed a pragmatic attempt to buy time and avoid another catastrophic war. Rearmament, the trauma of the Great Depression, pacifist sentiment and the fear of communism all contributed to a reluctance to confront German aggression. The remilitarisation of the Rhineland in 1936, the Anschluss with Austria in 1938 and the Munich settlement over the Sudetenland in 1938 revealed both Hitler’s ambitions and the Western powers’ unwillingness to use force to stop revision. The Spanish Civil War, fighting that involved large-scale intervention by Germany and Italy, hardened ideological divisions and served as a rehearsal for modern combined arms warfare. The final collapse came with the Nazi–Soviet Pact of August 1939 and the German invasion of Poland in September, which led Britain and France to declare war. Students should interpret appeasement not as the simple failure of moral courage but as a complex policy choice shaped by domestic politics, economic constraints and strategic calculation; nonetheless, it failed to prevent general war.

## From wartime cooperation to the United Nations

Wartime alliance and the shared goal of defeating the Axis powers created space for a new international settlement. Leaders such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and later Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin envisaged an organisation with stronger powers than the League had possessed. The Atlantic Charter of 1941 and subsequent inter-Allied conferences laid out principles of self-determination and economic cooperation. The United Nations, formally founded in 1945 at San Francisco, learned from the League’s weaknesses by establishing a Security Council whose permanent members — the main wartime victors — would have primary responsibility for maintaining peace and a veto to secure their participation. The UN combined a broader membership and retained specialised agencies that continued the technical work pioneered by the League. Yet the Security Council’s structure also institutionalised great power rivalry and the veto has at times hindered decisive action. Understanding continuity and change between the League and the UN is essential: many institutional ideas survived, but the balance between collective ideals and great-power politics remained the determining factor.

## Exam technique

When answering source-based or essay questions on this topic, begin by setting the issue in its broader historical context and make clear the focus of your response. For document questions, treat part (a) as an opportunity to interrogate the sources closely: consider content, tone, purpose and provenance and how these features affect reliability. Use specific details from each source and compare them where useful, then bring in your own contextual knowledge to test their claims. For part (b) of the document question you must synthesise source evidence with wider factual knowledge to assess the given statement’s validity; avoid simply narrating events and aim to weigh the relative strength of source evidence against other relevant facts. For essay questions, construct a clear argument with an explicit line of reasoning that addresses the question throughout. Balance description with analysis and make sure each paragraph advances your argument. Always evaluate the significance of factors rather than listing them: explain why an action succeeded or failed, and consider alternative explanations. Time management is essential: allocate time in proportion to the marks available, leave a few minutes at the end to proofread, and when relevant, use short, precise supporting examples such as the Lytton Report, Abyssinia, Locarno, the Kellogg–Briand Pact, the Munich Agreement and the foundation of the UN to anchor your analysis. Finally, show awareness of historiographical debate where appropriate by noting differing interpretations about causes, motives and consequences; this demonstrates deeper understanding and lifts answers to the highest band.
