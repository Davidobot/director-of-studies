# Migration: causes and impacts (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## Key terms and types of migration
Migration is the movement of people from one place to another with the intention of settling temporarily or permanently. It is important to be clear about the terms used: emigration is leaving a country or area, immigration is entering one; internal migration occurs within a country, while international migration crosses national borders. Some movements are voluntary, such as labour migration for better wages, and others are forced, such as refugees fleeing war or persecution. Asylum seekers are people who request protection in another country and await a decision; if their claim is accepted they become refugees. Other categories include seasonal and circular migrants who move for work for part of the year and then return, and internally displaced persons (IDPs) who are forced from their homes but remain inside their national borders. Understanding these distinctions helps to explain why people move and how societies respond.

## Causes of migration: push and pull factors
Geographers often explain migration using push and pull factors. Push factors are negative conditions that encourage people to leave an area; pull factors are attractive features that draw people to a new place. Economic push factors include unemployment, low wages and a lack of opportunities, while economic pull factors include the availability of jobs, higher pay and better career prospects. Social causes such as poor access to education and healthcare, or the desire to join family already living elsewhere, can also drive migration. Political causes include conflict, persecution and state collapse; these produce forced migrants and refugees. Environmental drivers range from sudden disasters like earthquakes and floods to slow-onset pressures such as desertification and sea-level rise. Often people move because of a mixture of reasons: for example, drought that damages livelihoods (environmental push) combined with existing job networks in a city (social pull) will encourage rural–urban migration.

## Patterns and flows of migration
Migration creates distinctive spatial patterns and flows at local, national and global scales. Internally, many countries experience large rural–urban flows as agricultural workers move to towns and cities seeking work and services; this process contributes to urbanisation and the growth of megacities. Internationally, flows often follow economic gradients from lower-income to higher-income countries, for example labour migration from parts of South Asia to the Gulf states or from Mexico and Central America to the United States. Some flows are regional and directional, such as post-colonial migration from former colonies to metropolitan centres in Europe, while others are temporary and circular, like seasonal agricultural workers who cross borders each year. Migration can also be chained: one family member moves first, establishes contacts and finances, and then brings others. Routes and volumes change over time in response to changing labour demands, conflicts, policy decisions and environmental change, so migration patterns are dynamic rather than fixed.

## Impacts on origin areas
Migration produces a range of effects in the places people leave. One immediate demographic impact is a change in age and sex structure: younger working-age people are often the most mobile, so origin areas may experience a rise in dependency ratios if older people and children remain, and a loss of productive labour. This can reduce local economic activity and slow development. However, remittances—money sent home by migrants—are often a major economic benefit for origin communities, supporting household incomes, education and small businesses and sometimes providing foreign exchange for national economies. There are social consequences too: prolonged family separation affects household structures and gender roles, as women may take on new responsibilities or households become dependent on remittance income. In some places skilled migration leads to brain drain, where essential professionals such as doctors and teachers leave, weakening public services. At the same time, the departure of people can relieve pressure on limited local resources, depending on the context, and in the long term return migration can bring new skills and investment back to the origin.

## Impacts on destination areas and on migrants themselves
Receiving areas also feel strong effects. Economically, migrants supply labour, sometimes filling low-paid and low-status jobs that are hard to fill locally and at other times bringing specialised skills that drive innovation. This can boost economic growth and increase cultural diversity, enriching cities with new businesses, cuisines and cultural practices. However, rapid inflows of people can put pressure on housing, health, education and transport services, especially where planning and investment do not keep pace with population change. Social impacts include both positive outcomes, such as cultural exchange and multicultural communities, and negative outcomes, such as social tension, discrimination and competition for jobs. The experience for migrants themselves varies greatly: some find improved living standards, legal protection and new opportunities, while others face exploitation, insecure work, poor housing and barriers to integration, especially if they are undocumented. Demographically, destinations may benefit from a younger migrant workforce that helps to rebalance ageing populations, but this requires adequate social and economic integration to be a sustainable advantage.

## Management, policies and responses
Governments and organisations manage migration through a range of policies and responses that reflect economic priorities, humanitarian obligations and political pressures. Policies may seek to control borders and reduce irregular migration through enforcement, visa rules and transit agreements, or to attract particular skills through targeted visas and points-based systems. Guest worker and seasonal worker programmes are used to meet labour demand while limiting permanent settlement. Refugee protection is guided by international law and conventions, which oblige states to provide asylum and non-refoulement, but states vary in how they process claims, provide support, and use resettlement. At the local level, urban planning, housing policy and social services are crucial to managing internal rural–urban migration and the needs of newcomers. Development-centred approaches address root causes by investing in education, healthcare and employment opportunities to reduce forced economic migration, while integration policies focus on language training, anti-discrimination measures and pathways to citizenship. Effective management recognises that migration is a long-standing component of human societies and seeks to balance rights, responsibilities and practical capacity.

## Migration in context: the Syrian refugee crisis as a case study
The Syrian refugee crisis since 2011 is a key example of international migration driven primarily by conflict and political collapse. As civil war escalated, millions of Syrians fled their homes; many became internally displaced, while others crossed international borders to neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. These nearby states experienced sudden and large population increases that placed strain on housing, healthcare, education and employment. For example, schools and clinics struggled to serve both host communities and refugees, and local labour markets adjusted to the influx of workers. At the same time, international aid, humanitarian organisations and some hosting governments provided emergency support, while wealthier countries offered resettlement places for a fraction of refugees. The crisis produced wide-ranging effects in Syria itself, including the collapse of services, loss of skilled workers and long-term demographic change. In Europe the arrival of refugees prompted intense political debate about border control, asylum procedures and integration, showing how forced migration can reshape politics and public attitudes across regions. The Syrian example highlights how migration flows can be sudden, large-scale and complex, involving short-term humanitarian needs and long-term social, economic and political consequences.

## Teaching and learning points to deepen understanding
To teach migration effectively, it helps to connect theory with concrete, local and international examples. Use push–pull frameworks to structure explanations and encourage students to identify multiple causes behind a single movement. Explore population models and demographic consequences by showing how migration interacts with birth and death rates; for example, present the equation for population change and demonstrate how net migration can alter population size and structure. Encourage students to examine both positive and negative impacts on origin and destination areas, and to consider the migrant’s perspective, including issues of identity, rights and integration. Fieldwork, class surveys and local case studies make the topic tangible: students can investigate recent arrivals in their own town, map patterns of settlement, or analyse news reports and statistics to build balanced assessments. Linking migration to other topics such as urbanisation, development and the environment will help students see migration as a cross-cutting theme in human geography.

## Exam technique
In exams, start answers by defining key terms and setting out whether you are discussing internal or international migration; clarity at the start wins marks. For causes and impacts, use the push–pull approach to structure paragraphs and support each point with a specific example or case study detail—this shows AO1 knowledge and meets AO3 judgement criteria. When a question asks for explanation, use cause–effect chains: explain the factor, show how it leads to movement, and then describe the consequence for origin or destination. For resource-based questions, interpret the data carefully before linking it to general concepts. In evaluation questions, balance positive and negative impacts and consider different stakeholders’ perspectives, finishing with a reasoned judgement that reflects evidence. When using a case study, be concrete: name the place, outline the reasons for migration, describe measurable impacts and, where possible, include dates or approximate scales (for example, “millions displaced” rather than vague language). Time-manage by allocating minutes to planning, writing and checking; shorter answers should still include a clear definition, an organised argument and a concluding sentence. Finally, practise past-paper questions, focus on command words (such as explain, assess, suggest) and ensure you use geographical vocabulary and place-specific detail to secure high marks.
