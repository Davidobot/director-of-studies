# Economic development, indicators and globalisation (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## What economic development means and why it matters
Economic development describes the process by which a country improves the economic, political and social well‑being of its people. It is more than simply getting richer: development involves better health, longer life expectancy, greater access to education, improved infrastructure, and more secure livelihoods. At the simplest level development is linked to increases in national income and changes in what people do for work, but the full picture includes changes in quality of life and in the opportunities people have. Understanding development matters because it helps explain why countries differ in wealth and living standards, why migration and urbanisation occur, and what policy choices can reduce poverty while protecting the environment.

## How development is measured: indicators and their limits
Development is assessed using a range of indicators, each giving a different perspective. Economic measures such as GNP or GNI per capita summarise the average income in a country and are useful for comparing relative wealth. Social indicators such as literacy rates, school enrolment and life expectancy show human development outcomes. Composite indices, most commonly the Human Development Index (HDI), combine income with health and education to give a broader measure of well‑being. Other useful statistics include infant mortality, access to clean water and the percentage of people living below a poverty line. All indicators have limits: averages can hide deep internal inequalities, some metrics do not capture informal economies that are important in many poorer countries, and comparisons in currency terms can be distorted by exchange rates. Because of these limitations, exam answers should use a mix of indicators and explain what each one does and does not reveal about a country’s development.

## Why countries and regions differ: causes of inequality
Differences in development arise from a complex mix of physical, historical, economic and political factors. Natural resources, climate and relief can make agriculture productive or difficult, and coastal access often supports trade and growth. Historical factors such as colonialism and trade patterns have shaped institutions and infrastructure. Economic policies, political stability and the quality of governance affect investment, education and public services. Human capital—skills, health and education—also matters: a better‑educated workforce attracts higher value industries. At the regional scale within countries, urban areas tend to concentrate jobs, services and infrastructure, leading to uneven development and internal migration. When explaining inequalities in an exam, combine general causes with specific examples to show how factors interact to produce different outcomes in different places.

## Employment structure and economic sectors
An important indicator of economic development is employment structure, the proportions of people working in primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary sectors. In low‑income economies a large share of the workforce is employed in primary activities such as subsistence farming and extractive industries. As development proceeds, secondary industry—manufacturing—grows, often driven by urbanisation and industrialisation. In more developed economies the service sector dominates, and quaternary activities involving research, information technology and finance become important. The shifting share of employment reflects changes in productivity, technology and consumer demand. When answering exam questions, describe the pattern of structural change and explain why the proportions employed in each sector differ between poorer and richer countries, using examples to support your points.

## Globalisation: processes, drivers and effects
Globalisation is the increasing integration of economies through trade, investment, technology and the movement of people and ideas. Key drivers include improvements in transport and communications, the removal of trade barriers, the spread of multinational corporations, and advances in information technology. Transnational corporations (TNCs) play a central role by locating production, services and research across multiple countries to take advantage of lower costs, skilled labour or proximity to markets. Globalisation brings benefits: expanded markets, technology transfer, foreign direct investment, and often job creation in developing countries. It also brings challenges: local industries can be undermined by competition, working conditions may be poor in some locations, and profits from activity can flow to headquarters rather than remaining in the host country. In exam answers, demonstrate balanced thinking by describing both positive and negative impacts at local, national and global scales and by using a concrete TNC case study to illustrate the links and flows involved.

## Impacts of development and globalisation on people and the environment
Economic development and global connections change landscapes and livelihoods. Positive social impacts can include reduced poverty, better health and greater access to services. Economically, development can diversify income sources and create jobs outside agriculture. Environmental and social costs can include deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution, increased greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity, especially when development emphasises short‑term gains over long‑term sustainability. Urban growth can create slums and increase demand for water and energy. Global supply chains can encourage overexploitation of resources and can shift environmental burdens to poorer places. Sustainable development aims to balance economic growth with social equity and environmental protection. In your revision notes and exam answers you should be able to give examples of strategies that reduce negative impacts, for example renewable energy projects, reforestation schemes, improved waste management, fair trade practices and regulation of industry.

## Using case studies effectively
Case studies are essential in exam answers because they provide specific, place‑based evidence that examiners look for. For the topic of globalisation you will be asked to refer to a transnational corporation and its global links. Choose one or two clear examples and learn the core facts: where the company is headquartered, where its main factories or suppliers are located, the types of products or services it provides, and the positive and negative impacts it has in host countries. For instance, a multinational electronics firm might be based in one country, manufacture components in several lower‑cost countries and sell products worldwide; this creates employment and brings technology but may also raise questions about worker safety and environmental harm. For development indicators learn a country or region case study that illustrates contrasts—such as differing levels of HDI, unequal access to services within a country, or the effects of an industry on a local environment. In answers, integrate the case study to support your explanation rather than using it as a list of facts: show how the example proves or complicates the point you are making.

## Exam technique
Answering questions well requires combining knowledge with skills of analysis and judgement. Read each question carefully and use the command words to guide your response: words such as describe ask for features and characteristics, explain asks for reasons and causes, and evaluate or assess asks for balanced judgement. For short answer questions aim to be precise and refer to specific indicators or mechanisms; for longer answers organise your writing with a clear introduction, developed paragraphs and a concise conclusion. When using data or resources, make sure your interpretation is based on the evidence provided and refer directly to figures, trends or features shown. Always include case study detail where appropriate—named places, firms or projects help lift answers into higher mark bands—but keep the detail accurate and relevant. For questions requiring judgement, present both sides of an argument before reaching a reasoned conclusion that links back to the question. Manage your time by noting the marks available and allocating time accordingly; use the sub‑marks printed on some exam questions as a guide to the level of detail required. Finally, practice answering past paper questions under timed conditions and use examiner feedback or mark schemes to refine your balance of description, explanation and evaluation.
