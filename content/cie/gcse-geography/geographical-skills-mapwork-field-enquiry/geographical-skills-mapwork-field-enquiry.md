# Geographical skills, mapwork and field enquiry (Paper 2 / Coursework) (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

Geographical skills, mapwork and field enquiry form the practical heart of Cambridge IGCSE Geography. Paper 2 tests your ability to read, interpret and analyse geographical information presented in maps, photographs, graphs and tables, while the coursework (Component 3) or its written alternative (Paper 4) assesses your ability to plan and carry out a small-scale geographical investigation. Together these components develop the techniques you will use in the real world: locating and describing places, recognising patterns in data, selecting appropriate ways to show information and making reasoned conclusions. The emphasis is on applying general geographical knowledge to unfamiliar resources, using appropriate field and map techniques, and demonstrating observational, analytical and evaluative skills.

A secure command of large-scale mapwork is essential for Paper 2. The maps provided are normally at scales of 1:25 000 or 1:50 000 and contain a full key; you must be able to read and use the key to identify land use, transport routes, settlement morphology and natural features. Grid references are used to locate features precisely: four-figure references locate a square on the map and six-figure references identify a point within that square by dividing the eastings and northings into tenths. Directions should be given using the 16-point compass (for example north, north‑east, east) or as bearings from grid north; a protractor is therefore an essential tool in the exam. Measuring distance is most accurate with a straight-edged piece of paper and the map’s scale line, especially when the route is curved, and contour interpretation lets you calculate differences in height and draw cross-sections to show valley and ridge profiles. Knowing common map symbols, recognising patterns of relief and drainage, and being able to translate map evidence into clear written description are all tested in the mapwork question, which contributes a large proportion of Paper 2 marks.

Interpreting a wide range of resources is a core skill. Questions will ask you to read and interpret topographic maps, satellite images, vertical and oblique photographs, graphs (line, bar, divided bar, histogram, scatter with best-fit), population pyramids, choropleth maps, isoline maps and tables of data. When you describe a graph or map you should identify broad patterns first and then give specific details to support your statements. For example, when looking at a population pyramid you should comment on the distribution of age groups and any notable differences between males and females, then interpret what that structure implies about dependency ratios and future population trends. When working with scatter graphs, look for the trend and whether the relationship is positive or negative, strong or weak, and consider any outliers. Photographs are used to prompt concise description and informed inference: from a street scene you might identify land use, building height, evidence of traffic pressure or green space, and use that evidence to suggest likely functions of the area.

Field enquiry is the practical route to geographical understanding and is the basis for successful coursework. A good investigation follows the established route to geographical enquiry: identify a clear issue or question, develop specific aims and hypotheses, plan methods and sampling carefully, collect primary and/or secondary data, present the findings using appropriate techniques, analyse and interpret the results in the light of geographical theory, and draw reasoned conclusions with evaluation and suggestions for further work. Typical fieldwork techniques include questionnaires to measure opinions or behaviour, structured observations and environmental quality surveys, pedestrian and traffic counts, and measurements such as river width, depth and flow velocity, beach profiles and pebble size. Sampling strategy is critical: you must justify whether you used random, systematic or stratified sampling and explain how it helps you test your hypothesis. Practicalities such as health and safety, permissions, equipment calibration and keeping detailed field notes are part of good practice and must be recorded in coursework.

Presenting and analysing data convincingly is what elevates good coursework to excellent coursework. Choose presentation methods that match your data and make patterns clear: line graphs work well for time series, histograms for frequency, scatter graphs for relationships, and maps or choropleths for spatial distributions. A well-labelled cross-section or annotated sketch can communicate relief and landform relationships more clearly than paragraphs alone. Use summary statistics where appropriate: means and ranges show central tendency and spread, and simple calculations such as percentage change or rates help quantify trends. Analysis should go beyond description to explain why patterns exist, linking findings to geographical processes such as erosion and deposition in river studies or push–pull factors in migration enquiries. Evaluation is essential: discuss the reliability and validity of your methods, acknowledge limitations such as small sample sizes or measurement error, and suggest practical improvements or extensions that could deepen the investigation.

Mathematical and practical skills underpin much of the assessment in Paper 2 and coursework. You will be expected to add, subtract, multiply and divide confidently and to use fractions, percentages and ratios. Map scale must be interpreted correctly, whether reading a scale line or converting a representative fraction to real distances. When calculating river discharge you will use the formula discharge equals cross-sectional area multiplied by mean velocity, and when plotting cross-sections you will translate map distances and contour values into accurate profiles. Instruments commonly used in fieldwork include clinometers for slope measurement, tape measures for distance, flow meters for velocity, quadrats for ecological studies and the standard weather instruments such as Stevenson screens, rain gauges and anemometers. Calculators are allowed in exams, and a ruler and protractor are essential in the exam room for map questions and bearings.

Understanding how your work will be assessed helps you focus on what matters. The three assessment objectives of AO1 (knowledge with understanding), AO2 (skills and analysis) and AO3 (judgement and decision-making) are tested across the written papers and coursework. Coursework and the alternative to coursework place particular emphasis on AO2 and AO3, so your assignment should demonstrate well-planned data collection, competent use of a range of presentation techniques, thorough analysis and balanced evaluation. Coursework is marked against levels that reflect increasing quality: a basic submission describes and records simple information with limited planning and simple presentation, a competent submission collects relevant data with sound planning, uses several presentation techniques and provides valid explanations, while an excellent submission presents comprehensive data from a range of sources with clear planning, coherent use of a wide range of presentation techniques, thoroughly reasoned interpretation and a well-argued evaluation that suggests improvements or further lines of enquiry. Coursework must be your own work, typically up to 2000 words, and although teachers may provide general guidance and feedback, they must not correct or produce draft content for candidates. Centres must internally moderate marks when multiple teachers mark coursework and submit a sample for external moderation.

Practically preparing for Paper 2 and coursework requires regular practice with past-style resources and hands-on fieldwork. In the exam room, read each question carefully and pay attention to the marks allocated to each part; sub-marks indicate the level of detail required and help you pace your answers. For the map question, base every point on map evidence only: avoid bringing in unrelated regional knowledge. In coursework, select a focused question that allows clear hypotheses to be tested within the available time and resources; local topics are often the most achievable because they make data collection feasible. Maintain accuracy in recording, label every graph and map meticulously, and use annotation to link visual evidence to your interpretations. Photographs and field sketches add value when they are used to support explanations rather than merely decorate the report.

## Exam technique

Approach Paper 2 with a calm, methodical strategy. Start by scanning the whole paper to see how the time should be divided, noting the mapwork question and the other resource-based tasks. For the mapwork question, always quote grid references when pinpointing features, use the scale line or paper-measuring technique for distances, and show your working when calculating height differences or constructing cross-sections. When interpreting graphs and tables, begin with an overview sentence that summarises the main trend, then provide specific evidence with values and units. Use geographical vocabulary correctly: terms such as “discharge”, “gradient”, “nucleated”, “threshold population” or “confluent” carry weight when applied appropriately. Where the question invites evaluation or solutions, link your suggestions to the evidence you have presented and consider feasibility, costs and social or environmental consequences. For coursework-related responses in Paper 1 and Paper 2, succinctly reference your case study details so examiners can see clear, relevant examples; when describing your field methods in Paper 4 or coursework write-ups, explain sampling rationale and demonstrate awareness of reliability. Time management is essential: allocate time proportional to marks, leave a few minutes at the end to check calculations and ensure all diagrams are labelled, and remember that neat, clear presentation helps examiners follow your reasoning. With steady practice of map skills, data handling and the enquiry process, you will be well prepared to show the practical geography skills that these components assess.
