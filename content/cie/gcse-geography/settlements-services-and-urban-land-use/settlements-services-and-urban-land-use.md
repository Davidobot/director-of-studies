# Settlements, services and urban land use (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## Overview: why settlements matter
Settlements are places where people live and work, ranging from tiny villages to sprawling megacities. Understanding settlements helps explain how people organise space, access services and respond to economic and environmental change. Settlements are shaped by their physical site and wider situation, by human activities such as trade, industry and governance, and by processes such as migration and urbanisation. Studying settlements at GCSE level involves recognising patterns on maps and photographs, interpreting data about people and services, and evaluating how planners and communities manage change. Throughout this topic you will link knowledge (what things are and where they are) with skills (map work, data handling, field observation) and judgement (weighing advantages, disadvantages and trade-offs).

## Settlement patterns, site and situation
Settlement patterns describe how buildings and homes are arranged on the landscape. A nucleated settlement clusters around a centre such as a market, church or crossroads and is common where social interaction or defence was once important. Linear settlements form along transport routes such as roads, rivers or coastlines. Dispersed settlements are scattered, often in agricultural regions with large farms. Every settlement has a site—the physical location, for example on a hill, in a valley or at a river confluence—and a situation, the wider connections that link it to other places, such as roads, ports or nearby resources. A good site protects from flooding or provides fresh water; a favourable situation offers access to trade routes or raw materials. When you describe a settlement’s origin and growth, refer to both site and situation because both explain why a place developed where it did and how it has changed over time.

## Functions of settlements, hierarchy and services
Settlements perform different functions: they might be administrative centres, market towns, industrial hubs, ports, tourist resorts or bedroom communities for nearby cities. The hierarchy of settlements ranks places by size and the variety of services they provide. Small villages offer low-order goods and services such as a corner shop or primary school; larger towns and cities supply more specialised, high-order services like hospitals, universities and major shopping centres. Two key ideas to remember are threshold—the minimum population needed to support a service—and sphere of influence—the area from which a settlement draws customers. Central place theory is a useful model to explain why services are distributed unevenly: high-order services are rarer and farther apart because they need larger thresholds, while low-order services are common and close to people. When assessing service provision in an area, consider accessibility by transport, income levels, population density and historical factors.

## Urban land-use structures and models
Urban land uses arrange themselves according to economic forces, history and transport links. Classic urban models help you visualise typical patterns even though real cities rarely match them perfectly. The concentric zone model imagines rings of land use with the Central Business District (CBD) at the centre, older housing nearby and suburbs at the outer edge. The sector model suggests that certain activities grow in wedges or sectors along transport routes, while the multiple nuclei model proposes that cities develop several centres (nuclei) such as industrial parks, out-of-town retail centres and specialised districts. In many developed-country cities there is a clear CBD with high land values and tall buildings, inner-city areas that may have old housing and industry, suburbs dominated by residential zones, and a rural–urban fringe where urban sprawl, business parks and farmland meet. In rapidly growing cities of developing countries, central areas may contain a mix of formal offices and informal markets, while squatter settlements or informal housing often expand on the urban periphery. The bid-rent theory explains why land values generally fall with distance from the centre: businesses pay more to be central because of accessibility and customer flows, and this influences building height and land use.

## Urban growth, urbanisation and the rural–urban continuum
Urban growth is driven by natural increase and by migration, especially rural–urban migration as people seek jobs and services. Urbanisation alters the social and physical landscape: agricultural land is converted to housing and industry, commuting patterns develop, and lifestyles change. Rapid growth in developing-country cities can create both opportunities—access to employment, education and healthcare—and challenges, such as shortages of affordable housing, pressure on infrastructure and environmental degradation. The rural–urban continuum recognises that change is gradual rather than absolute: suburbs, peri-urban zones and exurbs form a gradient between clear urban cores and rural hinterlands. Planning responses to growth include containment measures such as green belts to limit sprawl, and promotion of higher-density, mixed-use development to make better use of land and reduce commute distances.

## Problems in urban areas and strategies to manage them
Cities face a range of interlinked problems that vary by wealth and governance. Traffic congestion and inadequate public transport lead to lost time, air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Housing shortages and affordability issues can produce overcrowding, homelessness or the growth of informal settlements where basic services are absent. Pollution of air, water and soil can harm health and ecosystems, while social inequality can create spatial segregation and tensions. Managing these problems requires a mix of policies and practical measures. Transport solutions include improving public transport networks, promoting cycling and walking, and using demand management such as congestion charging. Housing strategies range from slum upgrading and secure land tenure to promoting affordable housing schemes and brownfield redevelopment. Environmental measures include sustainable drainage systems to reduce flooding, urban greening to improve air quality and microclimates, and stricter pollution controls on industry and vehicles. Effective approaches often combine local community involvement with strategic planning and investment; examples vary from transit-oriented development in cities that prioritise rail and bus corridors to integrated water and sanitation projects in rapidly urbanising areas.

## Urban planning, sustainability and examples of good practice
Sustainable urban planning aims to balance economic development with social equity and environmental protection. Key principles are compact and mixed-use development, efficient public transport, protection of green spaces, and resilient infrastructure that can cope with climate change. Case studies often used in lessons include cities where innovative policies have produced measurable benefits. For example, a city that invested in a reliable bus rapid transit system reduced private car use and improved air quality while increasing access to jobs. Regeneration of brownfield land in inner cities can provide new housing and services without expanding the urban footprint. Community-led upgrading projects in informal settlements that provide water, sanitation and secure tenure can dramatically improve living conditions. When evaluating such examples in exams or coursework, consider the scale of impact, who benefits and who may lose out, the cost and feasibility, and whether the solutions are transferable to other contexts.

## Fieldwork, data and skills for this topic
Practical geographical skills are essential for understanding settlements and urban land use. Fieldwork might include land-use surveys along a transect from a town centre to the outskirts, pedestrian counts to assess activity levels in a shopping street, questionnaires to explore resident satisfaction with services, and mapping of green spaces or flood risk. In the classroom you will practise interpreting maps, aerial photographs and satellite images to identify land-use zones and transport patterns. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to combine layers of data—population, services, transport—to analyse spatial relationships. You should be confident with simple calculations such as population density, percentage change, mean and range, and with presenting data in graphs or annotated diagrams. When preparing coursework or answering Paper 4-style questions, follow the route to geographical enquiry: define aims and hypotheses, plan methods, collect and present data appropriately, analyse results, and draw reasoned conclusions that consider limitations and suggest further work.

## Exam technique
In exams, begin by reading each question carefully and noting command words such as describe, explain, suggest or evaluate, because they tell you the expected approach. For describe questions focus on clear factual detail and spatial patterns; for explain questions give reasons and link cause to effect; for evaluate questions balance advantages and disadvantages and reach a justified judgement. Use your case studies: a well-chosen example can support answers across many questions, but make sure the detail is relevant and precise. When using maps, photographs or resources, rely on the information provided and tie your observations back to geographical theory and processes. Time management is crucial: use the sub-mark allocations as a guide to how much detail is required, and plan short introductions for longer answers that define key terms. Include simple annotated diagrams or labelled sketches where helpful, because they can convey spatial relationships concisely. In data and skills questions, show your working for calculations and describe trends with reference to actual figures or clear comparative language. For higher-mark questions aim to integrate knowledge, skills and judgement by combining factual content with analysis and a brief evaluation. Finally, practise past papers under timed conditions, review examiner feedback to learn common pitfalls, and always check your answers for clarity and accuracy before submitting.
