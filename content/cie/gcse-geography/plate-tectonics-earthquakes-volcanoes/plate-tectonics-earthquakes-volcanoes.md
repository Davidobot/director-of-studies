# Plate tectonics, earthquakes and volcanoes (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## An overview of the Earth as a dynamic planet
The Earth's surface is not a single solid shell but a mosaic of moving plates floating on a hotter, more plastic layer of the mantle. This large-scale movement, known as plate tectonics, is the unifying theory that explains the global pattern of earthquakes, volcanoes and many large-scale landforms. Heat from the deep interior of the Earth drives slow convection currents in the mantle; these, together with forces such as slab pull and ridge push, cause plates to move relative to one another. The interaction of plates at their boundaries concentrates stress and magma, producing the majority of the world's seismic and volcanic activity. Recognising this framework helps explain why certain regions, like the Pacific ‘Ring of Fire’, have frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions while others, such as the middle of tectonic plates, are largely quiet except where hotspots create volcanoes.

## Plate structure and the main types of plate boundaries
The Earth is composed of an inner core, an outer core, the mantle and the crust. The crust and the rigid uppermost mantle together form the lithosphere, which is broken into tectonic plates. Plate boundaries are broadly classified by how plates move relative to each other. At constructive or divergent boundaries, plates move apart and magma rises to create new oceanic crust; the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East African Rift illustrate this process. At destructive or convergent boundaries, an oceanic plate usually sinks (subducts) beneath another plate, producing deep ocean trenches, volcanic mountain chains and powerful earthquakes; the Andes and the Japan subduction zone are classic examples. At conservative or transform boundaries, plates slide past one another, generating shear stress and often large earthquakes but normally without volcanic activity; the San Andreas Fault in California is an iconic transform fault. In addition to boundary-related activity, some volcanoes arise above mantle plumes or hotspots, producing chains of islands such as Hawaii, where volcanism can occur far from plate margins.

## Earthquakes: causes, features and how we measure them
Earthquakes occur when accumulated stress in the crust is suddenly released, usually along faults. The point within the Earth where rupture starts is the focus (or hypocentre), and the point directly above it on the surface is the epicentre. Energy from an earthquake radiates as seismic waves: primary (P) waves, which are faster and travel through solids and liquids, and secondary (S) waves, which are slower and travel only through solids; surface waves that follow cause most of the shaking felt on the ground. Seismographs record these waves and allow scientists to determine the location, depth and magnitude of an event. Magnitude is a measure of the energy released by an earthquake; the modern scale commonly used is the moment magnitude (Mw), which has largely replaced the original Richter scale. Intensity describes the local effects of shaking and damage, for example as measured by the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale; the same earthquake can cause very different intensities in different places, depending on distance from the epicentre, depth of the focus, local geology and building standards. Shallow earthquakes close to populated areas are often the most destructive. Secondary hazards such as tsunamis, landslides and fires can cause additional loss of life and damage, as demonstrated by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

## Volcanoes: types, features, eruption styles and distribution
Volcanoes form where magma reaches or nears the Earth's surface. The main parts of a volcano include the magma chamber, conduits and vents, and the crater at the summit. Two broad types of volcano dominate GCSE study: shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes (also called composite cones). Shield volcanoes have gentle slopes and are built by low-viscosity, basaltic lava that flows easily; eruptions tend to be less explosive and produce extensive lava fields, as on Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Stratovolcanoes are steep-sided and built from alternating layers of viscous andesitic or rhyolitic lava, ash and pyroclastic material; they are associated with subduction zones and can produce violent explosive eruptions, pyroclastic flows and large amounts of ash, as seen at Mount St Helens in 1980. Volcanoes are distributed largely along plate boundaries: constructive margins produce fissure volcanism and basaltic crust, convergent margins produce the arc volcanoes of island arcs and continental mountain chains, and transform boundaries normally lack volcanism. Hotspots are exceptions to this pattern and explain linear island chains produced as plates move over a relatively stationary plume of hot mantle.

## Hazards, impacts and the opportunities volcanoes and earthquakes bring
Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions cause a wide range of primary and secondary impacts. Primary earthquake effects include ground shaking, surface rupture and collapse of buildings. Secondary effects include tsunamis, landslides and fires. Primary volcanic effects include lava flows, ash fall, pyroclastic flows and gas emissions; secondary effects include lahars (volcanic mudflows), long-term ash damage to agriculture and disruption to transport by ash clouds. You should be able to distinguish between immediate impacts — such as fatalities, collapsed buildings, and road damage — and longer-term consequences like homelessness, economic loss, interrupted education, and environmental degradation. Despite their hazards, volcanic areas also provide important opportunities. Volcanic soils are often very fertile and support productive agriculture. Geothermal energy can supply clean electricity and heat in volcanic regions such as Iceland. Volcanic landscapes also attract tourists and can yield valuable mineral deposits. In many case studies, communities balance these benefits and risks, making decisions about land use, economic development and safety.

## Reducing risk: monitoring, prediction and planning
Although it is not possible to prevent earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, their impacts can be reduced by scientific monitoring, early warning systems, planning and appropriate construction. Earthquake risk is lowered by enforcing building codes designed to withstand shaking, retrofitting older structures and creating public education programmes for evacuation and emergency response. Seismometer networks, GPS measurements and studies of past earthquakes help identify areas of higher risk and produce probabilistic forecasts. For volcanoes, monitoring includes tracking seismic activity, measuring ground deformation with tiltmeters and satellites, and sampling volcanic gases to detect rising magma. These data can give warnings of imminent eruption, allowing evacuations and other actions to reduce casualties. Land-use planning to avoid development on unstable slopes or flood-prone volcanic lahar paths, the provision of shelters and stockpiled supplies, and well-rehearsed evacuation routes all contribute to more effective responses. International cooperation and rapid post-disaster assistance are also essential because major disasters can overwhelm local resources.

## Case studies and how to choose them for revision
To meet the syllabus requirements you should study at least one earthquake and one volcano case study in detail, using them to illustrate processes, impacts and management. Choose a modern, well-documented example so you can describe primary and secondary effects and judge the success of mitigation strategies. For earthquakes, focus on aspects such as tectonic setting, magnitude, depth, numbers affected, types of damage, short- and long-term responses and lessons learned; contrasting a high-income example such as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in Japan with a low-income example such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake highlights how wealth, governance and preparedness alter outcomes. For volcanoes, compare a constructive margin eruption like the relatively effusive eruptions in Iceland with a subduction-related explosive eruption such as Mount Pinatubo (1991) or Mount St Helens (1980). In each case, explain why the hazard occurred where it did (link to plate tectonics), what monitoring and warning systems existed, and how local geography and human factors affected the scale of the disaster and the recovery.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on plate tectonics, earthquakes and volcanoes, always begin by reading the question carefully and noting command words such as ‘describe’, ‘explain’, ‘suggest’ or ‘evaluate’, because each requires a different style of response. For description questions give clear, factual detail about processes or features and use correct terminology such as ‘focus’, ‘epicentre’, ‘magnitude’, ‘subduction’ and ‘magma chamber’. For explanation questions make sure you link cause and effect; for example, explain how subduction leads to melting and the formation of-andesitic magma that causes explosive eruptions. Use case study evidence where appropriate: name the place, give key facts (date, magnitude or type of eruption, numbers affected) and relate these specifics to the general point you are making. When asked to assess impacts or management, separate social, economic and environmental effects and distinguish short-term emergency responses from long-term mitigation and planning. Diagrams and annotated sketches are often valuable; even a simple labelled cross-section of a subduction zone, a diagram of seismic wave propagation or a sketch of volcanic landforms can earn marks if they are clear and correctly labelled. In data- or resource-based questions interpret the supplied material carefully, refer directly to the resource, and use it to support your answer. Manage your time by allocating marks to the amount of detail required, and always finish with a concise concluding sentence for extended answers to show the examiner you have answered the question fully.
