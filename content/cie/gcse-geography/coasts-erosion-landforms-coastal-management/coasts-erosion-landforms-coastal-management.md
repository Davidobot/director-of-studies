# Coasts: erosion, landforms and coastal management (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## The coast as a dynamic zone
Coasts are where the land meets the sea and are shaped by the continuous interaction between marine, atmospheric and terrestrial processes. The most important forces are waves, tides and currents driven by wind and the Earth’s rotation, together with sea-level change over longer timescales. Coasts are dynamic: they change daily with the tides and seasonally with storms, and over decades or centuries through long-term trends such as rising sea level or changes in sediment supply. People value coasts for ports, tourism, industry, farming and nature, so understanding coastal processes helps explain why some stretches are eroding rapidly while others build outwards to form beaches, spits and bars.

## Coastal processes: erosion, transportation and deposition
Waves are the main agent of coastal change. Their power depends on wind strength, duration and fetch (the distance over which the wind blows). Constructive waves are low, long and carry material onto the shore, building beaches; destructive waves are high, steep and have strong backwash, removing material and causing erosion. There are four principal erosional processes: hydraulic action, where waves compress air in cracks and weaken rock; abrasion (or corrasion), where rock fragments hurled by waves grind away the cliff; attrition, where rock particles collide and become smaller and rounder; and solution (corrosion), where rock minerals are dissolved by seawater. Transportation moves sediment along the coast by processes such as longshore drift, which transfers material in a zigzag pattern driven by angled swash and straight backwash. Deposition occurs when wave energy falls, allowing material to settle and accumulate to form beaches, spits, tombolos and sand dunes. The balance between the amount of sediment delivered, reworked and taken away is described as the sediment budget; changes to this balance—due to dams, coastal defences or storms—affect whether a stretch of coast will erode or accrete.

## Coastal landforms produced by erosion
Cliffs and wave-cut platforms are common features where waves attack a rocky coastline. Waves erode a notch at the base of the cliff, which enlarges until the cliff above collapses, repeating the process and causing cliff retreat; the rock left at low tide forms a wave-cut platform. Headlands, bays, caves, arches, stacks and stumps follow a recognisable sequence where softer rock erodes faster to form bays, leaving harder rock protruding as headlands. Cracks in headlands enlarge to form caves, which can develop into arches; when an arch collapses the isolated pillar that remains is a stack, which eventually becomes a stump as it is worn away. The appearance and rate of formation of these features depend on rock type (more resistant rocks produce more dramatic features), joints and bedding planes, wave energy and tidal range. The classic example often taught in Cambridge courses is the stacks and arches along the Dorset coast (part of the Jurassic Coast), though similar sequences occur worldwide wherever alternating rock types meet the sea.

## Coastal landforms produced by deposition
Where wave energy is lower, transported material is deposited to create beaches, spits, bars and sand dunes. Beaches are accumulations of sand and shingle that vary in profile between beaches dominated by constructive waves (flat, wide, sandy) and those dominated by destructive waves (steeper, shingle). Longshore drift can build spits—narrow ridges of sand or shingle that extend from the coast into open water, often with a hooked end where the prevailing wind or tidal currents change direction. If a spit grows across a bay and connects to the headland opposite, a bar may form, creating a lagoon behind it. Tombolos develop where a spit or bar links an island to the mainland, as seen in places such as Chesil Beach in England where shingle forms a long, narrow ridge. Dunes form when winds blow sand inland from the beach, accumulating behind obstacles and later stabilised by vegetation; they are important natural buffers against the sea.

## Coastal ecosystems: coral reefs and mangroves
Coasts also support distinctive ecosystems that both depend on and protect the shoreline. Coral reefs develop in warm, shallow, clear waters and are built by colonies of corals that secrete calcium carbonate. Reefs create physical barriers that reduce wave energy and protect shorelines, while providing habitats for rich marine biodiversity and supporting tourism and fisheries. Mangrove swamps grow in sheltered tropical and subtropical coastlines where fine sediments accumulate; mangrove trees tolerate salty, waterlogged soils and their tangled roots trap sediment, slow water flow and stabilise the shoreline. Both coral reefs and mangroves provide natural coastal defence, but they are vulnerable to human impacts such as coastal development, pollution, overfishing and climate change. The protection they offer is now recognised in many sustainable coastal management plans, with restoration projects used increasingly in tropical regions to reduce erosion and increase resilience to storm surges.

## Coastal hazards and human opportunities
Coasts offer many opportunities: ports and trade, fertile estuarine soils, tourism, fishing and renewable energy such as offshore wind. However, they also present hazards. Coastal erosion can threaten homes and infrastructure, coastal flooding from storm surges and high tides can inundate low-lying areas, and tropical storms can cause widespread damage to both coastal settlements and ecosystems. Sea-level rise, driven by climate change, increases the frequency and severity of these hazards and can lead to coastal squeeze where habitats such as saltmarshes are trapped between rising water and built defences. Human activities interact with natural processes: building groynes or seawalls can stabilise one stretch of coast but starve downdrift areas of sediment, increasing erosion there. Understanding both the benefits and risks of coasts is essential for balanced decision-making and for protecting livelihoods and environments.

## Coastal management: options, approaches and trade-offs
Coastal management ranges from hard engineering that resists the sea to soft engineering and adaptive approaches that work with natural processes. Hard engineering includes sea walls, rock armour (riprap), groynes and revetments which offer immediate and visible protection but are often expensive and can have negative impacts on adjacent coastlines. Soft engineering techniques include beach nourishment—adding sand or shingle to replace lost sediment—and dune regeneration through planting and sand fencing; these approaches are often cheaper, more visually acceptable and more sustainable because they maintain natural processes. Managed realignment (or strategic retreat) allows selected low-value areas to flood or erode, creating new habitats and reducing long-term costs; Medmerry in southern England is a well-known example where a managed realignment scheme created wetlands while providing sustainable flood protection. Decision-making about management uses economic, social and environmental criteria: the value of protected land, the number of people affected, cultural importance, and ecological significance. National or local strategies may choose to “hold the line,” “advance the line” by creating new land, “managed realignment,” or “do nothing.” Each option has trade-offs and requires clear justification, monitoring and community engagement.

## Applying theory to case studies and classroom fieldwork
Exam questions often expect candidates to use case studies to illustrate ideas. Useful case studies for coastal topics include the rapidly eroding Holderness Coast in eastern England, where soft boulder clay cliffs, a long fetch from the North Sea and human interruption of sediment supply have produced high annual cliff retreat rates; the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, which demonstrates rock-type control on erosional features such as Durdle Door and Old Harry; and Medmerry for a managed realignment example. Internationally, the Netherlands shows large-scale engineering (dikes and the Delta Works) that protects low-lying land, while Bangladesh demonstrates how mangrove protection and community-based strategies can reduce storm impacts for vulnerable populations. Fieldwork is particularly valuable: simple enquiries such as measuring beach profiles, sampling pebble size to investigate sorting, timing wave frequency, or surveying land use and cliff condition can generate primary data for coursework or exam answers. When conducting fieldwork, candidates should follow the 'route to geographical enquiry': establish aims, design methods, collect data, present findings with graphs or maps, analyse results, and reach conclusions that evaluate reliability and suggest improvements.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on coasts, read the question carefully to identify command words such as ‘describe’, ‘explain’, ‘suggest’ or ‘evaluate’. Use precise geographical terms—hydraulic action, longshore drift, abrasion, constructive/destructive waves—because terminology scores marks. For description questions, focus on clear statements about features or processes and include specific detail such as how wave energy changes on the beach or the sequence from cave to stump. For explanation questions, link causes and effects explicitly: explain why soft rocks erode faster or how groynes affect sediment budgets updrift and downdrift. Where a case study is required, briefly outline the place, the problem or feature and give concrete data or examples (for instance, average cliff retreat rate, the type of management used and a named scheme). For higher-mark questions, structure answers with an introduction, developed paragraphs and a short conclusion that reaches a balanced judgement—especially for ‘to what extent’ or ‘evaluate’ tasks. Diagrams and simple annotated sketches can add clarity and earn marks; label them and refer to them in the text. Finally, manage your time: allow longer answers for questions with more marks, and use the mark allocation as a guide to how much detail is needed.
