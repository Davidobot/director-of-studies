# Coasts: erosion, deposition and coastal management (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## Overview of coastal systems and why coasts matter
Coasts are dynamic zones where land and sea meet and interact. They are shaped by waves, tides, currents and winds acting on the rocks and sediments of the shore. For people, coasts provide important opportunities — ports, tourism, fisheries, and fertile estuaries — but they also present hazards such as erosion, flooding and storm damage. Understanding coastal processes helps explain how striking landforms are created and why some places are more vulnerable than others. It also provides the basis for deciding how to manage coasts sustainably, balancing economic, social and environmental needs.

## Processes that shape the coast: waves, weathering, erosion, transport and deposition
The energy of the sea is transferred to the shore by waves. Waves develop in response to wind and their power depends on wind strength, how long the wind blows and the fetch — the distance over which the wind travels across the sea. Constructive waves are low, long and deposit material; destructive waves are steeper, higher and remove material. Weathering on cliffs and rock faces, including freeze–thaw, salt crystallisation and biological weathering, weakens rock so waves can act more effectively.

Erosion operates by several main processes. Hydraulic action forces air and water into cracks, weakening rock; abrasion (or corrasion) grinds rock fragments against the cliff; attrition wears particles into smaller, rounder pieces; and solution (corrosion) dissolves soluble minerals. Once sediment is eroded it is moved along the coast and offshore by transportation processes. Longshore drift carries sediment along the shore in the direction of the prevailing wind and wave approach; within the water, sediment moves by traction (rolling), saltation (bouncing), suspension (fine particles carried in water) and solution. Deposition occurs where the sea’s energy falls — for example in sheltered bays, behind headlands, or where waves slow at the mouth of an estuary — and leads to beaches, spits and dunes forming.

Sea-level change and human activity modify these natural processes. Relative sea-level rise increases the potential for flooding and erosion; coastal engineering and land-use changes (such as reclaiming land, building ports, or removing vegetation) alter sediment supply and wave energy at particular sites.

## Erosional landforms: cliffs, wave-cut platforms, caves, arches, stacks and stumps, bays and headlands
Where rock is exposed to high wave energy, the coast may retreat through erosion, producing characteristic landforms. Cliffs form where erosion at the base causes undercutting and collapse. Wave-cut platforms are the gently sloping rock benches left at the base of a retreating cliff, visible at low tide. Weaknesses and joints in headlands are exploited by hydraulic action and abrasion to form caves that can develop into arches when they break through. When roofs of arches collapse the isolated pillars left standing are called stacks; continued erosion reduces stacks to stumps.

The contrast between resistant and less resistant rock creates headlands and bays. Harder rock protrudes as headlands that receive the brunt of wave attack, while softer rock is eroded more quickly to form deeper bays. These sheltered bays are places where sediment is deposited and beaches often form. Many classic coastal landscapes show a sequence of these erosional features running along a stretch of coastline and are useful case studies for understanding process and time scale.

## Depositional landforms: beaches, spits, bars and sand dunes
Where waves lose energy, they deposit the sediment they carry and build depositional features. Beaches are accumulations of sand or pebbles shaped by the size and type of waves and the supply of sediment. On many coasts, longshore drift can transport sediment alongshore and create spits — linear ridges of sand or shingle that extend from the mainland into the sea or across the mouth of a bay. Spits may develop hooked ends if the prevailing wind changes. If a spit grows across a bay to join another headland, a bar may close off a bay to form a lagoon. Behind beaches and dunes, sediment trapped by vegetation or cross-winds can build coastal sand dunes; these are fragile ecosystems that can provide natural flood defence and habitat diversity.

Depositional landforms often respond quickly to changes in sediment supply and wave climate, so human activities upstream (for example dam building reducing river sediment) or along the coast (such as construction of groynes) can dramatically change their form.

## Coral reefs and mangrove swamps: conditions, features and value
Two important coastal ecosystems are coral reefs and mangrove swamps, both offering natural protection and supporting biodiversity. Coral reefs develop in warm, shallow, clear seas where sunlight penetrates; reef-building corals secrete calcium carbonate and over long periods create fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls. Reefs act as wave barriers, reducing wave energy before it reaches the shore, and they support fisheries and tourism. However, reefs are sensitive to temperature change, water quality and physical damage; coral bleaching from warming seas and sediment or nutrient pollution can severely reduce reef health.

Mangrove swamps occur in tropical and subtropical sheltered coastlines and estuaries where saline, muddy conditions prevail. Mangrove trees have specialised roots that trap sediment, stabilise shorelines and dissipate storm energy. Mangroves provide nursery grounds for fish, store carbon and protect coastal communities from storm surges. Both mangroves and reefs deliver ecosystem services that are increasingly valued in integrated coastal management.

## Coastal hazards, opportunities and the impacts of change
Coasts present opportunities such as fertile delta soils, ports that support trade, and scenic landscapes that drive tourism and local economies. At the same time they are exposed to hazards: coastal erosion can undermine buildings and infrastructure; storm surges and high tides can cause flooding; tsunamis and tropical cyclones produce sudden, catastrophic damage. Sea-level rise linked to climate change increases the frequency and severity of coastal flooding and accelerates shoreline retreat, especially where land is subsiding.

Human responses to coastal change can create winners and losers. For example, building a groyne to protect one stretch of beach may trap sediment there but starve the downdrift coast of material, worsening erosion elsewhere. Understanding both the physical processes and the social, economic and political context is essential for judging impacts and designing fair management approaches.

## Coastal management: options, trade-offs and examples
Coastal management ranges from hard engineering structures that resist the sea to soft, more sustainable approaches that work with natural processes. Hard engineering includes sea walls, rock armour (rip-rap), revetments, groynes and gabions. These are often effective locally and provide immediate protection, but they are expensive, can be visually intrusive and may transfer erosion problems elsewhere. Soft engineering includes beach nourishment, dune stabilisation and planting vegetation to trap sediment. Managed realignment or planned retreat allows certain low-value areas to flood or erode, creating new intertidal habitats and reducing the cost of maintaining highly engineered defences.

Medmerry on the south coast of England is a modern example of managed realignment where a large scheme allowed the sea to occupy low-lying land behind new defences, providing long-term flood protection and creating habitat. On parts of the Holderness coast in eastern England, communities such as Mappleton protect key assets with groynes and rock armour, but downdrift beaches and features such as Spurn Head have been affected by reduced sediment supply. In tropical contexts, conserving mangroves has been shown to reduce coastal damage from storms and cyclones while supporting fisheries and livelihoods. Effective coastal management requires an integrated approach that evaluates costs, benefits, environmental impacts and social equity over long time scales and often combines hard and soft measures.

## Fieldwork, map skills and linking theory to places
Understanding coasts is strengthened by fieldwork and map-based study. Field techniques include measuring beach profiles, pebble size and roundness, wave direction, and surveying longshore drift using tracer methods. On maps, coastal features appear as contour lines, cliff symbols, sand-shingle shading and estuary outlines; large-scale maps allow measurement of distances, bearings and cross-sections, while aerial photos and satellite images show patterns of erosion and deposition over time. In exams you will be expected to interpret such resources, describe spatial patterns, calculate rates (for example cliff retreat in metres per year) and use specific place-based case studies to illustrate points. Strong answers combine clear process explanation with precise, place-specific evidence, and where appropriate, simple quantified data from fieldwork or secondary sources.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on coasts, begin by reading the question carefully and noting command words such as "describe", "explain", "suggest" or "evaluate". For description tasks, give clear definitions and use the correct geographical terms (for example hydraulic action, abrasion, longshore drift). For explanation, link causes to effects in a sequence: state the process, explain how it works, and show how that process produces the landform or impact. Where diagrams help, sketch a simple labelled diagram of a process or landform and use it to support your writing. Always include a relevant case study or example to show place knowledge: name the location, describe what happened there, give figures if available (rates or dates) and explain why that example is appropriate.

In evaluation or judgement questions, set out advantages and disadvantages, consider environmental, economic and social criteria, and balance short-term against long-term outcomes. Use clear comparative language and finish with a justified conclusion that answers the question directly. For map- and resource-based questions, base all claims on evidence in the source: refer to specific features, quotes or values and explain what they show. Manage your time by using sub-mark allocations as a guide to how much detail is expected. Practise past-style questions, fieldwork write-ups and drawing quick, accurate diagrams; being fluent with key terms and one or two well-prepared local and global case studies (for example a UK managed realignment project and a tropical mangrove or reef example) will make your answers clear, convincing and exam-ready.
