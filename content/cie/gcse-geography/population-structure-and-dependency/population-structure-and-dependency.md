# Population structure and dependency (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## What we mean by population structure
Population structure describes how a population is made up by age and sex. It is the snapshot that shows how many children, working-age people and older people live in a place, and how many are male or female in each age group. Understanding population structure helps geographers and decision-makers see the current needs of a society and predict future problems or opportunities. For example, a country with many young people will need schools and jobs, while a country with many older people will need more healthcare and pensions. Population structure is not static: it changes over time because of birth rates, death rates and migration.

## Reading age–sex pyramids
The most common way to show population structure is an age–sex pyramid. The pyramid has males on the left and females on the right, with horizontal bars for age groups from youngest at the bottom to oldest at the top. The width of each bar shows the number or percentage of people in that age group. A wide base and narrow top is typical of a population with high birth rates and falling life expectancy; a narrower base and bulging middle shows a population with lower birth rates and expanding working-age cohorts; a top-heavy shape with a wide upper section indicates an ageing population. When you read a pyramid in an exam, comment on the shape, the relative sizes of young, working-age and elderly groups, and any noticeable differences between males and females. Note features such as sudden dips or bulges which may indicate past events like wars, baby booms or waves of migration.

## Typical types of population structure
Population pyramids are often described using three broad types. An expansive or youthful pyramid has a very wide base and indicates high fertility and a large proportion of children; many developing countries show this pattern. A stationary or stable pyramid has a more rectangular shape through the working ages, with a balanced base and top; it suggests low birth and death rates with steady population. A constrictive or ageing pyramid narrows at the base and widens higher up, showing low fertility and higher life expectancy; many developed countries display this pattern. These types are useful shorthand for answering questions, but remember real populations can show mixed features and are affected by migration and historic events.

## Causes of different population structures
Three main processes change population structure: fertility, mortality and migration. High fertility increases the proportion of children and lowers the median age, while declining fertility raises the proportion of working-age and older people over time. Improvements in health care, sanitation and nutrition reduce mortality and increase life expectancy, producing larger older cohorts. Migration can change the structure quickly: if many young adults migrate into a country, the working-age population will grow and the proportion of children and elderly may fall. Government policies also matter: family planning programmes, pro-natalist incentives (encouraging higher birth rates) or restrictive measures can influence fertility. Epidemics, wars and famines can leave visible scars on a pyramid by creating sudden falls in particular age groups.

## Dependency: definition and calculation
Dependency refers to the relationship between the economically dependent part of the population and the working-age population. The dependency ratio is a way to measure this pressure. It is calculated by adding the number of young dependents (commonly aged 0–14) and old dependents (commonly aged 65 and over), dividing this total by the number of people in the working ages (commonly aged 15–64), and multiplying by 100 to express the result as a percentage. For example, if a country has 40 million people aged 0–14 and 10 million aged 65+ (50 million dependents) and 100 million people aged 15–64, the dependency ratio is (50 ÷ 100) × 100 = 50%. This means there are 50 dependents for every 100 working-age people. You can also calculate youth and elderly dependency ratios separately to show whether pressure comes mainly from children or from older people. Understanding these ratios helps explain demands on services, taxation and the labour market.

## Impacts of high dependency and of different types of dependency
High youth dependency creates strong demand for schools, immunisation, child healthcare and eventually jobs for a large cohort entering the labour market. If the economy cannot provide employment, there may be high youth unemployment, underemployment and social unrest. Conversely, a high elderly dependency ratio increases demand for pensions, long-term healthcare, age-appropriate housing and social care. Public spending shifts from education and investment to welfare and health services, and governments may face rising taxation or budget deficits. High dependency can also affect families: in youthful societies parents may care for many children, while in ageing societies fewer workers support more retirees, sometimes leading to intergenerational tension. There are economic opportunities, too: a youthful population can produce a demographic dividend if investment in education and jobs turns a large cohort into productive workers, boosting growth. An ageing population can create demand for new industries, such as healthcare technology and leisure services for older adults.

## Responses and policies to manage dependency issues
Different countries use different policies depending on whether they face youth or elderly dependency. Countries with youthful populations often focus on family planning, education, health services and job creation to harness the potential demographic dividend. Investment in girls’ education, reproductive health services and creating a business environment that supports entrepreneurship are common strategies. Countries with ageing populations may encourage higher fertility through incentives such as child benefits and parental leave, or they may increase the retirement age, reform pensions and promote active ageing. Another common response is selective migration policy: countries with labour shortages may allow more young migrants to enter to boost the working-age population. Long-term planning for both scenarios involves redesigning public services, adapting housing and transport, and preparing the economy for structural changes in the labour force.

## Examples to illustrate structure and dependency
Consider two contrasting contemporary examples. A country with a very young structure, such as many sub-Saharan African states, typically shows a broad pyramid base where children and teenagers form a large proportion of the population. These countries often have high youth dependency ratios and face challenges in providing sufficient schools and jobs. Rapid population growth places pressure on land and resources but can offer a demographic dividend if governments invest in human capital and create employment. In contrast, Japan exemplifies an ageing population with a narrow base and wide upper sections on the pyramid. Japan has one of the highest elderly dependency ratios in the world, which contributes to a shrinking workforce, rising healthcare and pension costs, and innovative policy responses such as raising the pension age, using technology and robots in eldercare, and cautiously opening labour markets to selected migrants. When you answer exam questions, use these kinds of clear, named examples to show your understanding of structure and dependency in practice.

## Exam technique
When you tackle questions on population structure and dependency, begin by identifying exactly what the question asks: define key terms if the question requires it and be precise with ages and concepts when asked to calculate or explain. If an age–sex pyramid or a table is provided, spend the first minute describing its main features in clear sentences, noting the shape, the proportions of young/working-age/old groups and any anomalies. For calculation questions, show your working for the dependency ratio and give the result as a percentage, then interpret what that percentage means in practical terms. Use case study evidence where required: briefly name the country, give the relevant pyramid feature or dependency ratio, and connect this to concrete consequences such as school demand, healthcare costs, or migration patterns. When asked to suggest solutions or evaluate policies, weigh short-term and long-term effects and consider economic, social and political constraints. Always link your answers back to the key geographical ideas of scale and change through time, and remember that examiners reward clear explanation supported by specific examples and numerical evidence where appropriate.
