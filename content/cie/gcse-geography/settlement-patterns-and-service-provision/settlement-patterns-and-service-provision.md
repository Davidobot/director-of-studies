# Settlement patterns and service provision (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## What settlement patterns are and why they matter
Settlements are places where people live and work, ranging from a single isolated farm to vast cities. Settlement patterns describe the arrangement of these places across the landscape and the relationships between them. Understanding patterns and service provision helps explain why people choose to live where they do, how settlements grow and change over time, and how goods and services are organised to meet people’s needs. In human geography, looking at settlement patterns connects physical factors such as relief and water supply with human factors such as transport, land use, economic activities and historical development. This combination of factors shapes the hierarchy of settlements, the kinds of services available, and the area each settlement serves.

## Rural settlement patterns: dispersed, nucleated and linear
Rural settlements commonly follow one of three patterns: dispersed, nucleated or linear. Dispersed settlements are made up of isolated farms and houses scattered across the countryside; this pattern is typical where land is used for extensive agriculture, where field systems and ownership encourage farmsteads to be separated, or where relief makes clustered building difficult. Examples include parts of the American Midwest and upland areas of Britain where individual farmsteads lie far apart. Nucleated settlements are compact villages or towns with houses clustered around a focal point such as a green, crossroads or market place. This pattern develops where fertile soils and communal strip fields encourage villagers to live close together, and where markets or churches become local centres; many traditional English and European villages are nucleated. Linear settlements occur along physical or human transport corridors—along roads, rivers, canals or coastal strips. These develop where movement and access are more important than centralised communal land, such as settlements lining a valley floor or a coastal road. Recognising these patterns on maps and in the field tells you about past land use, transport routes and the economic activities that sustained the settlement.

## Site, situation and factors influencing location and growth
The site of a settlement refers to the physical place where it stands, while the situation describes its wider location in relation to other places and resources. Physical site factors that have historically influenced settlement include access to fresh water from rivers or springs, fertile soils for agriculture, shelter from prevailing winds offered by valleys or hilltops, and locally available building materials such as stone or timber. Human and economic factors are equally important: accessibility by road, rail or river, proximity to markets and raw materials, and political or defensive advantages have all directed where settlements form or expand. For example, towns often grew at river crossings or road junctions because these places concentrate trade and movement. Over time the growth of a settlement can be driven by industrial development, transport improvements such as railways and highways, administrative or religious status, or government policies that encourage housing and business development. Equally, settlements can decline if transport routes bypass them or if economic activity moves elsewhere.

## Settlement functions and the hierarchy of services
Every settlement performs functions: some places are primarily residential, some provide services and shops, and others act as centres for industry, administration or education. The pattern of services within and between settlements can be understood through the idea of hierarchy. At the lowest level are small settlements (hamlets and small villages) offering low-order services such as a post box, a local shop or a primary school. At the top are large cities providing high-order services that require large populations to support them, such as specialist hospitals, universities, major department stores and airports. Two key concepts help explain why services are distributed in this way. The threshold is the minimum number of people required to support a service; a small village cannot support a supermarket because the population is too small to provide enough customers. The range is the maximum distance people are willing to travel to use a service; high-order services have large ranges because people will travel further for specialist goods or treatment. The sphere of influence of a settlement is the area from which it draws customers and users for its services; market towns have larger spheres of influence than villages. Central place theory, developed as a model for the regular spacing and hierarchical arrangement of settlements, is useful as an idealised explanation: larger central places offer more and rarer services and are farther apart, while smaller places are more numerous and closer together.

## Urban land use, functions and change
In urban areas the distribution of services and activities follows patterns shaped by history, transport and economic change. The Central Business District (CBD) concentrates shops, offices and high-order services because it is highly accessible and offers prestige. Surrounding the CBD are zones of mixed land use, inner-city residential areas, industrial estates and later suburban residential neighbourhoods. The rural–urban fringe at the edge of a city often contains large stores, business parks, new housing estates and recreational facilities; this zone grows rapidly where land is available and transport links are good. Urban growth leads to changes in land use as older industrial areas are redeveloped into housing or commercial spaces, and as suburbanisation expands the city footprint. Problems such as urban sprawl, traffic congestion and conflicts over land use arise when growth is rapid or poorly planned. Understanding urban morphology, the spatial distribution of functions and how people access services is central to explaining the role of towns and cities in the settlement hierarchy.

## How services are provided and the challenges of access
Service provision can be public or private and varies with economic development, population density and transport infrastructure. In densely populated urban areas a wide range of services is concentrated, often available within short distances. In remote or sparsely populated rural areas services may be few, and residents may travel long distances to reach supermarkets, secondary schools, hospitals or government offices. This creates what are sometimes called service deserts—areas where essential services are difficult to access. Modern telecommunications and online services have altered this picture by providing banking, shopping and information remotely, but physical services such as hospitals and schools still require people to travel. Inequalities in service provision are influenced by wealth, governance, and investment. Local authorities and private firms make decisions about where to locate services based on potential customers, transport costs and planning rules, while national or regional facilities emerge where populations, economies or strategic considerations justify them. Planners must balance the cost of providing services with fairness of access, often using policies such as mobile clinics, subsidised rural transport or incentives for businesses to open in underserved areas.

## Case study: a market city and its rural hinterland — Cambridge and surrounding villages
Cambridge in eastern England provides a clear example of settlement hierarchy and service provision. As a historic university city with high-order services, Cambridge offers specialist education, hospitals, research institutions, and an international transport link nearby. Its Central Business District contains shops and services that draw people from the city and surrounding towns. Smaller market towns and villages in the surrounding rural area rely on Cambridge for high-order services they cannot sustain, such as specialist healthcare, higher education and large retail centres. Villages retain local services of low order—primary schools, a post office or a convenience shop—and have limited thresholds that restrict service variety. The city’s transport links, including roads and rail connections, enlarge its sphere of influence and encourage commuting. Over time Cambridge has expanded through suburban development and the growth of technology clusters in the fringe and business parks, changing land use from agricultural to residential and commercial. Planning policies and green belts influence where development occurs, and local debates often centre on balancing growth with protection of the rural environment. This local example demonstrates how site and situation, transport, economic functions and planning decisions interact to produce a hierarchy of settlements and a pattern of service provision across a landscape.

## Teaching and fieldwork ideas to explore patterns and services
Studying settlement patterns is best supported by practical work that links maps, observations and data. Fieldwork in a local town can include mapping land use and identifying service types and distribution, carrying out pedestrian counts to estimate activity in the CBD at different times of day, or surveying residents to discover where they go for particular services and why. Sketch maps and annotated photographs help students to describe nucleated, linear or dispersed forms, while OS large-scale maps or aerial images allow measurement of distances to compare spheres of influence. In class, comparing contrasting rural settlements or investigating how a nearby town fits central place theory gives practice in applying concepts such as threshold and range. When looking at service provision, students should be encouraged to consider access issues: who can reach which services, how transport links affect choices, and what solutions might improve equality of provision, such as mobile services, online alternatives or transport subsidies. Linking these activities to a named case study ensures that answers in examinations are vividly illustrated and grounded in real examples.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on settlement patterns and service provision, begin by defining key terms such as settlement pattern, threshold, range and sphere of influence, and make sure your answer addresses the command word of the question. For a describe question, give clear, factual description illustrated by named examples. For an explain question, link causes to effects: show how physical site factors or transport accessibility lead to particular settlement forms and service distributions. When a question asks you to use a case study, keep the case study focused and relevant: give specific details (name, location, main services, population size or role) and use them to support your explanations. In map-based questions use compass directions, distances and recognizable features from the map to support your points, and in resource-based tasks extract the key facts from the provided material rather than relying on outside knowledge. For longer evaluative questions, balance positive and negative aspects, use geographical terminology, and conclude with a clear judgement that follows from your evidence. Always check the marks available and shape the length of your answer accordingly, ensuring you include both knowledge and analysis, and where appropriate, a short, supported conclusion.
