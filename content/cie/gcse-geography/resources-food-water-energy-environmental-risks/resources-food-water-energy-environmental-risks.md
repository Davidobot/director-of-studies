# Resources: food, water, energy and environmental risks (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## Overview: why resources matter and how geographers study them
Resources — food, water and energy — are the foundations of human life and economic activity. Geography looks at where these resources come from, how they are used, who controls them and the environmental consequences of extracting, producing and consuming them. At GCSE level you will be expected to understand the inputs, processes and outputs of agricultural and industrial systems, to explain why shortages or surpluses occur, and to assess options for sustainable management. You will also need to connect local examples to national and global patterns: for instance, how drought in one region can influence food prices worldwide, or how a country’s energy mix affects its greenhouse gas emissions. Always think in terms of opportunities and hazards, and remember that every resource question has social, economic and physical dimensions.

## Food production: systems, problems and sustainable solutions
Agricultural systems can be described in terms of inputs (land, labour, capital, seed, fertiliser, water), processes (ploughing, planting, irrigation, pest control, harvesting) and outputs (crops, livestock products, waste). Farming types range from subsistence systems, where families grow food mainly for themselves, to commercial, high-input systems that feed markets. Factors such as climate, soil, relief and market access determine what type of farming is possible and profitable in a place.

Food shortages arise from natural causes such as droughts, floods, pest outbreaks and tropical storms, and from human causes including conflict, poor infrastructure, low investment and inequitable distribution. The Ethiopian famines of the 1980s and recurring food crises in parts of the Sahel are examples where drought, weak governance and poverty combined to produce severe shortages. More recently, conflict and trade disruptions have shown how fragile global food systems can be.

Solutions to food shortages can be technological, managerial and social. Improvements include irrigation (drip irrigation to reduce water use and salinisation), improved seed varieties (including those from the Green Revolution), mechanisation, better storage and transport to reduce post-harvest losses, and social measures such as food aid and safety nets. Sustainable approaches emphasise agroecological methods: crop rotation, agroforestry, integrated pest management and conservation agriculture that protect soil and biodiversity while increasing resilience. In examination answers, link each problem to one or more concrete measures and evaluate trade-offs — for example, high-yield varieties can increase output but may require more water and fertilisers, which can harm the environment if unmanaged.

## Water supply: distribution, scarcity and management techniques
Water is used for agriculture, industry and domestic purposes, but the proportions vary greatly. Globally, agriculture accounts for around two-thirds to three-quarters of freshwater withdrawals, especially in irrigated farming regions, while domestic and industrial uses dominate in many industrialised countries. Water shortages emerge where demand outstrips supply or where the supply is unreliable, polluted or poorly distributed. Causes include climate variability (droughts), over-abstraction of groundwater, contamination of rivers and aquifers, and inadequate infrastructure.

Management responses can be hardware-based — reservoirs, dams, boreholes, desalination plants — and software-based — water pricing, allocation rules, demand reduction and public education. Israel’s widespread use of drip irrigation, combined with extensive desalination and water recycling (treated wastewater), shows how technology and policy can secure supplies in an arid setting. Singapore’s reclaimed water programme is another model of urban supply innovation. However, large dams and reservoirs have social and ecological costs: displacement of people, loss of habitats and changes to downstream flow regimes. Desalination provides reliable water but is energy intensive and costly, and can have marine environmental impacts. Sustainable water management therefore often combines supply measures with demand reduction (leak reduction, efficient irrigation), protection of watersheds through reforestation and pollution control, and integrated water resources management that balances competing needs.

When answering exam questions, be ready to describe specific methods (how a dam or desalination plant works), to weigh benefits and disadvantages, and to discuss equity: who gains access to improved water supplies and who bears the costs.

## Energy: sources, choices and the transition to sustainability
Energy resources include non-renewable fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), renewables (wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, tidal), nuclear power and traditional biomass such as fuelwood. Countries differ in their energy mixes. Oil-rich states often rely heavily on fossil fuels for domestic consumption and export revenue, whereas countries like Norway combine hydropower with oil revenues, and Iceland uses abundant geothermal and hydro resources for heating and electricity.

Non-renewable fuels have powered industrial development but produce greenhouse gases and local pollution. Renewable energy sources generally produce less carbon and can be decentralised, increasing resilience, though they come with their own constraints: intermittency of wind and solar, high initial capital costs, and environmental impacts of large dams or biofuel plantations. Nuclear power provides large-scale low-carbon electricity but raises issues of radioactive waste, safety and high decommissioning costs; accidents such as Chernobyl and Fukushima are salient examples used in essays to weigh risks.

Geographers evaluate energy choices by considering energy security (reliable supply), affordability, environmental impacts and social acceptance. The transition to sustainable energy mixes involves improving energy efficiency, investing in renewables, and planning grids that can handle variable supply. Small-scale examples such as off-grid solar in rural Africa illustrate how renewables can provide rapid access to electricity where centralized grids are absent.

## Environmental risks of economic development: causes and consequences
Economic development often brings environmental risks. Agriculture can cause soil erosion, salinisation and desertification if land is overcultivated or irrigation is mismanaged. Industry releases pollutants into water and air, and mining can create acid mine drainage and landscape scars. Deforestation for agriculture or logging reduces biodiversity and contributes to enhanced global warming by releasing stored carbon. Urbanisation increases impermeable surfaces and flood risk, and industrial zones can create local air and water pollution with health consequences.

Illustrative examples help make answers concrete: the shrinking of the Aral Sea illustrates how large-scale irrigation can devastate ecosystems and local economies; oil pollution and gas flaring in the Niger Delta highlight how resource extraction can harm local communities; peatland drainage and palm oil expansion in Indonesia show how agricultural expansion can both drive emissions and create fire and haze hazards. Environmental management requires both technological fixes and governance: pollution control laws, protected areas, reforestation, sustainable land-use planning, cleaner production techniques, and economic policies such as payment for ecosystem services. Sustainable development seeks to reconcile economic needs with environmental protection by using resources efficiently, ensuring equitable access and maintaining ecosystem services for future generations.

In your answers, differentiate between localised impacts (e.g., health effects from factory pollution) and global impacts (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), and consider who bears the costs and who benefits from development.

## Using case studies effectively in exams
Cambridge IGCSE Geography requires case studies for Topic 3: you should have a farm or agricultural system case study, a country or region that has experienced food shortages, an energy supply example for a country or area, a water supply case, and a place where economic development is threatening the environment. Choose case studies you can write about with confidence and which illustrate both opportunities and hazards.

A good case study is specific: name the place, describe the physical and human context, explain the processes, give evidence (figures, dates, outcomes) and evaluate management responses. For example, if you use Israel as a water case study, explain the arid climate, the technologies used (drip irrigation, desalination, wastewater reuse), quantify outcomes where possible (e.g., increased irrigated area, reduced water loss), and evaluate social and environmental costs. For food shortages, a case such as the 2011 Horn of Africa drought or recent food insecurity in Yemen allows you to link climate, conflict and market disruption.

Do not rely on generalities. Where a question invites you to use your case study, tailor the details to the question rather than repeating a full description. If the paper provides resources, use them first — the resource contains all the place-specific information you need — but enrich your answer by bringing in a concise case study example to support an evaluation or conclusion.

## Exam technique
Answer the command words carefully: explain requires reasons and links between causes and effects; describe asks for characteristics and features; evaluate and assess expect balanced judgements weighing advantages and disadvantages. When a question asks for examples or case studies, be specific: name a place, give a brief context, and link it directly to the point you are making. Structure longer answers with a clear introduction, development of points with evidence, and a concluding sentence that directly answers the question or weighs the extent of agreement if the phrasing is evaluative.

Use data and diagrams where possible to support claims and reference figures or trends from the resources provided. Manage time by noting the marks available and allocating time proportionally; use sub-mark allocations on the paper to guide the depth of response. For map and skills questions, practise interpreting graphs, calculating averages and percentages, and using grid references and bearings so these tasks are routine in the exam. In extended responses, include both physical and human factors and make a judgement about sustainability or likely outcomes. Finally, practise past questions using your chosen case studies so that when an exam question asks for an example you can deploy concise, relevant evidence without wasting time.
