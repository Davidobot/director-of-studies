# Resource management: food, water, energy and environmental risks (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## Introduction
Resource management is about how people obtain, use and protect the materials and services that sustain life and economies: food, water and energy. These resources are unevenly distributed around the world and their availability is shaped by physical factors such as climate and soil, and by human decisions about technology, investment and policy. At GCSE level you will need to understand agricultural and industrial systems in terms of inputs, processes and outputs, to explain why shortages occur, and to evaluate the social and environmental consequences of different ways of meeting demand. Thinking in terms of opportunities and hazards, and appreciating the need for sustainable management, helps connect local examples to global patterns and to the assessment objectives of the syllabus.

## Food production and food security
A useful way to study food production is to think of an agricultural system as having inputs (land, climate, labour, seed, fertiliser, capital and machinery), processes (ploughing, planting, irrigation, pest control, harvesting and storage) and outputs (food, by-products and waste). Farming ranges from subsistence systems where families grow most of what they eat, to large-scale commercial agriculture producing food for distant markets. Arable, pastoral and mixed types, and intensive versus extensive systems, all have different resource needs and impacts. Productivity is affected by natural factors such as rainfall and soil fertility and by human factors such as access to credit, markets and technology. The Green Revolution illustrates how high-yielding varieties, irrigation and agrochemicals increased cereal production in parts of Asia and Latin America from the 1960s onwards; it raised output dramatically but also introduced new dependencies on fertilisers and irrigation, and widened inequalities between farmers who could afford modern inputs and those who could not.

Food security means having reliable access to enough safe and nutritious food to meet dietary needs. It is not only about production: distribution, storage, political stability and household income are equally important. Globalisation and transnational corporations have linked food supply chains across continents, so a poor harvest in one region can affect prices worldwide. At the same time, local food systems and smallholder agriculture remain crucial for many communities, and sustainable approaches that protect soil and biodiversity while increasing yields are central to long-term food security.

## Causes of food shortages and solutions
Food shortages arise from a mix of physical and human causes. Natural hazards such as droughts, floods, pests and plant diseases can reduce harvests rapidly; climatic extremes linked to climate change increase the frequency and severity of these events. Human causes include conflict that disrupts farming and supply routes, poor infrastructure that prevents food from reaching markets, low investment in agriculture, and economic factors that make inputs unaffordable for small-scale farmers. Poor storage and transport can mean large post-harvest losses, particularly in warm climates where pests and spoilage are common.

Solutions must therefore be multi-faceted. Short-term responses include emergency food aid and cash transfers, while medium- and long-term strategies focus on improving resilience: better crop varieties, diversified diets and crops, investment in irrigation and soil management, improved storage and transport, and strengthening local markets and land rights. Sustainable intensification aims to increase yields on existing farmland while reducing environmental harm, for example through precision agriculture that applies water and fertiliser only where needed, or agroecological methods that build soil fertility and biodiversity. Where appropriate, technology such as mobile phones can link farmers to market information and weather forecasts, reducing risk and improving incomes.

## Water resources: supply, shortages and management
Water is vital for drinking, sanitation, agriculture and industry. Methods of supply vary with local conditions: surface water stored in reservoirs behind dams, groundwater tapped by wells and boreholes, desalination of seawater in arid coastal states, and rainwater harvesting in both rural and urban contexts. The proportions of water used for agriculture, domestic and industrial purposes change with development: in many low-income countries agriculture dominates water use, whereas in highly industrialised economies industry and services take a larger share.

Water shortages may result from physical scarcity where rainfall is low or highly seasonal, from over-abstraction of aquifers, from pollution that makes water unsafe, or from inequality of access within a country. The health impacts of lacking clean water and sanitation are severe, contributing to waterborne disease and reducing the potential for economic development. Management strategies therefore include demand-side measures such as metering, tariff structures and efficiency improvements; supply-side measures including new reservoirs, desalination and wastewater recycling; and institutional approaches such as integrated water resources management that considers whole river basins, cross-sectoral needs and stakeholder rights. Large infrastructure projects such as major dams can provide reliable water and hydroelectricity but they also have social and environmental costs: displacement of people, changes to river ecosystems and sedimentation issues. Small-scale, locally appropriate solutions like boreholes, community-managed wells and low-cost filtration often play a crucial role in improving access in poorer areas.

## Energy: sources, choices and impacts
Energy underpins modern economies and daily life. Non-renewable fossil fuels—coal, oil and natural gas—have been dominant for more than a century because they are energy-dense and, in many contexts, economically accessible. However, their combustion releases greenhouse gases and local air pollutants, and reserves are finite and unevenly distributed. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal and modern bioenergy offer low-carbon alternatives, but they also have limitations: intermittency for wind and solar, environmental and social impacts for large hydroelectric schemes, and land-use or biodiversity concerns for some biofuels.

Nuclear power provides a low-carbon, high-output option but raises issues of radioactive waste, high capital costs and public perceptions shaped by accidents such as Chernobyl and Fukushima. The choice of energy mix for any country depends on availability of resources, cost, security of supply and environmental priorities. Energy security is not only about domestic production; it also depends on imports, infrastructure such as pipelines and grids, and political relationships. The transition to low-carbon energy involves not just building new generation capacity but also upgrading grid systems, developing storage technologies like batteries and pumped hydro, improving energy efficiency across industry and buildings, and managing social change where fossil-fuel jobs decline.

## Environmental risks of economic development
Economic activity brings benefits but also creates environmental risks at local and global scales. Soil erosion from inappropriate farming methods reduces productivity and can lead to sedimentation of rivers and reservoirs. Deforestation for agriculture or logging destroys habitats, reduces biodiversity and alters local climates; widespread clearing in tropical regions also contributes to global carbon emissions. Urban and industrial development can lead to pollution of air and water, noise and visual intrusion, and the contamination of soils and groundwater. Enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations from burning fossil fuels are linked to global warming and changes in climate patterns, which in turn amplify hazards such as storms and droughts.

Managing these risks requires a combination of regulation, planning and practical techniques. Environmental impact assessments are used to predict and reduce negative consequences of major projects. Pollution control through cleaner technologies, emissions standards, and waste management reduces local hazards. Conservation measures, protected areas and reforestation projects can protect ecosystems and provide long-term services such as flood regulation and carbon sequestration. The concept of the circular economy—designing products and systems to minimise waste and reuse resources—offers a framework for reducing environmental pressure while maintaining economic activity.

## Integrated approaches and sustainable management
At the heart of effective resource management is the idea of sustainable development: meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. Real-world resource management often requires integrated thinking across the water–energy–food nexus because actions in one area affect the others. For example, expanding irrigation for higher food production increases water demand and may raise energy use for pumping; constructing large hydropower dams may provide energy but change river flows important for fisheries and agriculture. Policy choices therefore need to balance trade-offs and seek synergies, supported by good data, community participation and adaptive governance.

International cooperation is important where resources cross borders or where global problems such as climate change require shared action. Technology transfer, fair trade arrangements and development finance can help lower-income countries adopt cleaner technologies and strengthen local food systems. Education and capacity building at local levels enable communities to manage common-pool resources such as groundwater or grazing land effectively. In short, sustainable resource management combines technical solutions, institutional arrangements and social change.

## Using case studies effectively
Case studies are central to exam answers and coursework because they turn abstract ideas into concrete evidence. A strong case study clearly states the location and scale, sets out the key facts and statistics, explains causes and impacts, and evaluates the success of responses. For a farm or agricultural system case study, describe inputs and outputs, show how local conditions influence choices (for example, irrigation in arid zones or terrace farming on slopes), and evaluate sustainability. For a country suffering food shortages, explain the combination of physical hazards and human factors such as conflict or poor infrastructure, and assess relief and long-term strategies. For water and energy studies, include details of supply methods (reservoir, desalination, renewable installations), any environmental or social impacts, and the effectiveness of management. Always use numbers where possible—percentages, yields, capacity, or dates—to make your answers precise, and conclude by weighing the positive and negative outcomes to show judgement.

## Exam technique
Answering questions effectively means matching your response to the command word, using knowledge and clear examples, and structuring answers so examiners can see your reasoning. For ‘describe’ and ‘explain’ questions start with a clear definition or overview, then develop points with reasons and evidence. For questions that ask you to ‘evaluate’, always include a balanced judgement: weigh advantages and disadvantages and finish with a reasoned conclusion that refers back to the question. Use your case studies proactively: introduce the example early, use specific facts to support each point, and link back to the required theme (food, water, energy or environmental risk). In map- or data-based questions apply geographical skills: interpret trends, refer to axes or units, and make comparisons where relevant. Manage your time so you can plan, write and check your answers; pay attention to the marks available as they indicate the depth expected. For coursework or alternative tasks follow the route to geographical enquiry—state aims and hypotheses, describe methods, present and analyse data, and evaluate reliability—making sure your conclusions are grounded in the evidence you collected. Clear, concise writing that shows understanding, analysis and judgement will meet the assessment objectives and earn higher marks.
