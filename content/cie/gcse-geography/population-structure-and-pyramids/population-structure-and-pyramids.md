# Population structure and pyramids (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## What population structure means
Population structure describes the make-up of a population by age and sex. It shows how many people fall into broad age groups such as children, working‑age adults and older people, and whether there are roughly equal numbers of males and females. Understanding population structure helps geographers and decision makers plan services such as schools, hospitals, housing and pensions, and it helps explain patterns of economic growth, migration and social change. A single population’s structure is not static; it changes over time because of births, deaths and migration, so reading a population structure is a way of seeing both the history and likely future needs of a place.

## How population pyramids are constructed
A population pyramid is a simple graphical way to show population structure. The horizontal axis shows population numbers or percentages, with males on the left and females on the right; the vertical axis shows age groups arranged in equal bands, usually five‑year cohorts (0–4, 5–9, 10–14, and so on). Each bar’s length represents how many people are in that age‑sex group. Pyramids can be drawn using absolute numbers (for example, thousands of people) or using percentages of the total population so that different countries can be compared. When you are given a pyramid in an exam, always note whether it uses numbers or percentages and read the axis carefully before commenting on the shape.

## Common pyramid shapes and what they tell us
There are three idealised shapes that help you interpret pyramids. An "expansive" pyramid has a very wide base and narrows quickly towards the top: this indicates a high proportion of children and a high birth rate, common in many low‑income countries with high fertility and declining but still significant mortality. A "constrictive" pyramid has a narrower base and a relatively larger proportion of older age groups: this shows low birth rates and an ageing population, typical in many high‑income countries with falling fertility and low mortality. A "stationary" pyramid looks more rectangular, with similar widths across the working‑age groups and a moderate elderly population; this indicates low birth and death rates and relatively stable population size. Real population pyramids often combine features, for example showing bulges from past baby booms or indentations where mortality events, wars or migration reduced specific age groups.

## Causes of different population structures
The shape of a pyramid is produced by three main demographic processes: fertility, mortality and migration. High fertility produces a broad base; falling fertility narrows the base over time. Improvements in health care, sanitation and nutrition reduce child and adult mortality and so widen the middle and upper parts of the pyramid as more people survive into older age. Migration can also change the shape: large numbers of young working‑age migrants will create a bulge in the middle of the pyramid and may create an imbalance between the number of men and women if migration is gendered. Government policies, cultural norms about family size, economic opportunities, education—especially female education—and public health crises such as epidemics all influence fertility and mortality and therefore the pyramid’s appearance.

## Social and economic implications of different structures
Population structure has direct consequences for services, the economy and long‑term planning. A young population with a high proportion of dependents aged 0–14 requires large investments in primary education, immunisation, childcare and eventually jobs for a rapidly growing workforce; if jobs are not available, high youth unemployment and migration pressures can result. A country with a high dependent elderly population needs greater health and social care provision, pension funding and age‑friendly housing; it may face labour shortages and slower economic growth unless productivity rises or migration fills gaps. The working‑age group, usually taken as ages 15–64, bears the dependency burden. You can quantify this by calculating the dependency ratio, expressed as ((young dependents + elderly dependents) ÷ working‑age population) × 100. For example, if children make up 40% of the population, elderly 5% and the working‑age population 55%, the dependency ratio is (40 + 5) ÷ 55 × 100 ≈ 81.8, which shows there are roughly 82 dependents for every 100 working‑age people. High dependency ratios strain public finances and household incomes; low dependency ratios can create a "demographic dividend" if the working‑age majority is productively employed, but this potential must be realised by investment in education, infrastructure and jobs.

## Interpreting specific features and anomalies
When you read a pyramid, look for bulges, indentations and asymmetries and explain their likely causes. A bulge in the cohorts aged 30–40 may reflect a past baby boom; a dent in cohorts aged 20–24 might indicate a period of lower births during an economic recession or major upheaval. A deficit of young adult males compared with females can indicate past conflict or male out‑migration for work. Wide top sections and a narrowing base in a high‑income country are often the result of long‑term low fertility combined with rising life expectancy. Sudden spikes or sharp troughs in specific age bands can also be caused by disasters, mass migration, or specific government policies such as pronatalist or antinatalist measures.

## Using pyramids in case studies and fieldwork
Pyramids are powerful evidence in case studies. For a country with a high dependent population—often required by the syllabus—use a current example such as Niger or Uganda to show an expansive pyramid with a very wide base, and explain the challenges for schools, maternal health services and future employment. For an ageing population, refer to Japan or Italy and describe pressures on pensions, healthcare and the need for labour replacement through automation or migration. When using pyramids from fieldwork or secondary data, always describe the data source and date, because population structure changes over time. Comparing two pyramids for the same country at different dates is an effective way to show demographic change, for instance demonstrating how fertility decline after improved female education and access to contraception narrows the base over decades.

## Exam technique
In exams, start by stating clearly what the pyramid shows: note whether the axes use numbers or percentages, give the date of the data if provided, and describe the overall shape in simple terms (expansive, constrictive or stationary). Then support your description with specific features such as the width of the 0–4 and 5–9 age groups, any bulges in working‑age cohorts and any imbalances between males and females. Explain causes by linking observed features to fertility, mortality and migration, and refer to relevant social or policy factors where appropriate. Move on to implications: consider short‑term needs such as schools or healthcare and longer‑term effects such as pension costs or the potential for a demographic dividend. If asked to compare two pyramids, use comparative language (wider, narrower, higher proportion) and give evidence from the chart, then explain why the differences exist. When a question asks you to evaluate or suggest solutions, bring in judgement by weighing short‑ and long‑term options and considering economic, social and political feasibility. Keep answers focused on the pyramid evidence and avoid making unsupported claims about a country; instead, say "this pattern could result from…" or "this is likely because…". Use the command words carefully: "describe" requires clear observation, "explain" requires causes and links, and "suggest" or "evaluate" asks for reasoned judgement. Practice writing short paragraphs that move from observation to explanation to implication, and practise calculating and interpreting the dependency ratio so you can add quantitative support to your answers when appropriate.
