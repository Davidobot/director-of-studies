# Economic development, globalisation and economic sectors (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## What is economic development and how is it measured?

Economic development describes the processes by which countries improve the economic, social and environmental well‑being of their people. It is not the same as simple economic growth, which measures increases in output or income; development also includes improvements in health, education and living standards. To assess development, geographers use a range of indicators. Economic indicators such as gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP) per capita give a sense of average income. Social indicators such as literacy rates, school enrolment, life expectancy and access to healthcare show human development, while composite indices such as the Human Development Index (HDI) combine income, education and life expectancy into a single score. Each indicator has strengths and limits: GNP per capita can hide large inequalities, while HDI smooths many differences between regions within a country. For exam answers you should be able to explain what each indicator measures, why it matters, and how different indicators together give a fuller picture of a country’s level of development. Always remember to give examples: for instance, an oil‑rich country might have a high GNP per capita but low life expectancy if wealth is unevenly distributed and public services are weak.

## Economic sectors and how they change with development

The economy is conventionally divided into four sectors: primary (extracting raw materials such as farming, fishing and mining), secondary (manufacturing and processing), tertiary (services such as retail, education and finance) and quaternary (knowledge‑based activities such as research, information technology and consultancy). As countries develop, employment typically shifts from the primary towards the secondary and then tertiary/quaternary sectors. In many low‑income countries a large proportion of people still work in agriculture, often in subsistence farming. Industrialisation brings growth in factory and processing jobs, as seen historically in northern England or more recently in parts of China and South Korea. In more advanced economies, the service and quaternary sectors dominate employment and output; examples include banking and high‑tech research in London, New York or Seoul. These shifts are driven by mechanisation, urbanisation, improvements in education and changing consumer demand. When answering examination questions, explain the causes of changes in sectoral employment and use examples to show the social and environmental consequences, such as rural depopulation, urban job creation, or industrial pollution.

## Globalisation, technology and transnational corporations

Globalisation is the increasing interconnectedness of economies, societies and cultures through trade, investment, migration, information and technology. Key drivers include advances in transport, communications and digital technology, the liberalisation of trade, and the rise of transnational corporations (TNCs). TNCs such as Toyota, Unilever or Apple operate across many countries, locating different parts of their production where costs, skills and access to markets are advantageous. Globalisation brings opportunities: foreign direct investment can create jobs, transfer technology and increase exports. It also brings challenges: local producers may be outcompeted, working conditions can be poor in some factories, and economic benefits may be unevenly distributed. In your answers, distinguish local, national and global impacts. For example, a TNC factory in a developing country might raise local employment and incomes while also creating environmental pressures and dependency on a single employer. Discuss how governments and communities can seek to maximise benefits—through training, regulation and infrastructure—while minimising negatives such as exploitation or environmental damage.

## Food production and food security

Understanding agricultural systems means recognising inputs (land, labour, capital, fertilisers and technology), processes (ploughing, planting, irrigation, harvesting, storage) and outputs (crops, livestock products and waste). Farming systems vary from subsistence agriculture, where families produce mainly for their own needs, to commercial farming aimed at national or global markets. Intensive agriculture uses high levels of inputs to produce large outputs per hectare, whereas extensive farming uses far more land with lower yields per hectare. Food shortages arise from a mix of natural and human causes: droughts, floods, pests and soil degradation reduce yields; poor transport, conflict, low investment and unequal distribution prevent food from reaching people. Historical and contemporary examples include droughts in the Horn of Africa causing famines, and conflicts disrupting supply chains in several regions. Solutions include improving irrigation and storage, investing in seeds and technology, strengthening distribution networks and international aid in emergencies. Sustainable agricultural practices—such as integrated pest management, agroforestry and precision farming—help increase productivity while reducing environmental harm. When studying case studies for exams, be ready to describe a specific farm or region and explain how local conditions and wider economic policies affect food security.

## Industry, tourism and changing employment patterns

Industry involves inputs such as raw materials, energy and labour, transformation processes in factories, and outputs that include products and industrial waste. Location decisions for factories are influenced by access to raw materials, labour costs, transport links, markets and political factors such as taxes or incentives. Industrial zones, for example special economic zones in China or industrial estates in Europe, concentrate factories and supply services that reduce costs and support production. Over recent decades many developed countries experienced deindustrialisation: manufacturing jobs declined as factories closed or relocated to lower‑cost countries. This has transformed regional economies and social landscapes.

Tourism is another major economic activity that grows as transport becomes cheaper and leisure time increases. Destinations with attractive natural or cultural landscapes, good infrastructure and effective marketing can develop large tourism industries, as seen in locations such as Bali, the Mediterranean coast and many national parks. Tourism brings income, jobs and foreign exchange, but it can also cause overcrowding, environmental degradation, rising living costs for locals and seasonal employment. Sustainable tourism planning aims to manage visitor numbers, protect natural and cultural assets and ensure benefits reach local communities. In exam answers, use specific examples to evaluate the balance of costs and benefits and suggest practical management strategies.

## Energy, water and resource management

Energy supply is central to development, and countries rely on a mix of non‑renewable fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), nuclear power and renewable sources (hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass). Each source has advantages and disadvantages: fossil fuels are energy‑dense and dispatchable but contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and are finite; nuclear power provides reliable, low‑carbon energy but raises concerns about radioactive waste and safety; renewables reduce emissions but often require large areas, storage solutions and grid adaptation. Energy security—the reliability and affordability of supply—affects economic stability and growth, and policies often aim to balance environmental goals with energy needs.

Water is another essential resource with different supply methods such as reservoirs and dams, groundwater wells and boreholes, and desalination in arid coastal states. Water use patterns differ by development level: agriculture often uses the largest share in lower‑income countries, while industrial and domestic use become more significant as economies modernise. Water scarcity can result from physical shortages, overuse, pollution, population growth and poor infrastructure. Examples include urban water stress in rapidly growing cities and the near‑crisis known as Cape Town’s “Day Zero.” Effective water management includes demand‑management measures, improved irrigation efficiency, wastewater treatment and equitable allocation. For exams, be prepared to compare methods of supply and weigh their economic, social and environmental costs and benefits.

## Environmental risks of economic development and sustainable solutions

Economic activities can create significant environmental risks at local and global scales. Soil erosion and desertification can follow intensive farming, deforestation and overgrazing, reducing land productivity. Industrial and urban development generate water, air and visual pollution, while burning fossil fuels drives enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations and climate change. Coastal development and dredging can damage mangroves and coral reefs, reducing natural protection against storms. These risks threaten livelihoods, biodiversity and long‑term economic prospects.

Sustainable development is the response: it seeks to meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. Practical approaches include resource conservation, pollution control, reforestation, protected areas, cleaner production technologies and circular economy principles that reduce waste by reusing and recycling materials. Policy frameworks such as environmental regulations, economic incentives for green technologies, and international agreements aim to steer development onto more sustainable pathways. When writing exam answers, link specific economic activities to environmental impacts and then to realistic mitigation or adaptation strategies, using case studies such as managed reforestation projects or renewable energy programmes to illustrate success and limitations.

## Exam technique

When preparing answers on economic development, globalisation and economic sectors, make sure each response addresses the command words precisely and balances factual knowledge with analysis and evaluation. For definitions and short explanation questions use clear, concise sentences that define the term and give one or two brief examples. For questions that ask you to describe or explain, organise your paragraphs to move from a clear statement (topic sentence) to explanation, then to specific evidence or an example. For extended or evaluative questions, structure your answer into two or three linked paragraphs that cover causes, consequences and at least one balanced judgement or evaluation. Use case studies actively: set the scene briefly with location and scale, give concrete facts (for example, industry types, numbers employed or a policy enacted), and link those facts to the broader geographical concepts in the question. Examiners look for AO1 knowledge, AO2 use of data and maps, and AO3 judgement and evaluation, so aim to include each element where appropriate.

Manage your time by noting the mark allocation and sub‑marks on the paper, using them as a guide to the length and depth expected. For resource‑based questions, extract only the relevant information from the resource and avoid unnecessary memorised detail. When using statistics or figures in an answer, explain what they show rather than just repeating them. In evaluation questions, always offer both positive and negative points and finish with a clear conclusion that weighs the evidence. Practice applying the same case study to different question types so you can adapt details quickly in the exam. Finally, present your writing clearly, label any simple diagrams if they help your explanation, and make sure each paragraph contributes directly to answering the question.
