# Urban land use and urbanisation (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## What urban land use and urbanisation mean, and why they matter
Urban land use describes how different activities are arranged across a town or city: where shops, offices, houses, factories, parks and transport routes are located and why. Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of a country’s population comes to live in towns and cities. Together these ideas explain how cities grow and change, how people are organised in space, and how places provide the services and jobs that shape daily life. Understanding urban land use and urbanisation helps you explain contemporary issues such as housing shortages, traffic congestion and social inequality, and it shows what choices planners and communities make to manage growth and environmental impact.

## Patterns of urban land use and the models that help explain them
Geographers use models to describe the common patterns of land use found in many cities, not to suggest every city looks the same. The concentric zone model (Burgess) imagines zones radiating out from a compact central business district (CBD) to inner-city housing and then suburbs. The sector model (Hoyt) explains how certain activities spread outwards along transport corridors, so industry or high-class housing forms wedge-shaped sectors. The multiple nuclei model recognises that many cities have more than one centre: a CBD may coexist with shopping centres, industrial estates and high-tech business parks that develop in different places. In reality, urban land use is shaped by accessibility, land value, historical development and physical features. The CBD often has high land values and tall buildings because businesses need visibility and accessibility. Residential areas vary by housing type and price: inner-city terraces and flats are close to work and services, suburbs are usually lower density with larger gardens, while the urban fringe may include new housing estates, retail parks and industrial zones. The rural-urban fringe is the zone of transition where countryside is being converted to urban uses; this is often where urban sprawl and new developments occur.

## Why land use changes over time
Cities are dynamic. Economic shifts, population growth, new transport links and changing tastes all drive land use change. Deindustrialisation in many developed cities has led to the decline of inner-city factories and the redevelopment of brownfield sites into housing and leisure facilities, as seen in docklands regeneration in London or the transformation of former industrial zones into creative and residential quarters in parts of Manchester. Gentrification is the process by which wealthier people move into poorer inner-city areas, renovating homes and changing the retail and service mix; this can bring investment but also price local residents out. Suburbanisation historically pulled people and shops out of city centres into suburbs and edge-of-town shopping centres, encouraged by car ownership. More recently, counter-urbanisation and the growth of commuter towns show people sometimes move away from dense urban cores in search of more space while remaining linked by transport. Transport improvements such as new rail lines or motorways often stimulate new corridors of development, changing the shape of cities and the location of high-value land.

## Urban problems: causes, examples and their human and environmental impacts
Rapid or poorly managed urban growth produces a range of problems. Air pollution from vehicles and industry affects public health, while noise and visual pollution reduce quality of life. Traffic congestion wastes time, increases emissions and can limit access to services. Housing problems include shortages, overcrowding and poor-quality homes; in many cities a stark contrast exists between affluent neighbourhoods and deprived areas with inadequate services. Inequality is both a social and spatial problem: employment opportunities, schools and healthcare may be concentrated in some parts of the city while other areas suffer neglect. Urban sprawl consumes farmland and wildlife habitats on the city fringe and can increase flood risk by replacing permeable ground with concrete. Waste disposal and sewage management may be inadequate in fast-growing cities, causing pollution of rivers and coastal waters. Conflicts over land use arise when different groups want the same land for different purposes, such as developers wanting to build on greenfield sites while local communities seek to protect open space.

## Urbanisation and the characteristics of squatter settlements
Urbanisation happens for many reasons. Push factors in rural areas often include poor income prospects, environmental problems such as drought, limited access to services and lack of social opportunity. Pull factors in cities include the prospect of jobs, better education and healthcare, and social networks that support new migrants. Natural increase — higher birth rates than death rates — also contributes to city population growth. When urban growth is very rapid, formal housing provision usually cannot keep pace and informal settlements, often called squatter settlements, shantytowns or favelas, develop. These areas characteristically have insecure tenure, simple self-built housing, overcrowding, limited access to clean water and sanitation, and poor infrastructure. Examples include Dharavi in Mumbai, the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Kibera in Nairobi and informal settlements on the outskirts of Lagos. While such settlements often lack services, they are vibrant economic and social spaces where many residents work in informal jobs, small-scale manufacturing or service activities. The long-term presence of these communities challenges planners to find realistic, humane solutions that balance people’s rights, health and livelihoods.

## Managing urban change: planning, policies and sustainable approaches
Managing urban land use and rapid urbanisation involves a mix of planning, investment and policy. Urban plans can steer growth toward brownfield regeneration rather than greenfield development, protecting countryside and minimising sprawl. Policies that promote higher-density, mixed-use neighbourhoods near public transport aim to reduce car dependency and encourage walkable communities; this approach is often referred to as transit-oriented development. Affordable housing can be provided through social housing programs, inclusionary zoning, and public–private partnerships, while slum-upgrading schemes improve basic services, roads and drainage without forcibly displacing residents. Infrastructure investment in public transport, sewage systems, waste disposal and clean energy reduces environmental impacts and improves quality of life. Green infrastructure, such as parks, street trees and sustainable drainage systems, helps manage storm water and provides recreational space. Economic strategies that decentralise jobs, for example creating new business districts or industrial zones outside the main city centre, can reduce commuting pressures. Internationally, different combinations of these approaches are used: some cities pursue compact-city policies with strict green belts, others rely on decentralisation and improved regional planning, and many invest in in-situ upgrading of informal settlements because relocation options are limited or socially damaging.

## Using case studies effectively in teaching and revision
Case studies are essential for demonstrating the real-world relevance of theory. A good urban case study should describe the city (country, size, recent growth rate), explain the specific land-use patterns or urban problems being studied, give clear evidence such as statistics or maps, and show the solutions attempted and their outcomes. For example, studying Mumbai can illustrate extreme urbanisation, the coexistence of high-rise business districts and dense informal settlements, and a range of responses from slum upgrading projects to transport expansion. A case study of a European city such as Barcelona or Freiburg can be used to illustrate brownfield redevelopment, pedestrianisation and sustainable mobility. When preparing for exams, choose one or two core city case studies you know well and make sure you can explain causes, consequences and specific examples of policies. Use labelled diagrams and simple sketches to show land-use zones, and practise explaining why certain land uses are located where they are by referring to accessibility, land value and historical development. Compare contrasting examples: a rapidly growing city in a developing country versus a post-industrial city in a developed country, so you can discuss differing challenges and policy choices.

## Exam technique
Answer questions by first making sure you understand the command word and how many marks are available. For descriptive questions, use precise geographical terms such as CBD, inner city, urban fringe, gentrification and mixed-use development. When explaining causes or effects, link processes clearly: for example, explain how rural-to-urban migration (cause) increases demand for housing (effect), which may lead to the growth of informal settlements. For higher-mark questions, include a short case study or named example to support your points and aim to balance causes, impacts and solutions where appropriate. Use simple diagrams—such as a labelled land-use model or a sketch showing a traffic corridor—to illustrate patterns and save time on writing. Manage time by allocating marks to minutes (for example, for a 10-mark question spend about 12–15 minutes) and use the sub-mark breakdown on the paper as a guide for depth. In evaluation questions, weigh up different viewpoints and finish with a concise judgement that reflects evidence you have given. Finally, practise with past-style resources: interpret maps, photographs and short data extracts, and always make sure any reference to case studies is specific and linked to the question asked.
