# Rivers: processes, landforms and flooding (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## What is a river and how does a drainage basin work?
A river is a natural channel through which water flows downhill under the influence of gravity, collecting water from a defined area called a drainage basin. The drainage basin includes all the land drained by the river and its tributaries, bounded by a watershed or drainage divide. Within the basin water moves in many ways: intercepted by leaves and by buildings, soaked into the soil (infiltration), moved slowly through the soil as throughflow, stored and returned as groundwater flow, or travelling rapidly over the surface as overland flow. These inputs and outputs, together with the amount and intensity of rainfall, determine the river’s discharge — the volume of water passing a point each second — and the river’s behaviour at different places and times. Understanding the drainage basin as a system, with stores (snow, soil moisture, groundwater) and flows (surface runoff, groundwater flow), is the starting point for explaining why rivers erode, transport and deposit material, and why they sometimes flood.

## Processes that shape rivers: erosion, transport and deposition
Rivers constantly change the landscape through three linked processes. Erosion breaks material away from the bed and banks; transport carries sediment downstream; deposition drops material where the river’s energy falls. Erosion takes several forms: hydraulic action occurs when the force of moving water dislodges particles from the bank and bed, abrasion (or corrasion) happens when rock fragments hurled along the bed grind away the channel, attrition reduces the size of bedload by collision and chipping, and solution involves chemical weathering where soluble minerals dissolve in the water. The way sediment moves depends on its size and the river’s energy. Large boulders may be moved by traction, rolling along the bed; pebbles often move by saltation, bouncing in short hops; fine silt and clay remain in suspension and make the river turbid; soluble minerals travel in solution. Deposition happens when discharge and velocity fall, for example on the inner bend of a meander, where the river’s energy is lower, or when a river enters a lake or the sea and loses velocity, forming a delta. These processes operate differently in the upper, middle and lower courses of a river, producing distinctive landforms.

## River profiles and key landforms from source to mouth
A river’s long profile typically slopes steeply in the upper course and levels out toward the mouth, forming a concave curve. In the upper course, vertical erosion dominates because steep gradients give the river high energy directed downwards. This creates features such as V-shaped valleys, interlocking spurs and waterfalls. Waterfalls form where a band of resistant rock overlays softer rock; the softer rock is eroded more quickly, creating a plunge pool and undercutting the resistant cap rock. Over time the overhang collapses and the waterfall retreats upstream, leaving a steep-sided gorge. On a smaller scale, potholes are circular holes drilled into the bedrock by turbulent eddies spinning pebbles.

In the middle course the gradient eases and lateral (sideways) erosion becomes important, leading to the development of wider valleys and meanders. A meander is a sweeping bend where the fastest flow is on the outer bend, creating a river cliff, while slower flow on the inner bend causes deposition and builds a slip-off slope. When a meander neck is cut through during a flood or by continued erosion, the river may take a new, shorter course and abandon the old loop as an oxbow lake.

The lower course is characterised by low gradients, wide floodplains and extensive deposition. Repeated flooding lays down fine alluvium across the floodplain, making soils fertile. Close to the mouth, a river may build a delta when its sediment load is deposited faster than tides and waves can remove it. Deltas come in different shapes — arcuate, bird’s-foot, or cuspate — depending on the balance of river flow, waves and tides. Natural levees can form along the channel after floods, when coarser material drops near the banks, leaving finer sediment across the floodplain.

## Hydrographs and the causes of flooding
A hydrograph is a useful way to analyse how a river responds to a rainfall event by showing discharge over time. Key features are the peak discharge, lag time (the delay between peak rainfall and peak discharge), rising limb, and falling limb. The shape of a hydrograph depends on basin characteristics and the nature of the rainfall. A small, steep, impermeable basin with high drainage density and intense short rainfall produces a flashy hydrograph with a short lag time and high peak discharge, making flooding more likely and more sudden. In contrast, a large basin with permeable soils, dense vegetation and gentle rainfall has a more subdued hydrograph with a long lag time and lower peak discharge.

Flooding has multiple causes. Meteorological causes include prolonged heavy rain, intense convective storms, or rapid snowmelt. Physical factors that increase flood risk are steep catchments, impermeable geology, already saturated soils, and limited floodplain storage. Human factors are often decisive in urban areas: conversion of permeable surfaces to concrete increases surface runoff and shortens lag time; deforestation reduces interception and increases runoff; poor land management can increase soil erosion and sedimentation, reducing channel capacity. Dam failure and extreme tidal surges can also lead to catastrophic flooding, particularly in low-lying deltaic or estuarine areas.

## Impacts and opportunities of living near rivers
Rivers present both valuable opportunities and serious risks. Floodplains and deltas are prized for agriculture because seasonal flooding deposits nutrient-rich alluvium, and river water supports irrigation, fishing and transport. Many major cities developed on floodplains or at river mouths to exploit trade and water supply, so living near rivers often brings economic benefits and fertile land. However, floods can destroy homes, infrastructure and crops, disrupting livelihoods and causing loss of life. Riverbank erosion can undermine land and property, while polluted rivers can harm health and ecosystems. In deltas, additional hazards such as storm surges and sea-level rise increase vulnerability, especially for densely populated, low-lying regions like parts of Bangladesh or the Nile delta. Weighing these trade-offs is central to planning and management.

## Managing rivers and reducing flood risk
Flood management uses a mix of hard engineering, soft engineering and planning measures to reduce flood hazard and exposure. Hard engineering options include dams and reservoirs to store floodwater, channel straightening to speed flow, flood relief channels to divert excess water, and raised embankments or levees to contain rivers. These methods can be effective but are expensive, can transfer risk downstream, and may harm ecosystems. Soft engineering focuses on working with natural processes: floodplain zoning prevents development in high-risk areas; afforestation increases interception and reduces runoff; restoring wetlands and reconnecting rivers to their floodplains can provide natural storage and biodiversity benefits. Sustainable drainage systems in urban areas, such as permeable paving, green roofs and detention basins, mimic natural drainage and reduce peak flows. Flood forecasting and early warning systems combined with effective evacuation plans and community awareness are essential, especially where hard defences cannot prevent all flooding. Integrated river basin management, which considers the whole drainage basin and balances social, economic and ecological needs, is widely promoted as the most sustainable approach.

## River fieldwork and the skills you need
Studying rivers in the field develops practical skills that are valuable in both Paper 2 and coursework or its alternative. Useful measurements include channel width and depth, which together give cross-sectional area, and velocity, which allows a simple estimate of discharge when multiplied by channel area. Pebble size and shape surveys along the channel can show changes in bedload downstream, and profile surveys reveal channel form. When interpreting maps and aerial photographs, look for evidence of valley shape, meanders, oxbow lakes, levees and human modifications such as embankments or straightened channels. Hydrographs and tables of discharge data require attention to scales, units and trends: be familiar with calculating mean and range, recognizing patterns, and linking them to basin factors such as land use or rainfall intensity. In mapwork, being able to read contour spacing to discuss gradient and to identify drainage density, tributary patterns and floodplain extent will earn marks. Field sketches, clear labeling and the choice of appropriate graphs (for example, line graphs for discharge or bar charts for pebble size) are also important for presenting evidence.

## Exam technique
In exams, answer the question that is asked and use the command words precisely: "describe" asks for characteristics and patterns, "explain" requires causes and links, and "suggest" or "evaluate" demands reasoning and balance. When a question asks for a named case study, use specific details: dates, location, causes, impacts and management measures, and evaluate how successful those measures have been. For resource-based questions, treat each diagram, map extract or photograph as evidence: describe what you can see, interpret what it tells you about processes or landforms, and link observations to physical explanations. In longer answers, structure your paragraphing so that each point is followed by explanation and, where possible, example or evidence. For calculations and mapwork in Paper 2, show steps clearly and check units; for hydrographs, refer to lag time and peak discharge and relate them to basin characteristics. When evaluating management options, balance pros and cons and consider environmental and social consequences. Finally, time management is crucial: spend a few minutes planning longer answers and use the mark allocations printed on the paper to gauge how much detail to include. Clear, geographically precise language and well-chosen examples will make your answers stand out.
