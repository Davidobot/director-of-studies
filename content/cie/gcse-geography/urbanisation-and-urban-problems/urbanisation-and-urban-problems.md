# Urbanisation, squatter settlements and urban problems (GCSE Geography Cambridge International)

## Overview of urbanisation
Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of a country's population lives in towns and cities. At GCSE level you should be comfortable describing urbanisation both as a long-term global trend and as a more rapid process in many low‑ and middle‑income countries over recent decades. Urbanisation happens because populations grow, because rural settlements shrink as people leave, and because places that were once rural become reclassified as urban. Measured as the percentage of people living in urban areas, urbanisation is closely linked to economic change: industrialisation, the growth of services and transport improvements all concentrate jobs and services in towns and cities. The result is a landscape of expanding built-up areas, denser housing, and new patterns of land use such as industrial estates, suburbs and informal settlements.

## Why cities grow: push and pull factors
Rapid urban growth is driven by a mix of push factors that drive people out of rural areas and pull factors that attract people to cities. Push factors include poor harvests, soil exhaustion, drought or flooding that make rural livelihoods precarious, and limited access to services such as schools and clinics. Conflict and lack of rural investment also push people away. Pull factors include the prospect of wage employment, better education and health services, improved transport and communication, and the chance of social mobility. In many developing-country cities natural increase (the excess of births over deaths) adds further to growth because young migrants raise birth rates in the urban population. Migrants may move to capital cities or to nearby regional centres; both patterns help to explain why megacities like Mumbai, Lagos and Jakarta have grown so quickly.

## Squatter settlements: characteristics and causes
Squatter settlements, sometimes called informal settlements or slums, are a visible outcome of rapid urban growth when formal housing and services cannot keep pace with demand. Typical characteristics include high population density, improvised or substandard housing built of cheap materials, insecure land tenure, limited access to water and sanitation, poor drainage, and a lack of formal electricity, waste collection and streets. These settlements often develop on marginal land—steep slopes, floodplains, river banks or industrial fringe areas—because land there is unused and easier to occupy.

Causes are both structural and immediate. Rapid rural–urban migration supplies labour at a speed public housing programmes cannot match. Low incomes and high land prices mean many newcomers cannot afford formal housing, so they build incrementally where they can. Weak land regulation and corruption sometimes allow illegal occupation to persist. An important feature to remember is that squatter settlements are dynamic: many are self-organised communities where residents build, trade and form local organisations, and improvements often happen from within rather than only by external intervention.

## Urban problems: social, economic and environmental
The pressures of rapid urban growth generate a range of interlinked problems. Social issues include overcrowding, lack of affordable housing and inadequate access to education and healthcare. High levels of inequality are common: affluent gated communities and well-served central business districts may sit close to neighbourhoods without piped water or flushing toilets. Economically, urban areas can offer jobs, but informal employment and underemployment are widespread; many people work in unstable, low-paid services or casual labour without social protection.

Environmental problems arise from concentration of people, industry and transport. Air pollution from vehicles and industry causes respiratory illness and contributes to poor quality of life. Traffic congestion reduces productivity, causes long commuting times and increases emissions. Poor waste management and blocked drainage cause pollution and raise flood risk. Cities built with lots of concrete and little vegetation experience higher temperatures than surrounding countryside, an effect known as the urban heat island. Settlements on steep slopes or floodplains are especially vulnerable to landslides and flooding during heavy rain or storms.

## Impacts on rural areas and wider consequences
Urbanisation affects rural areas as well as cities. Rural areas may suffer depopulation of working-age adults, leading to labour shortages in agriculture and an ageing rural population. Remittances sent home from urban migrants can boost rural incomes and change consumption patterns, but long-term rural decline can reduce local services and investment. Environmentally, expansion of peri-urban areas converts farmland and natural habitats into housing, industry and transport corridors, fragmenting ecosystems and increasing demand for water and energy. National development patterns also change: governments may prioritise investments around large cities, reinforcing regional inequalities.

## Case studies and responses: examples of upgrading and policy
When studying urbanisation you should be ready to use a case study to illustrate causes, impacts and solutions. Mumbai is a clear example of rapid urban growth in a developing country. A long history of industrial and service-sector jobs has attracted migrants from rural Maharashtra and beyond. Large informal settlements such as Dharavi illustrate the characteristics of squatter settlements: extremely high density, informal small-scale industry, limited formal services and insecure tenure. Responses in and around Mumbai include slum upgrading projects, efforts to provide sanitation, and debates about redevelopment that balance housing needs against commercial pressures.

Other useful examples to remember are Rio de Janeiro and its favelas, where the Favela Bairro programme sought to improve infrastructure, provide paved streets, drainage and social services while leaving community structures intact. In Karachi, the Orangi Pilot Project shows the power of community-led solutions: residents organised to install and pay for sanitation networks, demonstrating that low-cost, locally-managed interventions can be effective where state provision is lacking. In Lagos, informal settlements such as Makoko are built over water and face unique hazards; community initiatives and NGO projects have focused on education, health clinics and improvements to waste disposal.

Policy responses can be grouped into prevention, upgrading and long‑term planning. Prevention includes strengthening rural economies so people have incentives to stay, and planning for affordable housing before shortages become acute. Upgrading involves improving services and tenure in existing informal settlements—providing water, sanitation, roads, electricity and legal recognition so residents can invest in their homes. Long-term planning includes investing in mass transit to reduce congestion, using zoning and green belts to limit sprawl, encouraging mixed-use development to shorten commutes, and protecting floodplains and steep slopes from settlement. Some developed cities use market-based approaches such as congestion charging to reduce car use; London’s congestion charge is an example of a demand-management tool that can be adapted in other contexts.

## Sustainable strategies and innovations
Sustainable urban management tries to meet present needs without compromising future generations. Integrated strategies combine improvements to housing, transport, sanitation and the economy. Transit-oriented development encourages higher-density growth around public transport nodes to reduce car dependence. Green infrastructure, such as urban parks, street trees and sustainable drainage systems, helps reduce runoff, improve air quality and moderate urban temperatures. Waste-to-energy plants and organized recycling schemes can cut landfill and create jobs. A very effective approach is participatory planning: involving community groups, local government and NGOs in designing and implementing schemes helps ensure solutions are appropriate, affordable and maintainable. Microfinance and incremental housing policies enable households to improve homes over time, while legal tenure gives them confidence to invest.

When evaluating strategies remember trade-offs. Large-scale housing redevelopment can displace residents if not carefully managed, while strict enforcement against informal settlements without alternatives can worsen homelessness. Effective policy often requires combining short-term upgrades with long-term planning and finance.

## Exam technique
When answering examination questions on urbanisation, squatter settlements and urban problems, always start by ensuring you understand the command word and what the question asks you to do. For a describe question, give clear characteristics; for explain, link causes and consequences; for evaluate or suggest, weigh advantages and disadvantages and include a judgement. Use a named case study to support points: briefly set the scene (where and why the city has grown), then use specific details (for example, the type of informal housing, particular hazards, or an upgrading programme and its outcomes). Structure your answers so that each paragraph makes one clear point and is developed with reasons, an example and, where appropriate, a consequence or evaluation. Where resources such as maps, graphs or photographs are provided, base your answers on the evidence in the resource as well as on your geographical knowledge. For extended questions, include a short conclusion that answers the question directly and reflects on the relative importance of the factors you discussed. Manage your time by noting the marks available for each question and using the mark allocation to guide the length of your answer. Finally, practise drawing and labelling simple diagrams such as an urban land‑use model or a sketch map of a slum showing hazards and services; a neat, labelled diagram can add clarity and gain marks when it supports your prose.
