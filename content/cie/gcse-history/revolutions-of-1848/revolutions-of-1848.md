# Revolutions of 1848 (GCSE History Cambridge International)

## Background: liberalism, nationalism and the long 1840s
By the middle of the nineteenth century Europe had been reshaped by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. The Congress of Vienna (1814–15) attempted to restore the old order, but the ideas of liberalism and nationalism had already spread. Liberalism offered demands for constitutions, representative government, free press and legal equality. Nationalism encouraged peoples who shared language and culture to seek their own states or greater influence within multi-national empires. The 1830 revolutions in France and parts of Italy and Belgium showed that these ideas could produce unrest, and the growth of industrialisation created new social groups—urban workers and an expanding middle class—whose interests often clashed with conservative rulers. By the late 1840s these long-term developments meant that Europe was intellectually and socially primed for upheaval.

## Immediate causes and the springboard of 1848
The revolutions of 1848 were not the result of a single cause but of a combination of political, economic and social pressures that reached a breaking point. Political repression under conservative regimes, censorship of the press and exclusion of the bourgeoisie from meaningful power produced a widespread desire for reform. Economic hardship in 1846–47, driven by poor harvests, rising food prices and an industrial downturn, left many urban workers and rural poor desperate. Food shortages and unemployment made mass protest possible. In addition, the role of events elsewhere should not be underestimated: news and revolutionary ideas spread quickly between cities and regions, so a successful uprising in one place inspired agitation in another. The February 1848 outbreak in Paris acted as the immediate spark for a wave of revolts across the continent: when the July Monarchy in France collapsed and King Louis-Philippe abdicated, demonstrators and reformers from Vienna to Milan seized the moment to press their own demands.

## France: revolution, republic and reaction
France was the spark and the template of 1848. The February Revolution in Paris toppled the conservative July Monarchy and led to the proclamation of the Second Republic. Liberals and social reformers worked together at first: there were hopes for universal male suffrage and social measures such as national workshops to provide work for the unemployed. However, tensions between middle-class liberals, who wanted order and economic stability, and radical socialists and workers, who demanded more fundamental social change, quickly surfaced. The June Days of 1848 saw a violent clash in Paris when the government closed the national workshops, prompting an armed workers’ uprising that was brutally suppressed. The short-lived republic survived long enough to elect Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte as president in December 1848, whose appeal to order and national prestige foreshadowed the end of the republican experiment when he staged a coup in 1851 and later became Emperor Napoleon III.

## Italian states: national aspirations and the Roman interlude
In the Italian peninsula 1848 produced uprisings against Austrian domination in the north and against conservative rulers in other states. In Lombardy and Venetia, which were under Austrian control, popular risings such as the “Five Days” of Milan in March 1848 temporarily forced the Austrians to withdraw. Charles Albert of Sardinia-Piedmont declared war on Austria in what was partly a dynastic and partly a national project, but his defeats at Custoza and Novara in 1848–49 showed the limits of the popular movement when confronted with a professional imperial army. In central Italy the Roman Republic of 1849, proclaimed after Pope Pius IX fled Rome, brought together figures such as Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi in an attempt to create a republican Italy. This experiment was crushed when French troops intervened to restore the Pope. The 1848–49 revolts in Italy demonstrated the strength of Italian nationalism but also its fragmentation and the decisive advantage held by conservative powers, especially Austria and France, in suppressing local revolts.

## German lands and the Frankfurt Parliament
The German states experienced widespread agitation in 1848, especially in the larger states such as Prussia and in the cities. Middle-class liberals demanded national unity, constitutions and parliamentary government. The result was the convocation of the Frankfurt Parliament in May 1848, an assembly of delegates from across the German states that attempted to draft a liberal constitution and offer a unified crown to a German monarch. The Parliament’s debates revealed deep divisions: liberals disagreed over whether a united Germany should include Austria (a “Grossdeutschland”) or be led by Prussia as a predominantly German state (a “Kleindeutschland”); conservatives and monarchs resisted surrendering sovereign power. When the parliament offered the imperial crown to King Frederick William IV of Prussia, he refused to accept a crown “from the gutter,” rejecting a constitution that implied popular sovereignty. Without the support of the great rulers and their armies, the Frankfurt Parliament was powerless, and by 1849 conservative forces had reasserted control across the German lands.

## The Austrian Empire and the challenge of multi-ethnic politics
The Habsburg monarchy faced perhaps the most severe threat to its complex multi-national structure. Vienna erupted in March 1848, and the powerful statesman Metternich, the symbol of conservative reaction in Europe, resigned and fled. The Hungarian leader Lajos Kossuth pushed for greater autonomy and a Hungarian parliament, provoking a passionate national struggle that combined liberal constitutional demands with national independence. The Habsburg response combined military force with political manoeuvre, but only with external help could the imperial centre reassert itself. In 1849 the Russian Tsar sent troops to assist Austria, and together they crushed the Hungarian revolt. These events exposed the fragility of empires containing many national groups and showed how solidarity among conservative monarchs could defeat revolutions that threatened dynastic order.

## Why most revolutions failed, and what they did achieve
Although the revolutions of 1848 spread rapidly and achieved immediate gains—constitutions, temporary liberal governments and the toppling of some rulers—most were defeated within a year. Several common reasons explain this failure. First, revolutionary groups were deeply divided: middle-class liberals feared social revolution and were unwilling to support radical economic or social demands, while workers and peasants often wanted more radical change than the liberals would countenance. Second, revolutionaries frequently lacked unified leadership or clear programs that could translate popular energy into lasting institutions. Third, the rulers retained control of the armed forces and, where necessary, could call on foreign intervention; the conservative coalition among monarchs proved decisive in many cases. Finally, an economic recovery in 1848–49 reduced immediate pressures and allowed governments to re-establish order. Despite these setbacks, the revolutions were not without lasting effects. They weakened the old diplomatic order symbolised by Metternich, stimulated national movements (which later helped bring about the unifications of Italy and Germany), spread the idea that mass politics could be powerful, and forced some rulers to make limited reforms such as constitutions or administrative changes. In other words, 1848 was both a revolutionary failure in the short term and a seedbed for later nineteenth-century change.

## Interpreting 1848: contested significance
Historians and students should recognise that the significance of 1848 can be seen in different ways. One interpretation emphasises failure: monarchies were restored, and the social goals of workers and peasants were not achieved, so 1848 was a “revolution of 1848” that fizzled out. Another interpretation stresses the long-term impact: the revolutions spread political consciousness, legitimised demands for national self-determination and put liberal ideas onto the political agenda so firmly that later nineteenth-century developments—such as the unifications of Italy and Germany—became possible. For teaching, it is useful to balance these views: evaluate short-term outcomes and then link to longer-term consequences, showing how ideas and movements that seemed to fail in 1848 resurfaced later in new forms and under different leaders.

## Revision priorities and useful examples
When revising this topic, focus on clear, specific examples that show causes, events and consequences. For causes, be ready to explain the role of liberalism and nationalism, the economic crisis of the late 1840s, and the influence of previous uprisings. For events, memorise core episodes such as the February Revolution in Paris, the June Days, the Five Days of Milan, Charles Albert’s wars against Austria, the Roman Republic and French intervention, the convocation and collapse of the Frankfurt Parliament, and the suppression of the Hungarian uprising with Russian help. For consequences, distinguish between immediate reactions (repression, restorations) and longer-term effects (constitutionalism in some states, encouragement of national unification, and the decline of Metternichian diplomacy). Use individuals as anchors in essays: Louis-Philippe and Louis-Napoleon in France, Mazzini and Garibaldi in Italy, Frederick William IV and Bismarck’s later conservative nationalism in Germany, and Metternich and Kossuth in the Habsburg lands. Being able to place dates and to explain who did what and why will strengthen AO1 knowledge and support AO2 explanations.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on the revolutions of 1848 requires clear organisation, precise knowledge, and balanced judgement. Begin essays by directly addressing the question with a brief thesis that sets out your argument. For questions that ask “Were the revolutions of 1848 important?” or “Did the revolutions change anything?” structure your answer to consider short-term and long-term effects and to weigh regional differences; for example, note the immediate restoration of conservative order alongside the later influence on Italian and German unification. In Section A style structured essays (parts a, b, c), use part (a) to provide a focused factual account, part (b) to explain causes or consequences with specific examples, and part (c) to argue and evaluate the overall importance, comparing different places and timeframes. For document questions, use each source to support or challenge the argument, evaluating origin, purpose, and content briefly, and always bring in your own knowledge beyond the sources. Time management is vital: plan each answer, write a clear introduction and conclusion, and leave time to check your argument. Use specific events and names to support claims, and when assessing “importance” consider different scales—local, national and European—and short-term versus long-term results. Finally, practice writing balanced judgements: explain why revolutions failed in 1848, but also explain the ways in which they shaped the rest of the nineteenth century.
