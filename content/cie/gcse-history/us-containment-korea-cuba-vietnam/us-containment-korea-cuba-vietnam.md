# US containment: Korea, Cuba and Vietnam case studies (GCSE History Cambridge International)

## The idea of containment and the Cold War context
Containment was the central principle of United States foreign policy after 1947. It emerged from the conviction that Soviet power and international communism sought to expand, and that American security required preventing that expansion. The policy grew out of George Kennan’s analysis of Soviet behaviour and was given political form in the Truman Doctrine and practical muscle in measures such as economic aid, military alliances and covert action. Containment was not a single action but a set of responses: providing economic help to vulnerable states, supporting friendly governments, building military alliances such as NATO, and intervening—overtly or covertly—when communist movements threatened to take power. By the 1950s American policymakers often described events through the “domino theory”: if one country fell to communism, neighbouring states might follow. This belief helped to justify intervention in several regions, most notably Korea, Cuba and Vietnam, where local conflicts became tests of how far containment could be applied.

## Korea, 1950–53: limited war and the limits of containment
Korea provides an early and important case study of containment in action. After Japan’s defeat in 1945 the peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel into Soviet-backed North Korea and US-backed South Korea. In June 1950 the North invaded the South, aiming to reunify the country by force. The United States, treating the invasion as an act of communist expansion, secured a United Nations resolution and led a multinational force to repel the attack. Initial defeats were reversed by General MacArthur’s daring amphibious landing at Inchon in September 1950, which pushed North Korean forces back and raised hopes of reunification. That optimism collapsed when China intervened late in 1950, sending large numbers of troops across the Yalu River and pushing UN forces south.

The war settled into a bloody stalemate around the original dividing line. After prolonged negotiations and heavy casualties, an armistice was signed in July 1953, returning the peninsula to a division close to the pre-war boundary. In terms of containment, Korea was a partial success: the United States and its allies prevented the entire peninsula from falling to communism, but they did not achieve reunification under a non-communist government. Korea showed both the strengths and the limits of containment. It demonstrated that the US was willing to use military force under a UN mandate and to bear significant costs to check communist aggression. At the same time, the conflict revealed the danger of escalation—in this case through Chinese intervention—and it encouraged a permanent expansion of US military commitments and resources, influencing policies such as the rearmament of West Germany and the adoption of NSC-68’s call for a major military build-up.

## Cuba, 1959–62: revolution, confrontation and the nuclear crisis
The Cuban case highlights how containment sometimes shifted from preventing expansion to responding to local revolutions that aligned with the Soviet Union. The 1959 revolution brought Fidel Castro to power and over time his regime drew closer to the USSR, especially after land reforms and nationalisations angered US business interests. The Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations feared that Cuba’s alliance with the Soviets would provide the USSR with a strategic foothold close to the United States.

The United States attempted to reverse Castro’s government through covert operations, culminating in the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The CIA-backed landing by Cuban exiles failed disastrously, strengthening Castro’s position and pushing Cuba further into the Soviet orbit. Tensions escalated through 1962 until the October discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. President Kennedy responded with a naval “quarantine” and demanded removal of the missiles. After intense negotiations the crisis was resolved when the Soviet leader agreed to withdraw the missiles in return for a public US pledge not to invade Cuba and a secret US removal of missiles from Turkey.

The Cuban Missile Crisis was a critical moment for containment. On one level it was a containment success because the United States prevented the permanent deployment of Soviet nuclear weapons in the Western Hemisphere and maintained its security perimeter. On another level it showed the limits and dangers of aggressive containment strategies: covert actions and confrontational policies had helped provoke a close brush with nuclear war. The crisis also produced important longer-term shifts: improved channels of communication between Washington and Moscow, a move towards arms control, and a more cautious approach to direct superpower confrontation.

## Vietnam, 1955–75: escalation, guerrilla warfare and the breakdown of containment
Vietnam is the most contested and costly test of US containment. After World War II Vietnamese nationalists fought the French colonial presence; the decisive defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 led to the Geneva Accords, which temporarily divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel. The United States, determined to prevent a communist takeover in the South, supported the anti-communist government of Ngo Dinh Diem and gradually increased economic and military aid. American involvement deepened after the Gulf of Tonkin incidents in 1964, which led to congressional approval for escalation. US troop numbers rose sharply from 1965 onwards as an attempt was made to defeat the communist insurgency led by the Viet Cong and to blunt the influence of North Vietnam.

American strategy combined large-scale conventional operations, search-and-destroy missions, and massive bombing campaigns over North Vietnam. At the same time the Viet Cong pursued guerrilla tactics, blending into the rural population and exploiting local nationalist sentiment. The Tet Offensive of 1968, a vast coordinated attack by communist forces across South Vietnam, shocked American public opinion despite being a military setback for the communists. The broadcast images and reports of heavy fighting undermined US political will and increased domestic opposition to the war. Successive administrations struggled to find a way to reconcile military objectives with political realities. Attempts at “pacification” and nation-building had limited success, and the strategy of “attrition” failed to break the resolve of the communists.

US withdrawal began under Nixon with the policy of Vietnamization—shifting combat responsibility to South Vietnamese forces—followed by the Paris Peace Accords of 1973. The fall of Saigon in 1975 marked the end of the Republic of South Vietnam and the unification of the country under communist control. In Vietnam containment failed: the United States could not prevent the spread of communism in Indochina. The reasons were complex. The Vietnamese conflict had strong roots in nationalism and anti-colonialism; American policymakers often misread these motives and applied conventional Cold War assumptions. The local terrain and guerrilla warfare favoured the communists, and domestic opposition to a prolonged foreign war eroded the US political will to continue fighting.

## Why outcomes differed: comparing the three case studies
Korea, Cuba and Vietnam all show different faces of containment because local conditions, international actors and American choices varied. In Korea the division dated from wartime arrangements, and the conflict quickly drew in external powers; the UN-backed military response, combined with China’s intervention and the eventual armistice, produced a stalemate that preserved South Korea. Cuba’s revolutionary nationalism combined with Soviet strategic interests to create a volatile confrontation; the US reaction avoided invasion but produced decades of hostility and an enduring American embargo. Vietnam differed because the insurgency was deeply nationalist, not merely a Soviet export; furthermore, US strategy was ill-suited to counter-guerilla warfare and domestic political limits restricted a sustained application of overwhelming force. The presence or absence of direct Soviet or Chinese military intervention also mattered, as did geography, local political structures, and the degree of legitimacy or popular support enjoyed by the actors on the ground.

Overall, containment sometimes worked in the narrow sense of preventing immediate Soviet expansion or major strategic losses, but it also often produced long-term costs, unintended consequences and moral dilemmas. The policy succeeded when the United States could combine coherent local partners, clear political objectives and sufficient, sustained resources. It struggled where nationalist movements had deep local roots or where public opinion at home constrained action.

## Longer-term consequences for US foreign policy and Cold War dynamics
The experiences in Korea, Cuba and Vietnam reshaped American strategy. Korea institutionalised a permanent US military presence in East Asia and justified large defence budgets. Cuba reinforced the importance the US placed on the Western Hemisphere and led to measures such as the economic embargo and ongoing intelligence activity. The Missile Crisis, although resolved peacefully, accelerated efforts towards arms-control agreements and established crisis-management mechanisms between superpowers. Vietnam’s legacy was perhaps the most profound politically: it prompted debates about executive war powers, led to public scepticism about interventionism, and influenced the later doctrine of more selective use of force. Collectively these case studies pushed American policy-makers to reflect on limits of military intervention, the need for better understanding of local contexts, and the value of diplomacy and alliances alongside military strength.

## Key concepts and chronology to remember
Containment should be understood as both a strategic aim and a series of practical choices. Important concepts to keep in mind include the Truman Doctrine, the domino theory, NSC-68, brinkmanship, and Vietnamization. Chronologically, the Korean War (1950–53) is an early example of conventional containment; the Cuban Revolution (1959) followed by the Bay of Pigs (1961) and Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) illustrate Cold War confrontation close to home; the Vietnam conflict (major US escalation 1965–73, fall of Saigon 1975) shows how containment could become a long, expensive struggle against nationalist guerrillas. Understanding the sequence and how each event influenced US policy helps explain shifts towards détente in the late 1960s and 1970s and the eventual adaptation of American strategy in later decades.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on containment, start by identifying exactly what the question asks: whether it focuses on causes, consequences, comparisons or judgments about success. Use specific facts and dates to anchor your points—mention key events such as Inchon, the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis dates, Gulf of Tonkin, Tet and the fall of Saigon. For structured essay questions, open with a clear thesis that answers the question, then organise your response into paragraphs each with a single main point supported by evidence and explanation. When evaluating whether containment “succeeded” or “failed,” balance strengths and weaknesses and consider different criteria for success (territorial control, strategic balance, domestic costs, long-term consequences). For document questions, assess provenance and reliability briefly, use the sources as evidence but add your own contextual knowledge, and remember that judgement must be supported by both sources and factual knowledge. Time-manage so that longer questions get more time, and always write a brief conclusion that brings your argument together and directly answers the question. Practise past papers, learn key dates and names, and be ready to explain not just what happened but why it mattered.
