# Causes of the First World War (1890–1914) (GCSE History Cambridge International)

## Overview: long-term tensions and a short-term trigger
The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 was the result of a complex mix of long-term structural tensions and the accidental chain of events set off by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914. Long-term factors include the system of alliances and rivalries among the Great Powers, an intense arms race and military planning, imperial competition overseas, rising nationalist movements—especially in the Balkans—and a diplomatic culture that sometimes rewarded firmness over compromise. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 was the immediate spark, but it was only able to lead to general war because the underlying political and military structures turned a regional crisis into a continent-wide catastrophe.

## The Alliance System and international diplomacy
From the 1870s onward European states formed defensive groupings intended to preserve security. By 1914 the major alignments were the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy, and the Triple Entente of Britain, France and Russia. These alliances were not formal in every detail, but they created two rival blocs. The Entente Cordiale (1904) between Britain and France and the Anglo–Russian Entente (1907) completed the diplomatic understanding that linked Britain, France and Russia. These arrangements had been intended to deter war by making it clear that aggression would meet united opposition; in practice they reduced diplomatic flexibility. Commitments to allies made it harder for leaders to step back from confrontations: a crisis involving one member risked pulling its partners in. At the same time, diplomacy became more secretive and competitive, and the rise of alliance politics meant that local disputes, such as those in the Balkans, could no longer be treated as purely regional problems.

It is important to remember that alliances could sometimes prevent wars as well as provoke them. For example, the system may have deterred France from attacking Germany in the 1890s. Nevertheless, by 1914 the alliance system had created a dangerous rigidity: once one power mobilised, its allies felt compelled to respond, and a limited conflict could escalate.

## The arms race and the military mind-set
The closing decades of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century saw a dramatic build-up of military power, especially in Germany, France, Britain and Russia. Germany’s decision to expand its navy under Kaiser Wilhelm II challenged Britain’s traditional sea dominance, culminating in a naval competition marked by the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906, which reset standards and intensified shipbuilding. At the same time, new weapon technologies and improvements in army organisation made the prospect of large-scale war both more conceivable and more frightening.

Crucially, military planning grew more detailed and inflexible. Germany’s Schlieffen Plan, which envisaged a rapid sweep through Belgium into France before turning east to face Russia, depended on precise timetables and rapid mobilisation. Once mobilisations began, political leaders found it hard to stop them: rail timetables, mobilisation orders and war plans created a momentum of their own. This growing “military mind-set” made the option of negotiation less likely in a crisis and increased the risk that local incidents would trigger full-scale war.

## Imperial rivalries and colonial crises
Imperial expansion and competition created a series of international tensions before 1914. In Africa and elsewhere, European powers competed for territory, prestige and markets. Crises such as Fashoda in 1898 and the Moroccan Crises of 1905 and 1911 exposed deep suspicions between the Great Powers, particularly between Germany and France, and pushed Britain closer to France. Germany’s desire for “a place in the sun” and its naval ambitions fuelled British anxiety and helped transform relationships into rivalry rather than cooperation.

Colonial disputes were not always causes of war by themselves, but they created a climate of mistrust and a catalogue of resentments. Naval and imperial competition strengthened nationalist feelings and made governments more willing to adopt assertive foreign policies. Moreover, the global nature of rivalries meant that a European war had world-wide implications: colonial troops and seas of commerce became strategic concerns, tying imperial policy to continental politics.

## The Balkans: nationalism, the ‘Eastern Question’ and repeated crises
The Balkans were often called Europe’s “powder keg” because of the intensity of nationalist agitation and the decline of Ottoman power. After the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) and the Congress of Berlin (1878), new states like Serbia and Bulgaria gained ground; many Slavs in the region sought unity and independence. Austria-Hungary feared the growth of Serbian nationalism because it threatened to stir unrest among the empire’s many Slavic subjects. Russia, portraying itself as protector of Slav and Orthodox peoples, had its own interests in the Balkans, and the great powers repeatedly found themselves on opposite sides of Balkan disputes.

The early 1900s saw a series of Balkan crises that increased tensions: Austria’s annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 caused a crisis with Serbia and Russia; the Balkan Wars of 1912–13 redrew borders and left many ethnic grievances unresolved. These conflicts intensified rivalries, hardened attitudes, and led military and political leaders to expect confrontation rather than compromise. When crises came, the Balkans were no longer peripheral; they were a theatre where the interests of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Serbia and the great powers intersected dangerously.

## The July Crisis and the assassination of Franz Ferdinand
The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by a Bosnian Serb nationalist, Gavrilo Princip, on 28 June 1914, provided the immediate spark. Austria-Hungary, seeing an opportunity to punish Serbia and suppress nationalist agitation, issued an ultimatum on 23 July that contained demands designed to be unacceptable. Serbia’s response on 25 July accepted most demands but not all; Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July.

What turned a regional declaration into a world war was the interaction of alliances, mobilisations and diplomatic decisions in the following weeks. Germany offered Austria-Hungary a "blank cheque" of support, encouraging a firm line. Russia, bound by Slavic ties and its own strategic concerns, began to mobilise to support Serbia. Germany then declared war on Russia on 1 August and on Russia’s ally France on 3 August. When German forces violated Belgian neutrality to execute the Schlieffen Plan, Britain entered the war on 4 August, citing Belgium’s neutrality among other reasons. The rapid sequence from assassination to general war shows how the systems of alliance, military plans and mobilisation timetables made escalation likely once leaders chose confrontation over restraint.

## How historians explain the outbreak: contingency, responsibility and long-term causes
There are different ways to interpret the causes of the First World War. Some historians emphasise structural causes: the alliance system, the arms race, imperial rivalries and the rise of nationalism made war likely or even almost inevitable. Others highlight contingency and the failings of leaders: poor diplomacy, misjudgements, miscommunications and political miscalculations in July 1914 turned a local crisis into a world war. Some place responsibility on particular states—Germany’s aggressive foreign policy and the “blank cheque” to Austria; Austria-Hungary’s choice to press Serbia; Russia’s willingness to mobilise; or Britain’s strategic interests and naval fears. In truth, the outbreak is best understood as the result of both long-term pressures and short-term choices: structural tensions created a dangerous context, while key decisions in the summer of 1914 removed the remaining space for peaceful compromise.

When teaching or revising this topic, it helps to distinguish between “causes” at different levels: long-term structural trends (militarism, alliances, imperialism), medium-term crises (Morocco, the Balkans), and the immediate catalyst (the assassination and the July Crisis). That distinction clarifies why the assassination mattered: it provided a focal point for pre-existing conflicts that had been building for decades.

## Making sense of significance: weighting the causes
To assess “what caused the First World War” you need to judge the relative importance of the different factors. The alliance system and military plans can be seen as especially significant because they turned a bilateral Austro-Serbian conflict into a general war; the military timetables and mobilisation plans made de-escalation difficult once they began. The arms race and imperial rivalries created an atmosphere of competition and mistrust, while Balkan nationalism supplied the immediate flashpoint. However, responsibility must also be attributed to political actors who chose to escalate: Austria-Hungary’s aggression, Germany’s encouragement, Russia’s mobilisation and the failure of diplomacy all played decisive roles. Good answers balance these explanations: show how long-term causes set the scene, then explain how short-term decisions produced the outbreak.

## Teaching tips and useful examples
When preparing students, emphasise clear examples. Use the Moroccan Crises (1905 and 1911) and the Bosnian Crisis (1908) to show how crises exposed rivalries and pushed alliances closer. Explain the significance of the Dreadnought (1906) to illustrate the naval arms race. Study the Balkan Wars of 1912–13 to show how unresolved national grievances and shifting borders increased instability. For the July Crisis, focus on the dates and diplomatic exchanges: Austria’s ultimatum to Serbia, Serbia’s partial acceptance, the German “blank cheque”, Russian mobilisation, and the sequence of declarations and invasions that followed. Encourage students to connect each example to the question of significance rather than simply narrating events.

Primary sources such as excerpts from the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum, Kaiser Wilhelm’s telegrams, or contemporary newspaper headlines are valuable for showing how leaders and publics perceived the crisis. Maps are also essential for understanding strategic choices: the location of Serbia, Austria-Hungary, Russia and the route through Belgium that the Schlieffen Plan required all help explain why actors made the choices they did.

## Exam technique
Always start by clarifying the question: if it asks “How far…” or “To what extent…”, prepare to balance factors and reach a judgement. Open with a brief introduction that outlines the main factors you will discuss and signals your tentative judgement. Structure the body of your answer in clear paragraphs, each addressing a different cause (for example: alliances and diplomacy; arms race and military planning; imperial rivalries; Balkan nationalism and the July Crisis). In each paragraph, explain the factor, give concrete evidence or an example, and analyse its importance—link the example directly back to the question. Use comparative language to weigh factors (for example, “Although imperial rivalries increased tension, the alliance system was more important because…”). Avoid pure narrative; where chronology is relevant, keep it concise and use it to support analysis.

For source-based or shorter questions, practise identifying provenance, purpose and content quickly and use these to evaluate a source’s reliability and usefulness. Always answer the question set rather than writing everything you know. Manage your time: plan your answer briefly, allocate time to each paragraph, and leave a few minutes to write a focused conclusion that restates your judgement and summarises the strongest supporting points. Finally, practise writing under timed conditions using past paper questions, and when marking practice answers, look for clarity of argument, accuracy of facts, and clear judgement—these are the elements examiners reward most.
