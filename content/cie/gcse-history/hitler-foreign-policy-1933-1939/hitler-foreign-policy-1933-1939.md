# Hitler's foreign policy and the road to WWII (1933–39) (GCSE History Cambridge International)

## Overview: the international context, 1919–1933
The path to war in 1939 must be read against the background left by the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles. The settlement of 1919 created resentments in Germany by imposing territorial losses, military restrictions and reparations; these became central grievances that radical politicians could exploit. The League of Nations, created to provide collective security, was weakened from the start by the absence of the United States and later by the inaction of its members in crises during the 1930s. Economic instability after 1929 made many states inward-looking and less willing to confront aggression. Into this fragile international system came Adolf Hitler in January 1933, determined to overturn what he and many Germans regarded as an unjust order. Understanding the road to war requires combining two kinds of explanation: the intentions and actions of Hitler and the structural weaknesses—economic, diplomatic and political—that made aggressive revision possible.

## Hitler’s aims and the ideological driving force
Hitler’s foreign policy flowed from Nazi ideology. Central aims were to overturn the Versailles settlement, unite all Germans in a Greater Germany, acquire Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe and destroy communism, which the Nazis portrayed as a Jewish-Bolshevik threat. These goals were not vague slogans; they were set out in Mein Kampf and repeated in speeches and party documents, and they shaped short- and long-term strategy. In addition to clear territorial ambitions, Hitler required rearmament and strategic alliances to secure Germany’s position. His willingness to use risk and brinkmanship, rather than moderate diplomacy, made confrontation increasingly likely as his aims required changes that other states were unwilling to accept once their security interests were directly threatened.

## Methods: rearmament, diplomacy and the use of force
From 1933 onwards the Nazi regime pursued a deliberate programme to rebuild Germany’s military and international standing. Rearmament was at first covert and illegal under Versailles, but by 1935 it became public policy, with conscription introduced and the Luftwaffe publicly revealed. Economic measures, including public works and later the Four-Year Plan of 1936, aimed to make Germany self-sufficient and ready for war. Diplomacy was used alongside force: Hitler exploited divisions among potential opponents, negotiated with rivals when useful, and used agreements to weaken collective responses. Propaganda presented German actions as peaceful and defensive, while clandestine military planning prepared for rapid moves. Where diplomacy failed, Germany often used or threatened force—or manufactured crises that made use of military pressure possible without risking total war before Germany was ready.

## Key steps in 1935–38: crises, opportunities and growing confidence
Between 1935 and 1938 a sequence of events transformed the international balance and increased the likelihood of war. In 1935 Germany staged the Saar plebiscite and won a peaceful return of the territory, gaining prestige. The same year, Hitler openly reintroduced conscription and announced rearmament; the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 gave nominal British approval to German naval expansion, undermining Versailles and encouraging further German assertiveness. In March 1936 German troops re-entered the Rhineland, violating Versailles and the Locarno Treaties; French and British reluctance to act confirmed the risks of defending the post‑1919 order. Germany’s involvement in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) provided a testing ground for new weapons and international partnerships, and the Rome–Berlin Axis of 1936 linked Germany to Mussolini’s Italy. In March 1938 Hitler engineered Anschluss, the annexation of Austria, cleverly combining internal pressure and the threat of force; the lack of effective international resistance again rewarded aggression. The Sudeten crisis of 1938 raised tensions to a new peak: Hitler demanded the German-speaking borderlands of Czechoslovakia, using claims of mistreatment as a pretext. The Munich Agreement of September 1938—where Britain, France and Italy agreed that Germany should take the Sudetenland—became the symbol of appeasement. It removed one buffer state and demonstrated that territorial revision achieved by threat could bring rewards without immediate conflict.

## From Munich to war: the collapse of restraint, 1939
Munich did not satisfy Hitler’s objectives. In March 1939 German forces occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia, proving that his ambitions went beyond reuniting German speakers and that appeasement had limits. The dismantling of Czechoslovakia convinced Britain that further concessions would risk larger war, and in March 1939 Britain guaranteed Poland’s independence. Hitler, not yet ready for a general European war, faced a strategic problem: Poland would not accept German demands over Danzig and the Polish Corridor, and Britain and France were now committed to oppose further aggression. To secure freedom of action in the east and to neutralise the Soviet threat, Hitler negotiated the Nazi–Soviet Pact in August 1939. This non‑aggression treaty included secret protocols dividing Poland and much of Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres. With that pact in place, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September, marking the official start of the Second World War in Europe.

## Why appeasement happened and why it failed
Appeasement must be understood in context. British and French leaders remembered the horror of 1914–18 and feared another catastrophic war. Both economies were weakened by the Depression and rearmament required time and consensus at home. Many politicians and public figures also thought that Versailles had been too harsh and that some German demands were legitimate. Chamberlain’s policy combined a desire to buy time for rearmament with a belief that reasonable concessions might stabilise Europe. However, appeasement misread Hitler’s intentions and underestimated how each successful demand increased his appetite and power. The League of Nations proved unable to enforce collective security; its failures in Manchuria and Abyssinia diminished confidence in collective responses. The result was that appeasement removed obstacles to German expansion and convinced Hitler that the Western powers lacked the will to stop him until a point was reached at which war became inevitable.

## Making the judgement: how far was Hitler to blame?
In answering whether Hitler was to blame for war in Europe in 1939, students should balance structural and individual explanations. On one hand, Hitler’s aims, ideology and deliberate policies—rearmament, willingness to use force, and diplomatic skill in exploiting divisions—were central. His choices turned grievances into expansion and made war a means to political ends. On the other hand, the international system mattered. The punitive elements of the Treaty of Versailles created widespread resentment on which Hitler capitalised; the economic shocks of the 1930s hardened national priorities; and the failure of collective security, plus British and French appeasement, made military revision cheaper and less risky. A sound answer argues that Hitler was the primary cause because his decisions and objectives set the direction and tempo of events, but that he was assisted by the mistakes and weaknesses of other states and by longer-term structural problems. Strong answers will show how these factors interacted rather than presenting them as separate, competing explanations.

## Exam technique
When answering Cambridge IGCSE questions on Hitler’s foreign policy, read the question carefully and note command words such as “explain”, “assess” or “how far”. For a “describe” or part (a) question, give accurate chronologies and key facts in a concise account. For “explain” and “assess” questions you must go beyond description: organise each paragraph around a clear point linked to the question, provide specific evidence (for example dates, events like the Rhineland, Anschluss, Munich and the Nazi–Soviet Pact), and explain why the evidence supports your point. For “how far” questions structure your answer as a debate: set out arguments that support the proposition, then present counter‑arguments, and finish with a judgement that weighs the evidence. Use topic sentences to signpost your argument and end with a conclusion that directly answers the question.

In Paper 1 essays practise writing a clear introduction that defines the scope of your answer and signals the factors you will analyse. Avoid narrative drift; keep linking material back to the question. Time management is crucial: allow around 40 minutes for each long essay in a two‑hour paper. For Paper 2 source questions, treat each source as evidence to be interrogated. Identify the source’s origin, purpose, content and limitations, and combine these evaluations with your own knowledge to reach balanced judgements. Remember that AO1 (knowledge) and AO2/AO3 (analysis and use of sources) are both important: combine precise facts with explanation and source evaluation.

Practice past questions under timed conditions, plan answers briefly before writing, and aim for clarity and balance. Use key examples from 1935–39 to support points, and always conclude with a direct answer to the question that shows how the factors you discussed combine to explain the outbreak of war.
