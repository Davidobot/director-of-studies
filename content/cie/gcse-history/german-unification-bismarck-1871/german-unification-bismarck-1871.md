# German unification and Bismarck (to 1871) (GCSE History Cambridge International)

## Introduction: Germany before unification
In the early nineteenth century what we now call Germany was not a single country but a patchwork of about 300 states ranging from large powers such as Prussia and Austria to tiny principalities and free cities. The Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna (1815) reshaped the map, creating the German Confederation, a loose association dominated by Austria. During the first half of the century two powerful ideas grew: liberalism, which wanted constitutional government and greater political freedom, and nationalism, which sought to unite German-speaking peoples into one nation. Economic change also mattered. The Zollverein, a customs union led by Prussia from 1834, simplified trade between many German states and helped knit parts of the region together economically. Despite these unifying forces, political division remained: rulers feared losing power, and Austria and Prussia competed for dominance. Understanding why Germany did not unite earlier, and how it eventually did so under Prussian leadership, is central to this topic.

## The failed revolutions of 1848 and their significance
The revolutions of 1848 across the German states were driven by a mixture of liberal, nationalist and social demands: calls for constitutions, free press, national unity and relief from economic hardship. In many cities mass protests forced rulers to promise reforms and to call representative assemblies. The Frankfurt Parliament met in 1848 with the aim of creating a unified Germany with a constitution. It debated whether a united Germany should include Austria (the Grossdeutsch solution) or exclude Austria and be led by Prussia (the Kleindeutsch solution). The revolutionaries’ reliance on moral persuasion and parliamentary debate clashed with the real power of monarchs and armies. Prussia’s King Frederick William IV rejected the imperial crown offered by the Frankfurt Parliament, and conservative forces regained control. The revolutions failed to achieve immediate political change, but their impact was important in other ways. They spread national ideas, showed the limits of liberalism without broad social support or military backing, and left a legacy of demands that later leaders—most importantly Otto von Bismarck—would exploit in different, more authoritarian ways to achieve unification.

## Economic, social and institutional foundations for unification
Unification was not achieved by military action alone; deeper economic and social trends set the stage. The Zollverein removed tariff barriers between many German states and promoted economic interdependence, industrial growth and market integration. Railways and industrial capital helped create a sense of shared economic destiny, especially under Prussian leadership. Prussia itself changed in important ways during the 1850s and 1860s. Following the failures of 1848, conservative reformers in Prussia carried out administrative, legal and military reforms which strengthened the central state. Military reform was particularly significant: under the leadership of Minister of War Albrecht von Roon and Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke, the Prussian army was reorganised, trained, and equipped with improved technology and mobilised with an effective system of general staff planning. These institutional strengths meant Prussia could project power more effectively than many other German states. At the same time, popular nationalist sentiment—though not uniformly liberal—created a receptive public mood for unification under a strong German power rather than through liberal parliamentary means.

## Otto von Bismarck: aims, character and methods
Otto von Bismarck became Prussia’s Minister-President in 1862 and remained the key architect of unification. A conservative Junker from Prussia’s landed aristocracy, Bismarck distrusted liberalism and parliamentary constraint but believed in the importance of the nation-state. He famously declared that “the great questions of the day will not be resolved by speeches and majority decisions—that was the mistake of 1848—but by blood and iron.” His approach, known as Realpolitik, emphasised practical, sometimes ruthless use of power and diplomacy to achieve objectives. Bismarck combined opportunistic diplomacy with careful calculation. He sought to strengthen Prussia, isolate potential enemies, and create situations in which war would have a limited, decisive purpose that advanced Prussian dominance. Importantly, Bismarck did not act alone. He relied on King Wilhelm I’s willingness to use force, on military leaders such as Moltke, and on the administrative and military reforms that had prepared Prussia for conflict. Bismarck’s skill lay in turning political crises into advantages, using alliances and manipulating events so that Prussia appeared to be acting defensively while in fact driving the process of unification.

## The wars of unification, 1864–1871
The practical process of unifying Germany under Prussia came through three quick, connected wars. The first conflict, in 1864, arose over the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Denmark tried to incorporate Schleswig, provoking protest from German nationalists. Bismarck negotiated an alliance with Austria; together Prussia and Austria defeated Denmark and occupied the duchies, but disputes over their administration provided Bismarck with the pretext to move against Austria itself.

Tensions culminated in the Austro–Prussian War of 1866. Bismarck deliberately alienated Austria diplomatically, securing neutrality or support from other powers such as Italy and several German states. The conflict was short but decisive. Prussia’s modernised army, directed by Moltke, won a crucial victory at Königgrätz (Sadowa) in July 1866. The result was the defeat of Austrian influence in northern Germany. In the peace settlement, arranged by Bismarck, Prussia excluded Austria from German affairs and created the North German Confederation, a Prussian-dominated union of northern states. Crucially, Bismarck gave generous peace terms to the southern German states, avoiding harsher terms that might have provoked long-term hostility.

The final step was the Franco–Prussian War of 1870–71. Bismarck engineered a diplomatic crisis over the Spanish succession when a Hohenzollern prince was proposed for the Spanish throne. France, fearing encirclement, demanded guarantees and was offended by the edited version of a dispatch from King Wilhelm I that Bismarck released to the press—the Ems Dispatch—which inflamed public opinion on both sides. France declared war. The southern German states, bound by defensive treaties with Prussia, rallied to the Prussian cause. Prussia and the German states achieved a rapid string of victories; the capture of Napoleon III at the Battle of Sedan in September 1870 shattered French resistance. The siege of Paris and French surrender followed, and in the victorious mood the German princes proclaimed Wilhelm I as German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles on 18 January 1871. Military success, diplomatic skill and nationalist enthusiasm combined to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership.

## The creation of the German Empire and immediate consequences
The proclamation of the Kaiser at Versailles symbolised the new balance of power in Europe. The German Empire, dominated by Prussia, unified most German-speaking territories (Austria remained outside). The new state combined authoritarian political structures with modern industrial strength. For many Germans the achievement fulfilled nationalist aspirations, but for liberals it was ambiguous: unification had been achieved without a widespread liberal revolution and power rested with the Kaiser, the Chancellor (Bismarck), the conservative Junkers and a strong bureaucracy and army. Internationally, unification shifted the European balance. Austria’s influence was curtailed in Germany and Italy completed its own unification process, while France experienced humiliation and political instability that shaped future Franco–German rivalry. Economically, the larger market and rapid industrialisation helped Germany become a leading European power. Debates about responsibility for unification have continued: historians assess the relative importance of Bismarck’s decisions, Prussian military strength, economic forces, and the weaknesses of rival states such as Austria and France.

## Interpreting Bismarck’s responsibility and other factors
How far Bismarck was responsible for German unification is one of the central interpretative questions. It is fair to argue that Bismarck was indispensable: his determination to use force when needed, his diplomatic skill in isolating Austria and provoking France at the right moment, and his ability to control the domestic political situation made unification under Prussia possible. Yet this does not mean he acted alone. Prussia’s economic advantages, military reforms and efficient administration created the conditions in which Bismarck’s plans could succeed. The weaknesses and mistakes of others mattered too: Austria’s rigid multi-national empire limited its capacity to lead a Germannation-state; France’s misjudgements—particularly over the Ems Dispatch and Napoleon III’s decision to go to war—provided Bismarck with a final opportunity to unite Germany decisively. Popular nationalism also played a role: the enthusiasm of many Germans for a united state helped draw reluctant southern states into the conflict with France. A balanced interpretation recognises Bismarck as the chief architect who made skilful use of deeper structural forces and contingent opportunities.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about German unification and Bismarck, begin with a clear introduction that sets out your argument and indicates the factors you will consider. In longer essay questions, devote a paragraph to each main factor—such as the role of Bismarck, Prussian military reforms, economic integration via the Zollverein, and the failures of Austria and France—explaining how each contributed and giving specific evidence, for example dates, battles (Königgrätz, Sedan), treaties (Prague 1866), and key personalities (Bismarck, Moltke, Wilhelm I). Always link evidence back to the question: explain why each factor matters and judge its relative importance. Use precise examples and short quotations, where helpful, but avoid narrative that does not address the question. In shorter source-based questions, analyse both the content and the origin of each source: consider the author’s purpose, audience and reliability, and compare sources to build a balanced judgement. Time management is vital: allocate time to planning, writing and reviewing, and finish with a concise conclusion that weighs the arguments and gives a reasoned judgement. Practising past questions and timing yourself will build confidence. Keep answers focused, use specific factual detail, and remember that examiners reward clear argument, accurate knowledge (AO1), and thoughtful explanation and evaluation (AO2 and AO3).
