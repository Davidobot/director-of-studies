# League of Nations: successes and failures (GCSE History Cambridge International)

## Introduction: what the League was supposed to do
The League of Nations was created after the First World War with the central aim of preventing another global conflict. It was meant to provide a forum where states could settle disputes peacefully, enforce collective security, promote disarmament and coordinate international cooperation on humanitarian problems. For many people in the 1920s the League represented an ambitious attempt to civilise international relations: to move away from secret diplomacy and force, and towards arbitration, moral pressure and international law. However, from the start the League faced a difficult task. It had to manage the competing interests of victorious and defeated powers, work without the full participation of the United States, and operate in an era of rising nationalism and economic instability. Understanding how and why the League sometimes worked, and why it often failed, depends on looking at both its structure and the political context of the 1920s and 1930s.

## Structure, membership and the idea of collective security
The League’s machinery combined an Assembly of members, a smaller Council for urgent matters, a Permanent Secretariat of civil servants, the Permanent Court of International Justice and a range of specialised agencies and committees. Decisions in the Assembly and Council were meant to be backed by the principle of collective security: if one state broke the peace, others would respond together through moral pressure, economic sanctions or even military action. In practice this idea looked good on paper but proved hard to apply. The League’s effectiveness depended on the willingness of its largest members to act together. The absence of the United States from membership, the inconsistent commitment of Britain and France, and the later withdrawal or exclusion of other major powers undermined the authority the League needed to carry out collective security. Even when the League could agree on the need to act, the requirement for unanimous decisions often slowed or weakened responses.

## Early successes: diplomacy and dispute settlement in the 1920s
During the 1920s the League did achieve a number of notable successes in settling disputes and easing tensions between small or medium powers. The Aaland Islands case between Finland and Sweden in 1920–21 is a good example of the League working as intended: a peaceful investigation and a decision that satisfied both sides by awarding the islands to Finland while guaranteeing demilitarisation. The League also handled the Greek–Bulgarian crisis of 1925 effectively by condemning Greece for an invasion, securing a withdrawal of Greek troops and ordering compensation. These outcomes showed that, where the interests of the great powers were not deeply engaged and where moral pressure and arbitration were acceptable, the League could mediate successfully. Even in more complex episodes such as Corfu in 1923 and Vilna in 1920 the League’s involvement mattered, though with mixed results. The Corfu incident exposed limits to League power when a strong member like Italy used coercion; the League’s inability to impose its will there highlighted that successes often depended on the balance of force and political will beyond the Assembly hall.

## Humanitarian and technical achievements
One of the League’s most durable legacies was its work on humanitarian and technical problems. Agencies and commissions established or sponsored by the League tackled refugees, health, labour conditions and the suppression of slavery. The League’s High Commission for Refugees helped millions of displaced people after the war, creating travel documents and practical assistance, while the Health Organisation made advances against diseases, coordinated responses to epidemics and set early standards that later influenced worldwide public health efforts. The International Labour Organisation, although independent, worked closely with the League to improve working conditions and limit abuses. These activities were important because they produced real improvements in people’s lives and established international cooperation in areas that were not immediately political. For students of history, these achievements show that the League’s value cannot be judged only by whether it prevented wars.

## Weaknesses in organisation and membership
The League’s formal weaknesses were significant. The absence of the United States — despite President Wilson’s leading role in creating the League — deprived it of economic and military weight from the beginning. The requirement for unanimous decisions in the Council and Assembly made strong, rapid action difficult. There was no League army and no mechanism to compel powerful states to obey decisions; sanctions relied on members’ willingness to withhold trade and investment, and often excluded the non-members whose cooperation might be decisive. Membership was patchy and changed over time: Germany and the Soviet Union were initially excluded, later joined and then left or were expelled; Japan, Italy and Germany all withdrew in the 1930s as they pursued expansionist policies. These structural and membership problems meant that the League’s authority rested heavily on moral persuasion rather than enforceable power.

## The Manchurian and Abyssinian crises: turning points in the 1930s
The 1930s brought two crises that exposed the League’s practical limits. In 1931–32 Japan invaded Manchuria and set up a puppet state, and although the League’s Lytton Commission condemned the aggression and refused to recognise Manchukuo, the League had no means of reversing the occupation. Japan simply withdrew from the League in 1933. The Abyssinian crisis of 1935–36 was even more damaging to the League’s credibility. When Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia), the League condemned the attack and imposed limited economic sanctions, but crucial raw materials such as oil were omitted, enforcement was weak and Britain and France pursued secret talks to keep Mussolini on their side against Hitler. Italy completed its conquest and left the League in 1937. Both crises showed that when major powers chose aggression for their own reasons, the League could not prevent territorial expansion; moral condemnation and partial sanctions were insufficient without coordinated political will and military backing.

## Economic depression, great-power politics and why the League failed to keep the peace
The wider international context helps explain why the League faltered. The global economic depression of the 1930s heightened nationalism, protectionism and the appeal of authoritarian solutions. States became more focused on domestic survival and less willing to accept economic sacrifices for collective enforcement. At the same time, great-power politics returned: Britain and France, anxious about Germany and eager to protect their own interests, often preferred appeasement or bilateral agreements rather than risking confrontation through the League. Secret diplomacy and the desire to preserve empire or secure strategic alliances undermined the League’s principles. The rise of aggressive, revisionist states willing to break international law also exposed the League’s dependence on consensus. As a result, by the late 1930s the League had lost the authority and membership necessary to perform its core function of collective security.

## Assessing overall success: a balanced judgement
Judging the League of Nations requires a balanced view. In the 1920s its achievements in settling minor disputes and advancing humanitarian, health and labour standards were genuine and important. It provided a new diplomatic vocabulary and institutions for international cooperation that influenced later organisations, including the United Nations. However, its failures in the 1930s to prevent large-scale aggression by Japan, Italy and Germany reveal that the League lacked the mechanisms and political support needed to control major powers. For a GCSE answer, the strongest conclusion recognises this duality: the League was successful in limited, peaceful contexts and in social and humanitarian reform, but it failed in its central aim to stop major acts of aggression and thus to preserve collective security. The balance of evidence suggests that structural weaknesses, the refusal of key powers to commit fully, the economic crisis and the rise of dictators made large-scale failure increasingly likely.

## Legacy and significance for the post‑war world
Although the League collapsed as an effective guarantor of peace before the Second World War, its legacy shaped the post-war settlement. The failures of the 1930s taught political leaders the dangers of relying on moral persuasion without enforcement. When the United Nations was designed after 1945, planners tried to remedy some League weaknesses by creating a Security Council with the permanent great powers and clearer arrangements for enforcement, while retaining specialised agencies for health, refugees and labour that built on League experience. For historians, the League remains a crucial example of the limits of internationalism when confronted by nationalism, economic crisis and great-power rivalry, and a reminder that international organisations can make important humanitarian contributions even when they cannot prevent war.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about the League of Nations, begin by making clear what aspect you will judge: its peacekeeping, its humanitarian work, or its overall success. Use specific case studies such as the Aaland Islands, Bulgaria, Vilna, Corfu, the Manchurian crisis and the Abyssinian crisis to support your points, giving dates and outcomes where possible. Explain why each example counts as a success or a failure and link each example back to your argument about structural causes: membership, the unanimity rule, lack of armed forces, and the impact of the Depression and great‑power politics. A strong answer balances knowledge (AO1) with explanation and analysis (AO2): do not only list events, but explain why they happened and how they reveal the League’s strengths or weaknesses. If the question involves sources, remember to evaluate their origin, purpose and content and to use your own knowledge to confirm, qualify or challenge what the sources say (AO3). Structure your response with a brief introduction that outlines your judgement, clear paragraphs that develop evidence and analysis, and a concise conclusion that weighs the evidence and reaches a reasoned verdict. Finally, practise timed essays using past question styles so you can apply specific examples under exam conditions and show full command of the topic.
