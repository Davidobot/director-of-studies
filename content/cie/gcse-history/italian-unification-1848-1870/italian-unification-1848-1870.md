# Italian unification (1848–1870) (GCSE History Cambridge International)

## Italy before unification: states, powers and ideas
In the mid‑19th century the Italian peninsula was a patchwork of separate states: the Kingdom of Sardinia–Piedmont in the northwest, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the south, the Papal States in central Italy under the Pope, Tuscany, Parma and Modena as smaller duchies, and Lombardy–Venetia under Austrian control. Economically and socially these areas differed greatly: the north was more industrialising and commercially linked to Europe, while the south remained largely rural and traditional. Two major forces shaped the idea of a single Italy. Liberalism offered constitutional government, legal reform and economic modernisation; nationalism provided the language and emotional appeal of a united nation with a common history and culture. These ideas found expression in secret societies, newspapers and political movements, most notably Giuseppe Mazzini’s Young Italy, which promoted republican and popular revolution. At the same time conservative forces—monarchies, the Catholic Church and foreign powers (particularly Austria and, to a lesser extent, France and the Holy See)—defended the status quo. Understanding this fragmented political map and competing aims is essential for explaining why unification took more than two decades and why it combined popular action with state diplomacy.

## The revolutions of 1848–49: causes, events and failure
The revolutions of 1848 across Europe reached Italy in the form of uprisings in Milan, Venice, Rome and other cities. Causes included economic distress, demand for constitutional government, and the spread of nationalist ideas. In Lombardy and Venetia Italians rose against Austrian rule; in the Papal States and elsewhere liberals demanded constitutions and reforms. In 1849 a short‑lived Roman Republic was proclaimed under Mazzini and Garibaldi, and in the north Piedmont briefly went to war with Austria. Despite initial successes, most 1848–49 revolts failed. Reasons for failure included a lack of coordination between different regions and social groups, the military strength of conservative rulers, and crucial foreign intervention: Austrian armies crushed revolts in the north, while French troops restored papal rule in Rome. The revolutions, however, were important because they spread nationalist sentiment, exposed the weaknesses of the ancien régime, and clarified the limits of purely popular revolution. They set the scene for a new phase in which a more pragmatic, state‑led strategy would dominate.

## Key men and movements: Mazzini, Garibaldi, Cavour and Victor Emmanuel II
Italian unification is often told through its leading personalities, each representing different routes to unity. Giuseppe Mazzini was the ideologue of republican nationalism and grassroots insurrection; his Young Italy inspired many volunteers and kept the idea of a united republic alive. Giuseppe Garibaldi was the charismatic popular military leader whose red‑shirt volunteers symbolised the revolutionary, democratic strand of unification; his campaigns had mass appeal in the south and among peasants and artisans. Count Camillo di Cavour, Prime Minister of Piedmont‑Sardinia, represented the liberal monarchist and diplomatic approach. A realist and moderniser, Cavour aimed to expand Piedmont’s power and use foreign alliances to drive out Austria, while protecting the kingdom’s constitutional monarchy (the Statuto Albertino of 1848). King Victor Emmanuel II provided the royal legitimacy that Cavour needed: as monarch of Piedmont he became the figurehead of a united Italy under a king rather than a republic. These four actors often had competing aims—Mazzini and Garibaldi favoured popular republicanism, Cavour a conservative liberal monarchy—but their interactions and rivalries shaped the sequence of events that led to unification.

## Cavour and diplomacy: Plombières, war with Austria and the northern gains
From the 1850s Cavour pursued a strategy of modernization at home and tactical diplomacy abroad to strengthen Piedmont‑Sardinia as the nucleus of a future Italy. He reformed the economy, encouraged railways and banking, and built an efficient army. Crucially, Cavour negotiated secretly with Napoleon III of France at Plombières in 1858. The agreement envisaged French support against Austria in return for Savoy and Nice. War came in 1859 when Austria tried to reassert control over Lombardy. The Franco‑Piedmontese armies won important battles at Magenta and Solferino, forcing Austria to surrender Lombardy. The brutality witnessed at Solferino helped prompt humanitarian responses in Europe, but politically the outcome was mixed: Napoleon III, alarmed by the scale of the conflict and by Prussian reactions, made a sudden peace with Austria at Villafranca, without fully consulting Cavour. Lombardy passed to Piedmont, but Venetia remained Austrian and further complications followed. Cavour resigned briefly in anger but returned to manage the complex process of annexation. Meanwhile plebiscites in central Italian duchies and Tuscany resulted in their union with Piedmont. Cavour’s use of diplomacy and limited war demonstrates the “from above” element in unification: statecraft, alliances and international bargaining were indispensable.

## Garibaldi, the south and the popular dimension: the Expedition of the Thousand
While Cavour worked through diplomacy, Garibaldi provided the decisive popular military push in the south. In 1860 Garibaldi landed in Sicily with the “Thousand” volunteers and won remarkable support from peasants and local elites weary of Bourbon misrule. His guerrilla tactics, charisma and promise of liberation led to the rapid collapse of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Garibaldi’s victories culminated in the capture of Naples, and in a dramatic political moment at Teano he handed his conquests over to King Victor Emmanuel II, accepting the monarchy as the vehicle for national unity. Cavour had been anxious about Garibaldi’s republicanism and had even intervened to ensure Piedmontese troops occupied key territories to secure orderly annexation. The annexation was then confirmed by plebiscite, and in 1861 the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel as king, even though important areas like Venetia and Rome remained outside. Garibaldi’s campaign illustrates the “from below” force of popular mobilization: volunteers, local uprisings and social grievances played a vital role, yet the outcome depended on coordination with state interests.

## Completion of unification, 1866–1870: Venetia and Rome
Two final events completed Italian unification. In 1866 Italy allied with Prussia during the Austro‑Prussian War, hoping to gain Venetia. Although the Italian army had mixed military performance, Prussia’s victory forced Austria to cede Venetia. The territory was handed to France and then to Italy after diplomatic transfers and plebiscites, extending Italy’s control to the northeast. The final and most sensitive step was Rome. Protected by French troops because Napoleon III did not want to antagonise Catholics in France, the Papal States persisted. The outbreak of the Franco‑Prussian War in 1870 required Napoleon to withdraw his garrison from Rome. Italian troops entered the city after the breach at Porta Pia on 20 September 1870, and Rome was annexed. In 1871 Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy (having moved from Turin to Florence temporarily in 1865). The capture of Rome resolved the territorial unification of the peninsula, but it left the “Roman Question”: the Pope rejected the annexation and considered himself a prisoner in the Vatican, a dispute not resolved until the Lateran Treaty of 1929.

## Consequences and significance: political settlement and regional challenges
Italian unification created a single state where none had existed for centuries, but unity was uneven and incomplete in social terms. Politically, the new state established a constitutional monarchy dominated by Piedmontese institutions and elites. The regime was liberal in legal and economic reforms but limited in political participation; the franchise remained restricted for some time. Economically, northern regions began industrialising while the south lagged, producing long‑term regional disparities and social problems such as brigandage in the south and mass emigration later in the century. The Church’s hostility to the new state influenced Italian politics and society: many Catholics refused to participate in the political system until the Church’s stance softened. Internationally, unification altered the balance of power in Europe: Austria lost influence in Italy, France gained territory (Savoy and Nice) and later faced the political cost of Napoleonic intervention, while Prussia emerged as a dominant partner in the German unification story. Historians debate whether unification was mainly “from above” (Cavour, the Piedmontese state) or “from below” (Mazzini, Garibaldi and popular movements). The best interpretation recognises that both diplomacy and popular action were essential: state power provided the framework and legitimacy, while volunteers and uprisings supplied momentum and popular legitimacy.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Italian unification, begin with a clear statement that directly addresses the question, then use a chronological framework to structure your argument while combining thematic points where appropriate. For “how far” or “to what extent” questions, balance the answer by giving weight to both sides of the argument: explain Cavour’s diplomatic and institutional achievements and contrast these with Garibaldi’s and Mazzini’s popular contributions, assessing which factors were decisive. Use named evidence: mention Plombières (1858), the battles of Magenta and Solferino (1859), the Villafranca outcome, the Expedition of the Thousand (1860), the transfer of Venetia (1866) and the capture of Rome (1870). Explain the roles of foreign powers—France, Austria and Prussia—and show how international events like the Franco‑Prussian War influenced Italian outcomes. For evaluation, consider consequences as well as causes: the nature of the new Italian state, regional divisions and the Roman Question are strong concluding points. If asked to use sources, always consider origin, purpose, content and tone: who produced the source, why, and how does that affect its reliability about events such as Garibaldi’s popularity or Cavour’s diplomacy? Finally, plan your time: allow a short planning paragraph, develop two or three well‑supported analytical paragraphs, and finish with a concise conclusion that answers the question directly and weighs the evidence.
