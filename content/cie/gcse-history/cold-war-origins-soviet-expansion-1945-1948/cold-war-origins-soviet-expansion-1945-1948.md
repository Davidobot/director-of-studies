# Origins of the Cold War and Soviet expansion (1945–48) (GCSE History Cambridge International)

## The wartime alliance and the root causes of post‑war tension
During the Second World War the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain were allies of necessity against Nazi Germany. That alliance masked deep differences. The USSR had suffered catastrophic human and material losses and wanted a post‑war Europe that would prevent another invasion; the United States and Britain believed in the restoration of independent states and open markets. By 1945 these conflicting priorities had already produced disagreements about how liberated countries would be governed. The wartime conferences at Yalta (February 1945) and Potsdam (July–August 1945) show both cooperation and friction. Leaders agreed on broad principles — for example, that Germany should be demilitarised and Europe rebuilt — but left crucial matters vague: what counted as Soviet security, how far self‑determination would be allowed, and how far the defeated states should pay reparations. The American decision to use the atomic bomb in August 1945 also changed the balance of power and deepened Soviet suspicions; even though the bomb was primarily a weapon to end the war with Japan, it became a bargaining chip in the emerging rivalry. These political, ideological and security differences set the scene for a rapid breakdown of the wartime partnership once the common enemy was defeated.

## Methods of Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe, 1945–48
By the end of the war the Red Army occupied much of Eastern and Central Europe. This military presence gave the Soviet leadership practical power to shape post‑war politics. The USSR used a mixture of methods to extend its control: backing local communist parties, organising coalition governments that gradually excluded opponents, manipulating elections, intimidating or removing leaders regarded as insufficiently pro‑Soviet, and setting up security services to suppress dissent. In Poland the imposition of a pro‑Soviet government after 1945 led many Poles to see the end of the war as the beginning of foreign domination rather than liberation. Romania, Bulgaria and Albania moved quickly into Soviet‑style political systems. Hungary and Yugoslavia followed different trajectories: Hungary saw increasing control by communists culminating in the arrest and marginalisation of rivals, while Yugoslavia under Tito initially resisted complete Soviet control, causing a split with Moscow in 1948. Czechoslovakia remained more pluralistic until the coup of February 1948, when non‑communist ministers resigned and were replaced, completing Communist domination. These events were often explained in the Soviet Union as necessary security measures; to the United States and many in Western Europe they looked like a deliberate Soviet plan to expand influence and export communism.

## American reactions: from goodwill to containment
US policymakers interpreted Soviet actions as expansionist. The language of diplomacy shifted quickly from wartime cooperation to suspicion and containment. In 1947 President Truman and his advisers introduced policies aimed at preventing further spread of Soviet influence. The Truman Doctrine presented American support for countries resisting “subjugation” by armed minorities or foreign pressures; it was first applied in Greece and Turkey where communist movements were active. The Marshall Plan, announced in 1947, combined generosity and strategy: vast economic aid to rebuild European economies would stabilise governments and reduce the appeal of communism. Both measures signalled a new US approach — active engagement and the use of economic and political tools to limit Soviet power. American opinion was shaped by reports from diplomats and journalists as well as by fears that poor, unstable states would turn to Moscow. At the same time, some in the US government worried that economic integration of Western Europe might be impossible unless the United States took the lead in providing resources and markets. The combination of economic assistance and the public rhetoric of containment hardened the division between East and West.

## Germany and the Berlin crisis: the most visible flashpoint
Germany and Berlin were focal points of the struggle. The country was divided into occupation zones controlled by the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union. Initially agreed as temporary arrangements, disagreements over reparations, political future and economic recovery made the divisions permanent. In 1948 the Western powers moved towards economic recovery in their zones, introducing a new currency in June 1948 and creating Trizonia (the merger of the American, British and French zones). The Soviets saw these moves as undermining their influence and in response imposed the Berlin Blockade in June 1948, sealing off road, rail and canal links to West Berlin in an attempt to force the Western powers out of the city. The Western response was the Berlin Airlift, an unprecedented logistical operation that supplied the city by air for almost a year. The success of the airlift humiliated Soviet attempts to use coercion and demonstrated Western resolve; the blockade was lifted in May 1949. The crisis crystallised the new division of Europe and pushed the United States and its European allies towards a formal military alliance. For many contemporaries and later historians the Berlin Blockade marks a clear turning point from wartime cooperation to open Cold War confrontation.

## The emergence of opposing military blocs and longer‑term consequences
The Berlin crisis helped persuade Western governments that collective defence was necessary. In 1949 the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) was created as a formal military alliance to deter Soviet aggression in Western Europe. The Soviet response was to deepen political control in its satellite states and later to create a military counter‑alliance, the Warsaw Pact (established in 1955), but the pattern of blocs was already fixed by 1948–49. The origins of the Cold War therefore combined immediate post‑war disputes over strategy and territory with longer‑term institutional responses: alliances, military planning and an ideological struggle that would shape global politics for decades. The breakdown of cooperation also accelerated an arms race and competition for influence in regions outside Europe — Asia, the Middle East and, later, Latin America — where the superpowers engaged in proxy conflicts rather than direct war.

## Assessing blame: interpretations and how to weigh the evidence
When questions ask “who was to blame for the Cold War?” it helps to weigh the evidence on different sides and to recognise that simple answers are usually incomplete. One long‑standing interpretation blames the Soviet Union: historians who take this view point to Soviet expansion, the creation of single‑party regimes in Eastern Europe, and the use of intimidation and policing to remove opposition. This view emphasises ideology and Soviet aims for security through buffer zones. A contrasting interpretation, prominent among revisionist historians in the mid‑20th century, shifts part of the responsibility to the United States, arguing that American economic and strategic policies sought to maintain global markets and were seen by the USSR as a threat; the Marshall Plan and the rapid promotion of Western institutions are cited as confirming US priorities. A more balanced, “post‑revisionist” account suggests that mutual misunderstandings, security dilemmas and structural conditions — such as the power vacuum in war‑torn Europe and the rapid demobilisation of armies — created a situation in which both sides took measures that the other interpreted as hostile. For example, Soviet leaders’ memory of 1918–41 led them to prioritize security even at the cost of local autonomy, while American policymakers perceived any Soviet sphere as a threat to free institutions and markets. In practice, responsibility is shared: Soviet actions created the conditions for American policies of containment, and American responses convinced the USSR that containment was a genuine threat. Good exam answers show awareness of these competing explanations, use specific evidence from 1945–48, and explain how each action produced a reaction.

## Key events and their significance, 1945–48
Between the final months of World War II and the end of the 1940s several events stand out as decisive in moving Europe from alliance into rivalry. The Yalta and Potsdam conferences negotiated the shape of post‑war Europe but left ambiguity over key issues. The Red Army’s occupation of Eastern Europe allowed Moscow to shape political outcomes across the region, using both coercion and legal‑political measures. The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan signalled a new American willingness to intervene economically and politically to contain communism. The currency reform in the Western zones of Germany and the subsequent Berlin Blockade forced an urgent test of wills, and the Berlin Airlift’s success underlined the limitation of Soviet coercion. These incidents are connected: the power vacuum after the war, competing security priorities, ideological conflict and rapid diplomatic moves combined to create a divided Europe. For students it is important to link specific events to broader causes and consequences, showing not only what happened but why it mattered for the longer Cold War.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the origins of the Cold War, start by identifying the command word and planning a clear argument. For “how far” or “to what extent” questions, consider both sides of the argument and make a judgement that is supported by evidence. Use specific examples from 1945–48 (for example Yalta/Potsdam, Soviet actions in Poland and Czechoslovakia, the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the currency reform, the Berlin Blockade and the airlift) to support each point. Explain how one event led to another — for instance, how Soviet control of Eastern Europe helped prompt the Marshall Plan, or how currency reform led to the Berlin Blockade — because the ability to show cause and consequence is rewarded. If a question involves sources, assess provenance as well as content: consider who produced a source, why and when, and how that affects what it says; compare sources to see where they agree or contradict and use your contextual knowledge to evaluate their reliability. Structure essays with a short introduction that sets out your argument, several paragraphs that develop evidence and analysis, and a conclusion that makes a balanced judgement. Time management matters: for a two‑hour paper divide time so you can plan, write and revise each answer. Finally, practice writing concise explanations that link facts to interpretations — examiners look for clear reasoning as much as accurate knowledge.
