# 19th-century imperialism: motives and impacts (GCSE History Cambridge International)

## Introduction: what we mean by imperialism and why the 19th century matters
In the nineteenth century European states and the United States expanded their control over large parts of Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Caribbean. This process is often called imperialism: the policy of extending a country’s power and influence through colonisation, economic domination or military force. Colonialism is one specific form of imperialism in which territory is directly occupied and governed. The era matters because rapid industrialisation, new technologies, changing ideas about race and civilisation, and growing international rivalries combined to produce a scale and intensity of overseas expansion not seen before. Understanding the motives and impacts of 19th‑century imperialism helps explain later developments in the twentieth century, including the rise of independence movements and the reshaping of global politics.

## Motives for empire: why nations wanted colonies
Imperial expansion was driven by a mixture of economic, political, military and ideological motives that often reinforced each other. Economically, industrialised powers wanted raw materials such as cotton, rubber, oil and minerals, as well as new markets for manufactured goods and places to invest surplus capital. Politically and strategically, colonies provided naval bases, coaling stations and routes that protected trade and global influence; control of the Suez Canal and of island bases affected how quickly a navy could travel between home and empire. Military prestige and national rivalry also pushed governments to acquire territory: holding colonies became a sign of a great power. Ideologically, many Europeans believed in a “civilising mission”: the idea that Western civilisation, Christianity and modern institutions should be spread to “backward” peoples. This view was often supported by Social Darwinist thinking, which used a distorted version of evolutionary ideas to suggest that stronger nations had a right, or even duty, to dominate weaker ones. Missionary societies played their part by seeking converts and building schools and hospitals, tying religious purpose to imperial expansion. Finally, technological developments—steamships, railways, the telegraph, more effective firearms and a medical advance against diseases like malaria—made distant conquest and administration far easier than before.

## How empires were built and the styles of rule used
Imperial control could take many forms. Some powers used direct rule, replacing indigenous leaders with their own administrators and laws; France favoured this model in many places and promoted cultural assimilation. Other powers relied on indirect rule, governing through local rulers who retained some authority while answering to colonial officials; Britain often used this approach in larger, more diverse territories. Chartered companies and private firms acted as imperial agents early in the century: the British East India Company is the best example of a commercial organisation that ruled large territories before formal imperial control was established. Protectorates and treaties allowed powers to claim influence without full annexation, and settler colonies—where large numbers of Europeans settled permanently—produced different social and economic structures from colonies primarily exploited for resources. The “Scramble for Africa” of the late nineteenth century saw European states formalise their claims through diplomacy and conferences, most famously the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, which set rules for claiming African territory and helped accelerate partition of the continent.

## Case study: French, British and Belgian models in Africa
Comparing French, British and Belgian imperialism in Africa shows how motives and methods produced different impacts. In Senegal the French pursued a policy of assimilation in which they attempted to replace local legal systems and culture with French language, law and institutions. French administrators believed they were bringing civilisation, but their policies often broke local structures and favoured those Africans who adopted French ways. In Nigeria, British rule under administrators such as Frederick Lugard developed the model of indirect rule: existing kings and chiefs remained in office but were integrated into a colonial administrative hierarchy to collect taxes and maintain order. Indirect rule preserved some traditional structures but also empowered selected groups at the expense of others and entrenched divisions that could outlast colonial rule. The Congo Free State under King Leopold II of Belgium shows one of the most brutal consequences of private and exploitative imperialism. Leopold’s regime extracted ivory and, later, rubber through forced labour, violent punishments and terror. Reports of widespread abuse, population decline and cruelty eventually caused an international outcry and led to the Belgian state taking over the territory, but the human and social cost had been catastrophic.

## Case study: the British in India and the Revolt of 1857
British expansion in India began through trade and the East India Company and ended with formal crown rule. Indian society was profoundly affected by the Company’s growing political and economic power, by changes in landholding and taxation, and by missionary and reformist interventions that challenged traditional practices. The Revolt of 1857 (often called the Indian Mutiny or the First War of Independence) brought these tensions to a head: it involved Indian soldiers (sepoys), rulers and sections of the population reacting against perceived threats to religion, property and status, as well as against harsh military discipline and economic grievances. The rebellion was suppressed, but its consequences were decisive. The British government abolished the East India Company and established direct rule under the British Crown (the Raj). Reforms followed: the administration was reorganised, the army was restructured to reduce the risk of future mutinies, and British officials adopted a more cautious approach to social reform. At the same time, political and cultural changes sowed seeds of modern Indian nationalism by creating new political classes, spreading Western education, and encouraging discussion about rights and representation.

## The United States, the Spanish–American War and overseas expansion
Late in the century the United States moved from continental expansion to overseas imperialism. The 1898 Spanish–American War resulted in a quick American victory over Spain and the Treaty of Paris, by which the United States took control of former Spanish possessions including the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico, while Cuba became a US protectorate in practice. Supporters of expansion claimed economic opportunity, strategic advantage across the Pacific and a mission to uplift and modernise. Opponents formed the Anti‑Imperialist League, arguing that imperial rule contradicted American ideals of self‑government and would entangle the United States in foreign problems. The most striking consequence was the Philippine–American War (1899–1902), a brutal conflict in which Filipino forces resisted US rule and were suppressed by American military campaigns. The US then established a colonial administration that introduced American education, legal reforms and infrastructure, but also imposed control that left deep resentments and set patterns for future nationalist movements.

## Impacts on colonised peoples and longer‑term legacies
The effects of imperialism on colonised societies were complex and uneven. Economically, colonial governments restructured local economies to serve metropolitan needs: land was converted to cash‑crop production, mining and plantations expanded, and local industries were often undermined by cheap imports. Infrastructure such as railways, ports and telegraphs was built, but primarily to extract resources and move troops rather than to benefit local populations. Socially and culturally, missionary schools and colonial education spread European ideas, languages and administrative skills, creating new elites who sometimes worked within the colonial system and sometimes led anti‑colonial movements. Traditional societies were disrupted: land loss, forced labour, taxation and new legal systems changed social relationships. Political consequences included the loss of sovereignty, the drawing of arbitrary borders that grouped different peoples together or split communities apart, and the creation of dependency on the imperial power. Resistance took many forms, from armed uprisings to legal protest and the formation of political organisations. A major long‑term legacy was the growth of nationalist movements in the twentieth century that drew on new political ideas and on the experience of colonial rule. The human cost was often immense: population decline from violence, disease and harsh labour regimes occurred in many places, and the social trauma of violence and dispossession could last generations.

## Imperialism and international politics: rivalry, diplomacy and conflict
Colonial expansion reshaped international relations. The contest for colonies became an aspect of great‑power rivalry, contributing to diplomatic tensions and competition for prestige. The race to control parts of Africa and Asia led to alliances, crises and a heightened sense of insecurity among the leading powers. Strategic interests—such as protecting sea routes and coaling stations—meant that imperial disputes could have implications for European security. While imperialism did not alone cause the First World War, colonial rivalries and the desire to protect overseas possessions were factors that increased mistrust and made diplomatic crises more dangerous. At the same time, imperial networks fostered cultural exchange, migration and the spread of ideas, so the international picture was one of conflict and connection.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about 19th‑century imperialism, always begin by defining the key terms the question uses and setting out the time and place you will discuss. Use specific examples to support your arguments: the French in Senegal, British rule and the Revolt of 1857 in India, Leopold II’s Congo and the US takeover of the Philippines are useful case studies that show how motives, methods and impacts differed. For “why” questions explain a range of causes and evaluate their relative importance rather than listing facts. For “what were the effects” or “with what consequences” questions, show variety: discuss economic, political, social and cultural impacts and be clear about who benefited and who suffered. Where a question asks “to what extent” or “how far,” present a balanced argument and reach a judged conclusion that weighs the evidence you have discussed. Organise your answer clearly with an introduction, developed paragraphs that each make one main point supported by evidence, and a conclusion that directly answers the question. Time management is essential: spend longer on higher‑mark parts, aim to include at least two well‑developed case studies, and remember to link specific evidence to the assessment objectives by explaining significance, change or continuity. Concluding sentences that assess overall impact and show awareness of longer‑term legacies will gain higher marks.
