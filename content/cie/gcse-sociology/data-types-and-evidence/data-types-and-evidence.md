# Data types and evidence (GCSE Sociology Cambridge International)

## What sociologists mean by data and evidence
In sociology, data and evidence are the raw materials used to study how people behave and how societies are organised. Data can be numbers that measure behaviour or written and spoken words that reveal meanings, motives and experiences. Evidence is data that has been collected and interpreted in a way that helps answer a sociological question. Throughout Cambridge IGCSE Sociology you will learn to recognise different kinds of data, to judge their strengths and weaknesses, and to use them to support arguments. Good sociology does not simply state facts; it interprets evidence in the light of theory and research methods, showing awareness of what the evidence can and cannot tell us about social life.

## Primary and secondary evidence: what they are and when to use them
Primary evidence is material that the researcher collects directly for the purpose of the study. Examples include questionnaires answered by pupils, interviews with parents, observations of classroom behaviour, and a school’s attendance records obtained for a specific research project. Primary data is powerful because the researcher controls how it is gathered and can design methods to match the research question. Secondary evidence, by contrast, already exists when the researcher begins their study. This includes official statistics such as census or crime figures, historical documents, newspaper articles, academic studies, and material from websites or social media. Secondary sources are useful when primary data would be too expensive or time-consuming to collect, and they can provide important background or longitudinal perspective. When you choose between primary and secondary evidence you need to weigh trade-offs: primary data can be tailored and highly relevant but may be limited in scale; secondary data can allow comparisons over time or across large populations but may not measure exactly what you need.

## Quantitative and qualitative data: features, uses and examples
Quantitative data are numerical and can be summarised with averages, percentages and graphs. A survey that asks 500 students whether they support school uniform yields quantitative data that lets us measure patterns and compare groups. Qualitative data are non‑numerical and seek depth of understanding. Interviews, focus groups, and open-ended survey responses produce words, stories and interpretations that reveal meanings, motives and context. Each type serves different sociological purposes: quantitative approaches are strong when you want to test hypotheses, identify correlations or make generalisations about trends; qualitative approaches are essential when you want to understand how people interpret their situations or why they behave as they do. Modern research often combines both kinds of data so that numbers can be supported by lived experience and meanings can be tested against broader patterns.

## Common types of secondary sources and how to read them critically
Official statistics, such as national educational attainment or police-recorded crime rates, are a central resource in sociology. They make large-scale comparison possible, but they are produced with specific definitions and procedures that affect what is counted. For example, crime statistics depend on reporting practices and recording rules, so they often understate the true level of offending (the “dark figure” of crime). Historical documents such as letters or government reports offer insight into past societies and help explain change over time, but they may reflect the perspective of particular groups. Media content and digital sources, including news articles, blogs and social media posts, are increasingly important as they reveal contemporary representations and public debates. However, media samples can be selective, sensationalist or subject to corporate ownership pressures. When you use secondary evidence, always ask who produced it, for what purpose, how it was collected and what limitations those facts impose on the conclusions you draw.

## Assessing the quality of evidence: validity, reliability, representativeness and bias
Not all evidence is equally useful. Validity asks whether a method actually measures what it claims to measure: if you want to study student motivation, ticking boxes about “liking school” may miss deeper reasons for engagement, whereas interviews may uncover underlying attitudes. Reliability refers to consistency: a reliable questionnaire would produce the same results if repeated under similar conditions. Representativeness concerns whether a sample reflects the wider population; a study of one classroom cannot automatically be generalised to all schools. Bias arises in many ways: interviewer bias, leading questions, sampling that excludes certain groups, or digital algorithms that privilege particular voices online. When you read statistics, look for ways the data could be skewed. When you plan research, think ahead about how to reduce bias—for example, by piloting questions, anonymising responses, or using random or stratified sampling where possible. Explaining these strengths and limitations in exam answers shows mature understanding of how evidence supports or undermines claims.

## Presenting and analysing data: turning numbers and text into sociological points
Being able to present evidence clearly is as important as collecting it. Quantitative data are often summarised with tables, bar charts, line graphs and pie charts; these visual forms make trends and comparisons easy to spot. However, graphs can mislead if scales are manipulated or percentages are presented without raw numbers. Qualitative data require careful analysis: coding themes from interview transcripts, summarising recurring ideas, and using illustrative quotations to support claims. In essays and exam answers you should move from description to interpretation: describe what the evidence shows, explain how it links to sociological concepts or theories, and evaluate how convincing it is. A good approach is to use a brief statistic or a short quote as evidence, then explain its sociological relevance and finally note any limits to its usefulness. This pattern – evidence, explanation, evaluation – maps neatly onto the assessment objectives for Cambridge IGCSE Sociology.

## Combining methods, time considerations and ethical responsibilities
Sociologists often combine methods to balance weaknesses in any single approach. Triangulation, where two or more methods or sources are used, increases confidence in findings because different kinds of evidence can confirm or challenge each other. Longitudinal studies, which collect data from the same people over time, are especially useful for studying change, though they require time and sustained resources. Any research involving people must address ethics: informed consent, respect for privacy, confidentiality, avoidance of harm and adherence to legal protections. Digital research raises particular ethical questions about using social media posts, as users may not expect their content to be treated as research data. In classroom research projects, these ethical rules remain crucial: pupils and parents should be told how data will be used, and sensitive information must be protected. Demonstrating awareness of ethical issues in your exam answers is essential when evaluating methods.

## Practical considerations for classroom research and choosing appropriate data
When you design a small piece of research for a coursework-style question, practicality matters. Time, cost, access to participants and available skills will influence your choice of method. Questionnaires and structured interviews are efficient ways to gather comparable information from many people, but they may limit depth. Unstructured interviews and observations produce rich data but are time‑consuming to collect and analyse. Sampling needs to be thought through so that your results are not hopelessly biased: if you cannot use a probability sample, be honest about the limits of generalisation. Types of questions matter; open questions generate qualitative insights while closed questions are easier to quantify. Pilot testing your questions helps spot ambiguous wording and reduce interviewer error. In exam questions that ask you to plan a study, explain why your chosen methods fit the research aim and consider practical and ethical constraints, as examiners are looking for realistic, well‑justified choices rather than perfect designs.

## Exam technique
In the exam, you will be asked to identify data, interpret evidence, evaluate methods and design a research plan. For data-response questions, start by extracting the key facts from the source material and use them directly: quote a clear statistic or a short phrase from an extract, then explain what it shows in sociological terms. For short-answer knowledge questions, give precise definitions (for example, define primary data or qualitative data) and then give a brief example. When asked to evaluate a method, structure your answer to explain strengths first, then limitations, and finish with a balanced judgement that links to validity, reliability, representativeness or ethics. In longer ‘discuss’ or ‘to what extent’ questions, use theory and evidence to support both sides of the argument and reach a reasoned conclusion. If a question asks you to design a study, state your research aim clearly, describe your primary and/or secondary sources, explain your sampling and data-collection methods, and justify each choice in terms of the research question and practical constraints; include brief ethical safeguards. Time management is essential: allow longer answers the most time, and spend a few minutes planning paragraph structure so your response reads as a coherent argument rather than a collection of facts. Finally, practise writing the pattern evidence–explanation–evaluation in every answer, and when possible use specific, realistic examples (for instance, census data, a school survey or a local news story) to show you can apply methodological ideas to real contexts.
