# Social stratification and life chances (GCSE Sociology Cambridge International)

## What is social stratification?
Social stratification describes the structured layers that exist within any society, where people are ranked or grouped according to resources, power and prestige. At its simplest, stratification is about who has more and who has less, and how these differences are organised and justified. Key concepts to learn are achieved and ascribed status: achieved status comes from effort or talent, such as a professional qualification; ascribed status is given at birth, such as caste or ethnicity in some societies. Stratification shapes everyday life because it affects access to goods and services, social influence and personal opportunities. Understanding stratification means recognising that inequality is not random but the product of social institutions, cultural ideas and historical processes that place people into enduring social positions.

## Open and closed systems of stratification
Sociologists distinguish between open and closed systems of stratification to explain how rigid or flexible social hierarchies are. In open systems, such as many modern industrial societies, social mobility is possible: individuals can move up or down the social ladder through education, work or other achievements. The idea of meritocracy—where rewards follow talent and effort—fits with this view. Closed systems, by contrast, allow little or no movement between levels. The caste system is a classic example of a closed system, where social position is largely fixed at birth and social roles are inherited. Modern forms of closure can include slavery and institutional barriers that lock groups into disadvantaged positions. Whether a society is more open or closed has profound implications for how fair people perceive it to be and how governments justify redistribution or intervention.

## Life chances: the everyday consequences of stratification
The phrase ‘life chances’ refers to the opportunities individuals have to improve their quality of life and achieve goals, and it is central to understanding the effects of stratification. Life chances are most clearly visible in education, employment, health, housing and life expectancy. Children born into wealthier families tend to attend better-resourced schools, develop cultural and social capital that helps with exams and job applications, and move into higher‑paid occupations. By contrast, poverty limits access to nutritious food, safe housing, healthcare and technology, which reduces educational attainment and long-term earning potential. Gender and ethnicity further shape life chances: women often face pay gaps and career interruptions linked to care responsibilities, while ethnic minorities may experience discrimination in labour markets and policing. Age intersects with these inequalities: young people may face unemployment and older people may face inadequate pensions or age-related discrimination. Describing life chances in these tangible terms helps connect abstract ideas about class and power to real outcomes that matter to everyday people.

## Theories that explain inequality
Sociological theories offer different lenses for explaining why stratification exists and why it persists. Functionalists argue that some level of stratification is inevitable and even useful: societies need to allocate roles, and offering higher rewards for more important or difficult jobs motivates people to train and perform. Critics of functionalism highlight its tendency to justify inequality as “necessary” and to ignore power imbalances.

Marxist theory locates inequality in the organisation of capitalism. For Marxists, class divisions arise from ownership of the means of production: a small capitalist class extracts surplus from workers, producing exploitation and a “poverty trap.” Concepts such as the reserve army of labour explain how unemployed or underemployed workers can be used to depress wages. Marxists also argue that state institutions and culture often reinforce class hegemony through ideological control.

Feminist perspectives emphasise how patriarchy intersects with class to produce gendered inequalities. Feminists show how unpaid domestic labour, the sexual division of labour and gendered expectations shape women’s life chances, explaining pay gaps and patterns of part-time work. Interactionist approaches, including labelling theory, focus on micro-level processes. They show how stereotypes, master status and the self-fulfilling prophecy can limit opportunities: once someone is labelled as “trouble” or “unqualified,” teachers, employers or police may treat them differently, reducing their future prospects.

Modern sociological thinking often combines these approaches and highlights intersectionality, the idea that race, class, gender, age and other identities overlap and produce distinctive experiences of advantage and disadvantage. Intersectionality helps explain why two people of the same social class can still have very different life chances because of gender or ethnic differences.

## How governments and organisations try to reduce inequality
Societies use a mixture of policies to reduce inequalities and improve life chances. Welfare states provide a key set of tools: progressive taxation, unemployment benefits, pensions, free or low-cost healthcare and education can reduce material disadvantage and provide safety nets. Policies such as a statutory minimum wage, public housing, and laws against discrimination aim to redistribute resources and opportunities.

Legislation for equal opportunities—on the basis of gender, race or disability—seeks to remove legal barriers to fair treatment. Educational policies, like free universal schooling and targeted scholarships, are intended to level the playing field and promote social mobility. Non-governmental organisations work internationally and locally to tackle poverty, improve healthcare, provide education and support livelihoods. NGOs can act where states do not reach, providing disaster relief, promoting grassroots projects, or campaigning for policy change.

However, attempts to reduce inequality are contested. The New Right criticises generous welfare systems for creating dependency and undermining individual initiative, while Marxists argue that welfare often masks deeper structural inequalities and preserves capitalist systems by stabilising the workforce. Feminists warn that policies that are gender-neutral in design can still reproduce inequalities unless they account for unpaid care and gendered labour markets. NGOs are sometimes criticised for paternalism, short-term fixes, or unintentionally reinforcing unequal power relations. Evaluating policy success therefore requires looking beyond intentions to outcomes and asking who benefits in practice.

## Globalisation, migration and environmental factors
Globalisation has reshaped inequalities between societies as well as within them. The growth of transnational corporations, international trade and global finance has created new wealth but also widened gaps. Some countries have benefitted from foreign investment and export markets, while others remain dependent on the export of raw materials or low-wage labour. Historical processes such as colonialism help explain persistent global inequalities: patterns of trade, resource extraction and political domination have long-term effects on development.

Migration is another crucial factor for life chances. People move across borders for work, safety or family reasons. Push factors such as poverty, conflict or environmental degradation, and pull factors such as employment opportunities and relative safety, combine to create migration flows. Migration can improve life chances through remittances, skill acquisition and social networks, but it can also create vulnerability when migrants face discrimination, legal precarity or exploitation, including modern forms of slavery.

Environmental issues and climate change disproportionately affect poorer populations and low-income countries, reducing life chances through loss of livelihoods, forced displacement and health risks. Urbanisation creates both opportunities and problems: cities offer jobs and services but unequal access to housing and sanitation can deepen social exclusion. Understanding globalisation and environment thus requires thinking about economic systems, power relations and long-term sustainability together.

## Researching and measuring inequality
Studying stratification and life chances requires careful use of data and methods. Quantitative measures such as income distribution statistics, poverty lines, unemployment rates and life expectancy highlight measurable differences between groups. Tools like the Gini coefficient provide a single-number summary of income inequality, and indices such as the Human Development Index combine health, education and income indicators to compare countries.

Qualitative research is also vital: interviews, ethnographies and case studies can reveal how people experience inequality, how stigma operates, and how institutions deliver services in practice. Sociologists must be alert to problems in measurement: official statistics may undercount informal work or hidden poverty, and self-report surveys can suffer from bias. Sampling choices, researcher effects and ethical issues matter when researching vulnerable groups. In exams you will need to recognise both the strengths and the limitations of different evidence and to explain why particular methods are appropriate for answering specific sociological questions about life chances.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on social stratification and life chances, begin by identifying exactly what the command word asks you to do. For a ‘define’ or ‘describe’ question, give a clear, concise meaning and follow it with a brief example. For ‘explain’ and ‘apply’ questions, link sociological concepts directly to the scenario in the question: show cause and effect and use evidence such as statistics, case studies or contemporary examples to support your points. For ‘discuss’ or ‘evaluate’ questions, structure your answer so that each paragraph makes a distinct point, uses theory or evidence, and considers counter-arguments. Use a range of perspectives—functionalism, Marxism, feminism and interactionism—to show depth, and finish with a short judgement that weighs the evidence.

Allocate your time according to marks. For longer essays, plan a short paragraph that defines key terms, two or three developed paragraphs that explain and apply sociological arguments with evidence, and at least one paragraph that evaluates strengths and limitations or offers alternative explanations. Use intersectionality in answers about life chances to demonstrate you appreciate complexity, and when discussing global issues, be ready to give specific examples such as the effects of migration, the role of transnational corporations, or climate impacts on vulnerable communities.

Finally, make your answers readable and precise. Signal your structure with clear topic sentences, link theory to examples, and avoid vague generalisations. Where appropriate, mention methodological issues when evaluating evidence. Practising past questions under timed conditions will help you balance knowledge, application and evaluation—the three assessment objectives that Cambridge International examines.
