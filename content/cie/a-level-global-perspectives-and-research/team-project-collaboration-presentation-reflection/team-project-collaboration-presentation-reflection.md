# Team Project: collaboration, presentation and reflection (A-level Global Perspectives & Research Cambridge International)

## What the Team Project is and why it matters
The Team Project is Component 3 of Cambridge International A‑level Global Perspectives & Research and is a deliberately practical, skills‑based task that asks small teams of students to investigate a local problem with clear global relevance. Its purpose is not simply to produce a polished product but to develop and assess the thinking and collaborative skills central to the course: the ability to analyse competing perspectives, to design and carry out focused research, to communicate arguments to a non‑specialist audience, and to reflect honestly on teamwork. Each candidate produces two individual pieces of assessed work: a short oral presentation (maximum ten minutes) that sets out their personal research and proposed solution, and a reflective paper (maximum 800 words) that evaluates how the team worked together and what the candidate learned. The project therefore combines research, communication and metacognition in a single, summative task.

## Intended learning outcomes and how the project maps to the Critical Path
The project is designed to cultivate the skills described in the syllabus’ assessment objectives. AO1 (research, analysis and evaluation) is central: students must analyse a problem from a distinct perspective, marshal evidence and justify a solution. AO2 (reflection) is assessed through the reflective paper, which asks students to examine the effectiveness of collaboration and the impact of other perspectives on their own thinking. AO3 (communication) is assessed through the presentation: clarity, structure, use of visual information and audience engagement are all considered. Pedagogically the Team Project follows the Critical Path of deconstruction, reconstruction, reflection, and communication. Students first deconstruct the problem by identifying assumptions and competing claims, then reconstruct arguments by gathering evidence and assembling a coherent case, reflect on their learning and teamwork, and finally communicate their findings in a concise, accessible presentation.

## Selecting a local problem with genuine global relevance
Choosing the right problem is the first crucial step. The team must formulate a single, sharply stated research topic that is local in focus yet clearly connected to a global issue; for example, “How can our town reduce single‑use plastic while protecting the incomes of informal waste collectors?” This kind of framing allows team members to explore different themes such as economics, environment, culture and ethics. Questions that are too local with no global resonance or that pre‑assume a single answer are unlikely to work. A successful team statement is open to multiple, globally contrasting perspectives and leaves room for each member to take a distinct angle. Teachers should encourage teams to think about scope: the problem must be big enough to allow meaningful enquiry from different viewpoints, but small enough to be researched effectively within the available time.

## Teamworking, roles and negotiating perspectives
Teams should consist of two to five members; three or four often makes collaboration manageable while offering diverse viewpoints. Good teams explicitly allocate roles and perspectives early on so that each individual is responsible for a particular line of enquiry. For example, in the plastic waste project one student might research municipal policy and budgets, another the livelihood impacts on informal recyclers, another the environmental science of microplastics, and another consumer behaviour and business practices. Teams need to agree how to share evidence, how to cross‑check sources and how to ensure everyone’s contribution is assessable as individual work. Conflict will occur, and learning to manage disagreement constructively is itself part of the assessment. Candidates should document decision points and negotiations in their notes, since these reflections will strengthen the reflective paper.

## Research methods, sources and methodology
The Team Project allows and expects a mixture of primary and secondary research. Primary evidence can include short interviews with local stakeholders, surveys of community members, observational data, or photographs; secondary evidence ranges from academic articles and policy documents to reputable news reporting and NGO reports. Candidates should be guided to think about which methods best answer their angle on the problem and why those methods are appropriate—the syllabus asks students to engage with methodology, not merely to collect data. Critical evaluation of sources is essential: candidates should comment on provenance, possible bias, sample sizes and limits of generalisability. All sources used in presentations and the reflective paper must be clearly cited and referenced in a consistent format. Teachers should model good practice in referencing and show examples of how to integrate evidence into a concise spoken narrative.

## Preparing the presentation: format, content and technical requirements
Each candidate must submit an individual presentation of no more than ten minutes. The presentation may be a live recording delivered to an audience of at least three people (one of whom must be the teacher) or a presentation with a recorded voiceover. Regardless of format, audio clarity and intelligibility are essential, so recordings should take place in a quiet environment with minimal background noise. The presentation should be accessible to a non‑specialist audience: it must state the team’s problem statement, set out the candidate’s distinct perspective, explain the research and evidence gathered, evaluate the reliability of sources, and justify the proposed solution. Visual materials—slides, images, short infographics or charts—should support the spoken argument rather than overwhelm it. Candidates must supply the audio/visual materials together with a verbatim transcript of the presentation. Be mindful that material beyond the ten‑minute limit will not be assessed.

## Writing the reflective paper: what to include and how to structure it
The reflective paper is an individual piece of up to 800 words in which the candidate assesses the effectiveness of team collaboration and reflects on personal learning. It should begin by summarising the team’s chosen problem and each member’s assigned perspective to set context, then move to a critical evaluation of how the group worked: what processes helped the team meet its aims, what barriers arose, and how conflicts were resolved or left unresolved. Candidates should link concrete examples of group interaction (for example, how evidence was shared, how decisions were made) to wider learning about research, communication or ethical issues. Reflection on how exposure to other perspectives altered the candidate’s own viewpoint is a key element; a brief discussion of what they would do differently in a future project gives useful closure. The reflective paper should be candid, evidence‑aware and focused on learning outcomes rather than simply reporting activities.

## Assessment criteria, authenticity and the teacher’s role
Candidates are assessed externally against the assessment objectives. Examiners look for individual analysis of the problem, quality and range of research, evaluation of sources, justification of the proposed solution, clarity and organisation in communication, and thoughtful reflection about teamwork and learning. Academic honesty is central: each candidate must complete a Declaration of Authenticity and centres are responsible for ensuring work is original. Teachers have an important supportive role but must not provide detailed subject guidance, research content, or correct drafts. They may help teams understand the task, approve the project statement and check that research methods and ethical considerations are appropriate, but they must not undertake research for students, write material for them, or prepare transcripts. These boundaries maintain fairness and ensure that assessment reflects candidates’ own abilities.

## Practical submission requirements and common pitfalls to avoid
All materials for Component 3 are submitted electronically according to the centre’s administrative guidance. Ensure you know the required file formats for audio/visual materials, the method for attaching transcripts, and the deadline. Common pitfalls include exceeding the ten‑minute time limit, failing to provide a verbatim transcript, poor audio quality that obscures content, weak or improperly referenced sources, and reflective papers that narrate events rather than evaluate learning. Teams sometimes make the mistake of submitting a team‑wide presentation; each candidate must submit an individual presentation even when the research was collaborative. Another frequent issue is insufficient evidence of distinct individual contribution—students should therefore be explicit in their presentations about the particular perspective they researched and the specific evidence they contributed to the team’s understanding.

## Exam technique
Approach the Team Project as a structured mini‑research assignment rather than a one‑off performance. Begin by negotiating the team problem statement carefully and write it down; this will guide all subsequent work. Allocate perspectives early and agree on a shared schedule for primary research and secondary reading so that every member has time to gather and analyse evidence. Keep a concise individual research log containing dates, contacts, sources, and decisions—this is invaluable both for the reflective paper and for demonstrating authenticity. Practice the presentation several times with a mock audience to check timing, clarity and the effectiveness of visual aids; record rehearsals to check audio quality and to edit out distracting hesitations. When preparing the transcript, ensure that quoted material in the presentation is matched with full bibliographic details. For the reflective paper, resist the urge to narrate; instead, focus on analysing what worked and why, what you learned from other perspectives, and how your approach to research or teamwork changed. Lastly, review the syllabus guidance on what teachers may and may not do so that your submission meets the authenticity rules and avoids the common administrative errors that can delay assessment. With careful planning, disciplined research and thoughtful reflection, the Team Project becomes a powerful showcase of the critical and collaborative skills the A‑level seeks to develop.
