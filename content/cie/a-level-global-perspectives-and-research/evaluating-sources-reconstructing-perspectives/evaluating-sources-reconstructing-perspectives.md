# Evaluating sources & reconstructing perspectives (A-level Global Perspectives & Research Cambridge International)

## What this topic is and why it matters
Evaluating sources and reconstructing perspectives lies at the heart of Global Perspectives & Research. The skill is not simply about collecting facts; it is about interrogating arguments, weighing evidence and rebuilding coherent worldviews from competing claims. In Cambridge International 9239 this work is practised across short timed tasks, extended essays, collaborative projects and a substantial independent research report. The aim is to enable you to read critically, to separate what is asserted from what is proven, to recognise assumptions and to produce reasoned judgements that can be communicated clearly to non-specialist audiences. These abilities are the foundation of academic study and of informed citizenship in a global context.

## The Critical Path: an organising framework
Cambridge frames the subject around the Critical Path, a repeatable sequence of steps that helps to teach and practise the core skills. The sequence begins with deconstruction: breaking a claim or source into its component parts. It moves to reconstruction: gathering and organising evidence to support competing perspectives. It continues with reflection: considering how research has changed your personal standpoint and identifying the limits of your enquiry. Finally, it ends with communication and collaboration: presenting arguments effectively and, where relevant, working with others to produce shared outcomes. The Critical Path is not a checklist to be applied mechanically; it is a way of thinking you should internalise so that each task—whether a 45‑minute exam paper question or a 5,000‑word research report—follows a disciplined process of enquiry.

## Deconstruction: analysing arguments and evidence
Deconstruction means reading sources with the purpose of isolating claims, recognising the reasons given for those claims, and testing the links between reason and conclusion. Start by identifying the conclusion the author wants you to accept and the explicit premises offered in support. Then look for unstated assumptions—beliefs and values that are not given but which the argument depends upon. Evaluate the evidence: is it primary or secondary, quantitative or qualitative, current or outdated? Consider provenance: who produced the source, when and why? A policy report commissioned by a government department will have different motives and constraints from a social media thread or a peer‑reviewed journal article. Ask how the author uses analogy, whether causal claims are justified, and whether counter‑evidence has been acknowledged. Common weaknesses to spot include overgeneralisation, cherry‑picking of data, false cause, and emotive language used to substitute for argument. In an exam question, deconstruction is usually rewarded when you show close engagement with the source—quoting selectively to illustrate a point, explaining why a particular piece of data does or does not support the conclusion, and distinguishing between fact and value judgement.

## Reconstruction: researching and building contrasting perspectives
Once you have deconstructed existing material, reconstruction asks you to gather, group and evaluate new evidence to build coherent perspectives on the issue. Good reconstruction brings together primary and secondary sources in a way that is sensitive to context. For example, when examining whether hosting the Olympics is “worth it”, you would combine economic reports on infrastructure costs and post‑event revenues, sociological studies of community displacement, and ethical commentary on public priorities. Distinguish between sources that provide strong empirical support and those that express opinions or theoretical positions. Be explicit about why particular sources are acceptable: consider methodology, sample sizes, funding and the author’s expertise. Importantly, a balanced reconstruction does not attempt to force a synthesis where one is inappropriate; instead it sets out competing perspectives and the evidence base for each, makes clear where the evidence is thin, and identifies the strongest basis for judgement. In coursework and the research report this leads to a reasoned conclusion that recognises counterarguments and the provisional nature of knowledge.

## Reflection and standpoint: how research changes you
Reflection is a higher‑order skill in this syllabus. It asks you to examine how your own viewpoint has been shaped by research and by encountering alternative perspectives. Begin by recording your initial standpoint: what did you think before investigating the issue, and why? Then explain how specific pieces of evidence or particular arguments challenged, reinforced or nuanced your position. Reflection also requires honesty about limits: what aspects of the question remain unresolved, what further evidence would be useful, and how might your cultural background or prior reading have biased your approach? In the Team Project and the Research Report you must demonstrate reflective awareness by explaining how collaboration, choice of methods, or the availability of sources affected outcomes. Reflection is not mere description; it is critical self‑evaluation that strengthens the credibility of your conclusions.

## Practicalities of coursework, authenticity and the teacher’s role
Assessment in Global Perspectives & Research requires careful attention to process as well as product. For the Essay (1,750–2,000 words), Team Project presentation and reflective paper, and the Cambridge Research Report (up to 5,000 words plus a research log), candidates must submit original work with accurate word counts and full referencing. Teachers play a supportive but constrained role: they may help students to formulate suitable research questions, run generic workshops on methods and referencing, and review proposals, but they must not write, heavily edit, or provide detailed subject guidance for individual drafts. Academic honesty is not optional. Centres must ensure candidates know how to cite, paraphrase and reference, and must complete a Declaration of Authenticity for each submission. The research log is important evidence of process: it should record planning, methodological choices, sources consulted and reflections on how the question evolved. For presentations, whether live or with a narrated slide deck, the candidate must present their own voice and provide a verbatim transcript alongside any audio/visual materials.

## Formulating good and bad research questions
A clear, well‑phrased question is the starting point for every assessed task. A strong question is phrased as a question, invites analysis from at least two globally contrasting perspectives, and allows for a reasoned judgement. For example, “Is hosting the Olympics a good use of public money?” opens space for economic, social and ethical perspectives and does not presuppose an answer. By contrast, “Explain the benefits of hosting the Olympics” is leading and unlikely to produce balanced analysis. A single‑word title such as “Industrialisation” is too broad and unfocussed. When you plan a research question for the 5,000‑word report, invest time in developing the key concepts you will use, the debates you intend to engage with and a realistic scope that you can research thoroughly. Your proposal should make clear which methods you will use, what counts as relevant evidence and how you will address ethical or practical constraints.

## Using sources intelligently: primary vs secondary and evaluating strength
Not all evidence carries equal weight. Primary sources—original documents, interviews, survey data, laboratory results—offer direct access to phenomena but may be limited by scale, bias in collection, or context. Secondary sources—reviews, analyses and commentaries—can synthesise wide literatures but may introduce interpretation. Evaluate each source for reliability, relevance and recency. Consider the method by which data were gathered, whether conclusions are reasonable given the data, and whether the source has an agenda that might shape presentation. A useful heuristic is to ask: who benefits if this claim is accepted, and what alternative explanations might undermine it? In the exam, where you are given source material, you must focus on the evidence provided, identify weaknesses and suggest what additional evidence would strengthen or refute the claim.

## Exam technique
In the written exam and in coursework, assessment objectives AO1 (research, analysis and evaluation), AO2 (reflection) and AO3 (communication) guide marking. For Component 1 the paper is source‑based: question one asks short AO1 responses, question two asks for a sustained analysis of a single source, and question three requires a comparative essay that also tests AO3. In timed exams always begin by annotating the sources to identify conclusions, premises, key evidence and assumptions. For the short structured answers allocate time carefully so you do not neglect the longer question worth the most marks. In the essay‑style responses build your argument in clear stages: define key terms, present the perspectives with supporting evidence, evaluate strengths and weaknesses, and finish with a balanced judgement that recognises limitations. Use short, well‑referenced quotations from the provided sources to support your points, but avoid over‑quoting. For the externally assessed Essay and Research Report adhere strictly to word limits and referencing rules: label your word count, include a bibliography and ensure quotations are fully referenced. In the Team Project, prepare a focused ten‑minute presentation that analyses the local problem, shows the research undertaken, evaluates sources and justifies your individual solution; keep a clear transcript and ensure any audio/visual material is audible and relevant. Across all assessments avoid plagiarism by paraphrasing correctly and citing sources, and remember that reflection must be evaluative rather than merely descriptive. Practise past papers under timed conditions, seek general feedback on structure and style from teachers, and use the Critical Path repeatedly so that deconstruction, reconstruction and reflection become second nature when you face unseen texts or complex research questions.
