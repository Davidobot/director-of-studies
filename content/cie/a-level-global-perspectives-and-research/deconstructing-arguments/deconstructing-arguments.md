# Deconstructing arguments (A-level Global Perspectives & Research Cambridge International)

## Why deconstruction matters
Deconstructing arguments is the foundational skill in Global Perspectives & Research. At its simplest, it means taking a claim apart so you can see its pieces: the conclusion it reaches, the reasons offered, the evidence used, and the assumptions that sit behind it. Learning to do this systematically helps you avoid being persuaded by rhetoric or surface detail alone. It also gives you the tools to compare competing viewpoints, to spot weaknesses in reasoning, and to build your own well‑supported judgements. In this syllabus deconstruction is embedded in the Critical Path approach: it is the first step in a deliberately iterative process that moves from analysis through research and reflection to communication.

## The Critical Path framework
The Critical Path provides a clear sequence for handling complex issues. Its stages—deconstruction, reconstruction, reflection, and communication—work together so you can move from initial reading to reasoned conclusion. Deconstruction asks you to identify the parts of an argument. Reconstruction asks you to gather and organise evidence for and against competing perspectives. Reflection asks you to test how that research affects your own viewpoint. Communication asks you to convey your judgement clearly, using evidence and appropriate academic conventions. Treat the Critical Path as a set of practices you repeat: the better you get at each stage, the more persuasive and robust your work will be.

## Deconstruction: identifying claims, reasons and assumptions
Begin deconstruction by locating the conclusion: the claim the author wants you to accept. Once you have that, find the supporting reasons or premises. Distinguish carefully between fact, opinion and inference: a datum is not the same as an interpretation of that datum. Look for unstated assumptions—beliefs taken for granted that connect the reasons to the conclusion. For example, a headline that reads “Hosting the Olympics will boost our economy” contains an implicit assumption that the costs of hosting will be outweighed by later economic benefits. In exam practice underline the conclusion and list the explicit and implicit premises. If a writer uses examples or anecdotes, treat these as evidence that need separate scrutiny rather than as decisive proof.

## Evaluating evidence and spotting common weaknesses
Not all evidence is equally strong. Evaluate sources for provenance, relevance and reliability. Check who produced the information, when and why: government statistics, academic studies, NGO reports, opinion pieces and anonymous sources have different levels of trustworthiness and potential bias. Look at how evidence supports a claim: does a statistic indicate causation or merely correlation? Is a sample size adequate? Are there countervailing data the author ignored? Be alert to common logical fallacies—appeals to emotion, false analogies, sweeping generalisations, hasty conclusions from limited data, and slippery slopes. When an argument relies on historical patterns or analogies, test whether the contexts are truly comparable. When you evaluate, explain both strengths and weaknesses and suggest what additional evidence would help decide the issue.

## Reconstruction: researching and weighing perspectives
Reconstruction is where you widen the lens. Use research to assemble multiple perspectives and to weigh the evidence supporting each. Choose sources that represent different geopolitical, cultural or disciplinary standpoints so your work reflects genuine global contrast. Organise the material by perspective rather than by source: for each coherent viewpoint set out its key claims, the evidence it uses, and its central assumptions. Synthesis is an important skill here: bring together different strands of evidence to show how they strengthen or undermine particular positions. For example, on tourism you might bring economic data about employment together with environmental impact studies and local testimonies to show that a singular claim—“tourism is always beneficial”—overlooks trade‑offs. Aim to reach a reasoned balance, where you explain why some evidence is more persuasive than other evidence rather than simply listing points for and against.

## Reflection: interrogating your standpoint
Reflection asks you to step back and consider how your own background, values and prior knowledge may have shaped your responses. Begin by noting your initial viewpoint before you researched. Then explain how new evidence or perspectives affected that view. Did learning about different global contexts alter the weight you give to certain kinds of evidence? Did you find assumptions in your own thinking that needed revision? Reflection does not demand that you abandon a position, but it does require honesty about the limits of your case and clarity about what further research would be useful. In coursework and the longer research report, strong reflective passages show intellectual maturity: they demonstrate that your judgement is provisional, evidence‑based and aware of its own constraints.

## Communicating a deconstructed and reconstructed argument
Clear structure and precise language make your argument persuasive. Start with a concise introduction that frames the question and outlines how you will proceed. In essays and reports, develop each perspective in its own section and use sub‑headings to guide the reader. Use signposting language to show the relationships between claims, evidence and assumptions. When you make a judgement, justify it by linking specific evidence to the conclusion; avoid relying on assertion. Citation and referencing are part of good communication: name sources inline where their provenance matters and include a full bibliography. For oral presentations, adapt your language for a non‑specialist audience: explain technical terms, use visuals to summarise complex evidence, and rehearse timing so each point is clear. Remember that assessment rewards reasoned, coherent argumentation supported by evidence—not theatrical delivery or unsupported opinion.

## Applying deconstruction across the assessment components
The same deconstruction skills are required across the written exam, the essay, the team project and the research report, but the emphasis shifts. In the written exam you will face source materials and be asked to identify and analyse components quickly: short structured questions test rapid identification of evidence and weaknesses, while longer responses expect comparative evaluation and a clear judgement. Practice reading sources under timed conditions and annotating them to extract premises and evidence. In the essay you must devise a focused question that allows globally contrasting perspectives, then use research to reconstruct and evaluate those perspectives before arriving at a supported conclusion; strict adherence to the 1750–2000 word limit and accurate referencing are mandatory. In the team project you will apply deconstruction collaboratively: the team defines a local problem with global relevance, then each member researches from a distinct perspective and presents their individually justified solution; your reflective paper should analyse how teamwork affected the inquiry. For the Cambridge Research Report you will demonstrate the full Critical Path: a research question, a log of decisions and reflections, an explanation of chosen research methods and methodology, and an extended, evidence‑based discussion of perspectives leading to a reasoned judgement within 5000 words.

## Academic honesty and practical tips for teaching
Authenticity matters. All coursework and reports must be your own work, properly referenced. Teachers may guide and approve topics, review proposals and discuss progress, but they must not draft or substantially correct students’ work. Use the research proposal and log as teaching tools: a well‑completed proposal clarifies scope and concepts, while a clear log shows how evidence and thinking evolved. Teach students to evaluate provenance and to interrogate methodology when assessing sources. Encourage practice with past papers and timed source analyses. When supervising, give feedback that prompts further thinking rather than providing answers. Finally, practice paraphrasing and referencing so that students avoid inadvertent plagiarism and can present others’ ideas as the building blocks of their own reasoned arguments.

## Exam technique
When preparing for the written exam, allocate your time to reflect the marks available. Spend a short concentrated period on Question 1 to extract explicit evidence and label conclusions. For the longer Question 2 focus closely on the source’s evidence: evaluate reliability, relevance and the extent to which the evidence supports the claims. For Question 3 plan a short outline before you write: state the issue, compare the perspectives clearly, evaluate the arguments and evidence for each, expose assumptions and end with a balanced, justified judgement. In essays and reports, spend time crafting a precise research question and a clear introduction that defines key concepts. Use paragraphs to isolate lines of reasoning, and link each paragraph back to the question. Keep within word limits: overlong work risks losing reward, while concise, well‑structured prose often scores higher. When presenting, aim for clarity and engagement: use visuals sparingly to support key claims, rehearse timing, and submit an accurate transcript where required. Above all, show your reasoning: examiners are assessing how you deconstruct arguments, reconstruct evidence into coherent perspectives, reflect on the implications, and communicate conclusions—so make every step of that process visible in your answers.
