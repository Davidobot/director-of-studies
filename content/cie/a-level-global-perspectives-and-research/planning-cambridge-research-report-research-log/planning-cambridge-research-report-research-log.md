# Planning the Cambridge Research Report & research log (A-level Global Perspectives & Research Cambridge International)

## What the Cambridge Research Report is for and how it fits the course
The Cambridge Research Report (Component 4) is the central independent research task of the A Level Global Perspectives & Research course. It asks you to design and carry out a sustained investigation into a single question of your own choosing, write up the findings in a report of up to 5000 words aimed at a non‑specialist reader, and keep a research log that documents planning, decisions and reflections. The report itself is worth 75 marks and the research log a further 10 marks; both are externally assessed. The task draws together the core skills emphasised throughout the course: careful research and evaluation (AO1), reflective thinking about your process and standpoint (AO2) and clear communication of complex ideas to a general audience (AO3). Planning for this component therefore needs to start early, with a carefully considered proposal and realistic timetable, a clear idea of methods and evidence, and a disciplined approach to recording and reflecting in the research log.

## Using the Critical Path to plan your project
The Critical Path is the syllabus’ organising approach to research: deconstruction, reconstruction, reflection and communication. When you plan your Research Report, these stages should shape your thinking from the first proposal to the final edit. Deconstruction involves identifying the arguments, assumptions and evidence that already exist around your question. Reconstruction is the active stage of gathering and weighing new evidence, grouping it into perspectives and building a reasoned argument. Reflection is an ongoing activity: you must explain how research changed your view, why you chose particular methods, and what limits your findings have. Communication requires you to express the material clearly and logically so that someone without subject expertise can grasp the debate and your judgement. Framing the project around these linked processes helps you produce a coherent report and a research log that demonstrates purposeful development rather than a diary of random actions.

## Choosing a topic and formulating a strong research question
Choosing a topic that genuinely interests you makes the many hours of research manageable and often leads to better work. The syllabus suggests broad global topics such as technology, climate change, migration, or ethics of food; these can be narrowed to produce a researchable question that invites contrasting perspectives. A good research question is phrased explicitly as a question, gives scope for debate from at least two globally contrasting perspectives, and does not pre-judge the answer. For example, “Is industrialisation a good thing?” is a productive question because it opens up economic, environmental and social perspectives and does not presuppose a single answer. By contrast, “Has industrialisation been environmentally damaging?” tends to nudge the project towards one line of inquiry and can limit the space for balanced comparison. Your research proposal must state the question, identify the key concepts you will use, sketch the debate you intend to address and list initial sources. Teachers review and approve this proposal to make sure the question is appropriate in scale and scope; they do not write it for you or give detailed content. Spend time refining your question: getting it right at the start saves time later and ensures the report meets the assessment criteria.

## Selecting methods, evidence and considering methodology
Your choice of research methods should follow from the question and the kinds of evidence needed to answer it. Research can draw on primary evidence such as interviews, surveys, field observation, experiments, historical documents or close textual analysis, and on secondary evidence like academic articles, policy reports or reputable statistics. For some projects a literature review and theoretical analysis are appropriate; for others, collecting new data is necessary. Importantly, you must explain why the chosen methods are suitable, and reflect on how methodology shapes what can be concluded. This means considering issues such as sample size and sampling bias for surveys, the reliability and provenance of secondary sources, ethical constraints when interviewing people, and limitations in generalising from small-scale qualitative studies. A methodologically aware report discusses strengths and weaknesses of the evidence and links them to the judgements you make. This discussion is core to AO1 and AO2: assessors look for a reasoned account of why those methods were selected and how they affect the trustworthiness of your conclusions.

## The research log: what to record and how to make it count
The research log is not a transcription of every action you take; it is a focused document that records planning, methodological choices, key findings, and reflective thinking. It should be kept as a separate file to the report and submitted alongside it. Useful entries include short dated notes explaining why you adjusted your question, how you selected or rejected potential sources, what ethical issues emerged in interviews and how you addressed them, and brief reflections on how new evidence affected your interpretation. Logs which show regular, purposeful reflection score well: an entry that notes “Interview with farmer A highlighted local economic drivers I had not considered; will pursue local statistics to triangulate” demonstrates active reconstruction and reflection better than undated or general notes. The log can be in note form or a mix of notes and prose; it does not count towards the 5000‑word limit of the report. Remember that the log is assessed, so quality, relevance and reflection matter more than length.

## Structuring the report, referencing and writing for a non‑specialist audience
The Research Report should be structured with a clear introduction, a coherent main body that develops and compares perspectives, a conclusion that justifies your judgement, and a methodology section that explains how you carried out the research and the limitations you encountered. Sub‑headings are permitted and often helpful for navigation, but the prose should flow and the report must remain continuous rather than a collection of disconnected fragments. All quotations and specific factual claims need full bibliographical references; the choice of referencing style (for example Harvard, APA or Chicago) is yours but must be used consistently. The word limit is 5000 words and must be stated accurately on the title page; the title and bibliography do not count in the limit, and work beyond the maximum will not be marked. Because the report is for a non‑specialist reader, explain specialist terms briefly and avoid unnecessary technical detail that obscures your reasoning. Judges will value clear expression that communicates complex ideas simply without losing nuance. Appendices can be useful for raw data or extended tables but should only contain material directly relevant to the argument; appendices are not a way to circumvent the main word limit.

## Teacher involvement, authenticity and submitting your work
Teachers play an important supporting role: they should help you choose a suitably scaled topic, approve the research proposal, run workshops on methods and referencing, and monitor progress through discussion of the research log. However, teachers must not undertake your research, correct drafts in detail, prepare parts of the report, write transcripts, or make subject‑specific suggestions that replace student initiative. Every candidate must complete a Declaration of Authenticity confirming the work is their own. Cambridge uses plagiarism detection tools, so accurate citation and honest acknowledgment of collaboration are essential. All materials — the report, the research log and the research proposal form — must be submitted electronically by the centre according to the deadlines and file formats required. Keep careful copies of everything and note submission procedures well before the deadline to avoid last‑minute problems.

## Exam technique
Approaching the Research Report with exam‑style discipline improves both the quality of your research and the marks you receive. Begin by drafting a realistic timetable that allocates time for proposal refinement, literature review, primary data collection, analysis, writing, and multiple rounds of revision. Early on, write a tight research proposal: a sharply formulated question reduces wasted effort and shows examiners that your project is focused. When you collect evidence, prioritise quality over quantity; a few high‑quality, well‑analysed sources or interviews are more persuasive than a long list of weak or poorly understood references. As you write, treat the methodology and limitations section as substantive rather than perfunctory: a thoughtful appraisal of weaknesses and trade‑offs demonstrates mature judgment and contributes to AO2 marks. Keep a running citation list in the referencing style you have chosen so that the bibliography is complete and consistent at submission. Monitor your word count as you go; aim to draft at about 4500 words and use the remaining space for tightening argument and polishing language rather than adding new material. Use your research log to record key decisions and reflections that you can then summarise and integrate into the main report without copying log material verbatim into the 5000 words. Finally, proofread thoroughly for clarity, coherence and accuracy, ensure your title page includes the declared word count, complete the Declaration of Authenticity, and check file formats and submission instructions well before the deadline. Following these strategies will make your independent research more manageable and your final report more convincing.
