# Global Perspectives essay writing (A-level Global Perspectives & Research Cambridge International)

## Overview of the task and what examiners expect
The Component 2 essay in Cambridge International A‑level Global Perspectives & Research is a sustained piece of academic writing of 1750–2000 words in which you investigate a global issue you have studied, present contrasting perspectives, evaluate evidence and reach a reasoned, personally supported judgement. Externally assessed against the syllabus assessment objectives, the essay tests your ability to research and synthesise material (AO1), to reflect on how alternative perspectives affect your own viewpoint (AO2), and to communicate a clear, structured argument using appropriate referencing (AO3). Examiners will be looking for essays that demonstrate balanced engagement with at least two globally contrasting perspectives, careful evaluation of sources and arguments, and a reflective awareness of the limitations of your research and conclusions.

## Understanding the assessment objectives and the Critical Path
The Critical Path used in the course—deconstruction, reconstruction, reflection, communication—maps directly onto the skills the essay must show. Deconstruction means breaking down arguments to identify premises, assumptions and evidence. Reconstruction is the careful reassembly of those components through research: locating and weighing primary and secondary sources to build coherent perspectives. Reflection requires you to examine how engaging with alternative views has altered or reinforced your original standpoint and to indicate further research that would be useful. Communication asks you to present your argument in continuous prose, well structured and appropriately referenced for a non‑specialist audience. Throughout planning and drafting you should constantly ask the Critical Path questions: what claims are being made, what supports them, how reliable is that support, what assumptions are present, and what consequences follow from each position?

## Choosing a question: scope, global contrast and originality
Selecting your essay question is a decisive step. The title must be phrased as a question and should invite genuinely contrasting global perspectives rather than a narrowly local or descriptive response. Good questions are open, debatable and allow you to explore political, economic, cultural, ethical or scientific themes as relevant. For example, rather than “Industrialisation” or “Has industrialisation been environmentally damaging?” a more suitable title would be “Is industrialisation a net benefit to developing societies?” because it allows you to present economic and ethical perspectives from different global contexts, to marshal quantitative and observational evidence, and to evaluate assumptions about progress and environmental cost. The best questions arise from your genuine interest: choose an issue you want to explore in depth, and ensure it connects to at least two contrasting perspectives that can be framed from different regions, cultures or interest groups.

## Research strategy and evaluating sources
Your research must be evidence‑based and show an appropriate mix of primary and secondary material when relevant. Primary evidence could include interviews, surveys, official statistics, government documents, historical texts or scientific data. Secondary sources will include scholarly articles, reputable news reporting, think‑tank analyses and expert commentary. When selecting sources, consider provenance: who produced the source, when and why, and what perspective does that background suggest? Assess credibility by checking expertise, methodology, transparency and potential bias. A well‑argued essay does not simply collect supportive quotations; it interrogates the strength of evidence and explains why one type of evidence might be more persuasive in a particular argument. Always keep notes on your research decisions and draft a brief evaluative comment for each key source—this will help later when you justify your selection in the essay and in the reflective element required by AO2.

## Structuring the essay for clarity and balance
A clear structure improves readability and helps examiners follow your reasoning. Begin with an introduction that analyses the question: define key terms, set the global context and explain which perspectives you will examine and why. State briefly your approach and the kinds of evidence you will use. The main body should present each perspective relatively independently, showing the argument, supporting evidence and assumptions for each, and then evaluate its strengths and weaknesses in relation to available evidence. Where appropriate, use sub‑headings to guide the reader, but remember the work must be continuous prose. After presenting perspectives, devote a synthesis section to compare and weigh them: do different kinds of evidence point in the same or different directions? Are trade‑offs involved? This is the point to demonstrate higher‑order thinking—synthesising arguments rather than merely describing them. Conclude by giving a reasoned personal judgement that is explicitly supported by the evidence you have discussed, and then offer a short reflection on limits to your research and recommended further research directions.

## Writing style, referencing and academic honesty
Write for a non‑specialist educated audience: avoid unnecessary jargon, define technical terms you do use, and make your reasoning explicit. Use signposting language to clarify how each paragraph contributes to your overall argument. Quotations can be useful but should be sparing and fully referenced; lengthy quotes add little and reduce the original argument you need to display. Choose a consistent referencing style—Harvard, APA or Chicago are all acceptable—and apply it throughout. The essay must include a list of sources and full bibliographical references for any quotations. Exceeding the 2000‑word maximum invalidates material beyond that point, so state your precise word count clearly and keep the title, references and citations outside that count. Remember that the essay must be entirely your own work. Teachers may support your planning and general approach, but they must not give detailed guidance on content or edit drafts. A Declaration of Authenticity must accompany your submission; Cambridge uses plagiarism detection tools, so always cite borrowed ideas and avoid copying text from other writers without attribution.

## What examiners reward: depth, balance and reflection
Markers are looking for essays that go beyond description to show engagement with competing viewpoints and the quality of the evidence supporting each. Depth comes from selecting a manageable question and investigating it with suitable evidence rather than attempting to cover too broad a terrain superficially. Balance is shown by giving serious consideration to perspectives you may personally disagree with, evaluating their arguments and demonstrating why some evidence is more persuasive. Reflection is demonstrated when you explain how encountering alternative arguments affected your view and when you identify the principal limitations of your research—data gaps, methodological weak spots, or the need for more geographically diverse sources. Finally, explicit discussion of methodology—why certain methods were chosen and their implications—strengthens the essay, especially at A‑level where research design and methodology are part of the assessment criteria.

## Common pitfalls and practical tips for teachers and students
A common error is choosing a question that is either too narrow (purely local and unable to generate global perspectives) or too broad (impossible to treat adequately within the word limit). Avoid overreliance on a single source or on anecdotal evidence. Do not treat the essay as a chance to argue from unsupported opinion; every claim should be linked to evidence and explained. Manage your time in research and drafting: plan a timeline that allows for researching, drafting, feedback at a general level from your teacher, and careful proofreading. Teachers should guide students in question formulation, approve research plans, and provide general feedback on structure and methodology without directing the content. Encourage students to keep a short research notebook for their key sources and decisions, and to practise the Critical Path in class by deconstructing and reconstructing sample arguments before attempting the final essay.

## Exam technique
Approach the essay as a research argument, not as a report. Begin by analysing the question carefully and decide which perspectives will give you the best opportunity to show critical analysis and synthesis. Draft a brief plan outlining the line of argument and the evidence you will use for each perspective; this plan will save time in the writing stage and keep your essay focused. Write a concise introduction that defines terms and maps the essay; then allocate roughly equal space to each major perspective, followed by a synthesis where you compare and weigh evidence and assumptions. In your judgement, be explicit about why the evidence leads you to your conclusion, and immediately follow the judgement with a short reflective paragraph that acknowledges limitations and suggests further research. Keep your prose clear and concise, reference consistently, and monitor your word count so you remain between 1750 and 2000 words. Before submission, proofread to correct grammar and to ensure each paragraph ties back to the question. Finally, remember that originality, balance and evidence‑based reasoning are the foundations of a high‑scoring essay: demonstrate the Critical Path in every section and make your personal judgement both principled and supported by the research you present.
