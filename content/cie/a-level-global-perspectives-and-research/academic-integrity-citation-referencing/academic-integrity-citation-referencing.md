# Academic integrity, citation and referencing (A-level Global Perspectives & Research Cambridge International)

## Why academic integrity matters in Global Perspectives & Research
Academic integrity is the foundation of credible research and reasoned argument, and it is central to the Global Perspectives & Research course. This subject asks you to interrogate evidence, compare perspectives and make independent judgements; those judgements only have value if the work is honestly produced and sources are correctly acknowledged. Universities and employers expect work to be original, attributable and transparent: they rely on clear records of how conclusions were reached. In practical terms, demonstrating academic integrity protects you from accusations of cheating, helps you develop trustworthy research habits, and ensures that evaluators can distinguish your ideas from the evidence and opinions you have consulted.

## What academic honesty looks like: key principles
Academic honesty means always distinguishing your own ideas from those of others, giving credit where it is due, and reporting methods and evidence honestly. In the context of this syllabus, that includes acknowledging quotations, paraphrases and ideas taken from books, articles, web pages, interviews, datasets and any other sources. It also means maintaining truthful research logs and reports about how evidence was gathered and analysed, and being clear about limitations in your methods or conclusions. The syllabus emphasises the need for a Declaration of Authenticity for each candidate’s coursework and research report; this is a formal statement that the submitted work is your own and that sources have been cited appropriately.

## Plagiarism, detection and consequences
Plagiarism occurs when someone else’s words, data or ideas are presented as your own without adequate acknowledgement. This can be deliberate, but it can also happen unintentionally when notes are poorly managed or paraphrasing is too close to the original. Cambridge International uses plagiarism-detection tools as part of its standard procedures, so it is not enough to hope that borrowed material will go unnoticed. The consequences for coursework and research being flagged as non-original can include loss of marks, disqualification of the work, and in serious cases reporting to the centre and awarding body. To avoid these outcomes, keep careful records of your sources, use quotation marks for direct quotes, and always provide a full reference for any material you draw on.

## How to cite and reference: practical guidance
Referencing is a way of recording the provenance of the ideas and evidence you use so that others can check and follow up on your work. The syllabus does not prescribe a single referencing system; many candidates use familiar conventions such as Harvard, APA or Chicago. Whatever system you choose, the important points are consistency and completeness. In continuous essays and reports include in-text citations or parenthetical references that identify the author and year (for example, Smith, 2020) or use numbered footnotes if that is the preferred convention. Every in-text citation must match a full bibliographic entry in the bibliography, where you give full details: author(s), year, title, publisher, and where applicable page range, DOI or stable URL and date accessed for online material. For interviews and original data, record the name of the interviewee, the date and the context, and ensure you have the right to use and publish the material. Quotations should be short and clearly indicated with quotation marks; long quotations are rarely necessary in coursework that values synthesis and analysis. A good rule for coursework and the research report is to show understanding by paraphrasing and synthesising multiple sources, while using direct quotation sparingly to preserve the voice of your own argument.

## Paraphrasing, note-taking and building a bibliography
Effective paraphrasing means expressing the original idea in your own words and sentence structure while still crediting the source. A common mistake is to change only a few words; this can still be considered plagiarism. When you take notes, distinguish immediately and clearly between exact quotations, paraphrase-ready summaries and your own thoughts. Record full bibliographic details at the time you consult a source: author, title, publisher or website, publication date, page numbers and the date you accessed online materials. For web sources include the URL and the access date, because online content can change. Build your bibliography as you go rather than at the end; this saves time and reduces the risk of missing or incorrect references when submission deadlines approach.

## Research ethics, methods and the research log
The A Level Cambridge Research Report and the Team Project expect you to use appropriate research methods and to reflect on their suitability. Research ethics matter: if you plan to interview people, run surveys, or collect data from vulnerable groups, obtain informed consent, protect anonymity where necessary, and ensure that participation is voluntary. Teachers will review your research proposal to check that ethical and safety issues have been considered. The research log required by Component 4 is not a bureaucratic formality but an essential record of how your project developed. Use the log to record decisions about methods, to note changes in question wording, to reflect on emerging findings and to document practical steps such as dates of interviews and how data was stored. Inspectors and examiners look for evidence that the final report is grounded in an honest, traceable process, and the log helps to demonstrate that.

## Roles and responsibilities: what teachers and candidates can and cannot do
The syllabus sets out clear boundaries for supervisory support. Teachers are expected to help you understand the nature of the task, approve research proposals, monitor progress and advise on generic research and referencing skills. However, teachers must not undertake research for you, correct or edit drafts in a way that changes the substance of your work, prepare parts of presentations or reports for you, or give detailed subject-specific guidance that would compromise the candidate’s ownership of the work. During the Team Project you will collaborate to define the problem and may share background research, but every candidate must produce an individual presentation and a reflective paper that reflect their own research and perspectives. When you submit work, a Declaration of Authenticity must accompany the materials; the centre is responsible for verifying that submissions are genuinely the candidate’s own work.

## Practical tips to prevent problems
Develop a consistent habit of recording provenance information straight away and keeping a single, well-organised folder or reference manager for all your sources. When you quote, use quotation marks and include an exact reference with page numbers. When you paraphrase, rephrase the idea fully and still cite the source. Use your research log to record when you first accessed each source, why you used it, and how it shaped your thinking. Before submission, run through your bibliography to check completeness and consistency, and ensure your word counts are accurate: essays must be 1750–2000 words and research reports must not exceed 5000 words; work beyond the limits will not be marked. Remember that the Team Project presentation has a maximum running time of ten minutes and the reflective paper a maximum of 800 words, and that transcripts and supporting materials must be submitted as required. If in doubt about whether a form of help is acceptable, ask your teacher early and get written clarification.

## Exam technique
In the written exam (Component 1) you will be given source documents and assessed on your analysis, evaluation and comparison of perspectives rather than on external knowledge. Effective exam technique is therefore to refer precisely to the sources provided: identify the claims, evaluate the evidence within the source, compare how each source constructs its argument and note any assumptions. Use the Critical Path approach in the time available: deconstruct arguments, reconstruct alternative viewpoints using evidence from the sources, and communicate a clear, reasoned judgement. When writing essays and reports for Components 2 and 4, make the provenance of your ideas explicit. Open with a clear question and outline which perspectives you will examine. Use in-text references to anchor claims and place direct quotations sparingly. When balancing perspectives, show how differing evidence leads to different conclusions and explain why you prefer one judgement over another, supported by evidence. Keep your language precise, present a structured argument with signposted sections, and end with a conclusion that summarises the evidence and reflects on limitations and possible further research. Finally, allow time before submission to check that your citations and bibliography are complete and consistent, that word counts are stated and accurate, and that any required declarations and transcripts are attached. Honesty, clarity and careful documentation will strengthen both the substance and the credibility of your work.
