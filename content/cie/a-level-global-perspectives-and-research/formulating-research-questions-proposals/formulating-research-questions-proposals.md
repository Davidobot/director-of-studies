# Formulating research questions and proposals (A-level Global Perspectives & Research Cambridge International)

## Purpose and place of the research question
At A Level the research question is the engine that drives your Cambridge Research Report. It focuses enquiry, determines methods and shapes the evidence you collect. The syllabus expects a single, clear question that opens up a debate rather than simply asking for a descriptive account. Your question should make it possible to identify different perspectives, to weigh evidence and to reach a reasoned judgement. In other words, the question must be researchable, suitably bounded and intellectually interesting: it should allow you to demonstrate the core assessment objectives (AO1 research, analysis and evaluation; AO2 reflection; AO3 communication) by producing an evidence-based argument that a non‑specialist reader can follow.

## Choosing your topic and identifying the issue
Choosing a topic begins with something that genuinely interests you from the syllabus list, such as tourism, climate change, migration or the ethics of food. A topic is broad; to create useful research you must identify an issue within it that has global relevance but can be investigated within the constraints of the A Level project. Think of an issue as the practical focus of inquiry: for tourism, an issue might be whether tourist firms should pay local environmental levies; for technology, whether data control strengthens or undermines rising global powers. Good issues are specific enough to allow focused research but open enough to admit contrasting perspectives and types of evidence.

## From topic to question: refining and testing a draft question
Turning an issue into a strong research question is an exercise in refinement. A weak question is vague or simply factual, for example “Industrialisation effects?” or “Tourism in Barcelona.” A better question gives direction and invites evaluation: “To what extent does mass tourism benefit local communities in [specific place]?” Avoid questions that presuppose an answer or are one‑sided, such as “Has industrialisation been environmentally damaging?” because such wording implies a conclusion and narrows the debate. Instead aim for questions that require comparison, explanation and judgement, for example “Is industrialisation a good thing?”—this invites you to assemble different arguments, weigh evidence and explain underlying assumptions. As you refine your wording, test the question by asking whether it will let you: identify at least two contrasting, globally situated perspectives; gather relevant primary and/or secondary evidence; and reach a supported conclusion within the 5,000 word maximum.

## What a research proposal must contain and the teacher’s role
Before you start full research you must submit a research proposal that your teacher reviews and approves. The proposal should set out the research question, explain the key concepts involved, sketch the debate you intend to address and list initial sources you will use. It is also useful to summarise proposed methods and any ethical or practical constraints. The teacher’s role is to check that the question gives scope for meeting the assessment criteria and that the project is feasible in scale and safe to carry out. Teachers can advise on the shape and scope of the question and suggest types of sources, but they must not do the research for you, draft text or offer detailed editorial corrections. The hallmark of a properly supervised proposal is active guidance on suitability and feasibility while leaving the intellectual work and decisions to the candidate.

## Methods, evidence and research methodology
Selecting appropriate research methods is crucial and must be justified in the proposal and the final report. Methods might include analysing secondary literature, close textual analysis, statistical analysis, surveys, interviews, ethnographic observation or small experiments. Primary evidence (original interviews, surveys, observations, measurements) can strengthen a report but demands careful design and ethical consideration. Secondary evidence (books, journal articles, reports) helps you situate your work in existing debates. The methodology element asks you to explain why your chosen methods are suitable for answering the question and to reflect on their limitations: this is where you show you understand how knowledge is produced in your chosen field and why certain approaches are more appropriate than others.

## Research log, reflection and developing perspective
Throughout the project you must keep a research log that records plans, sources consulted, key decisions and reflections on how your thinking develops. The log is not a diary of every tiny action, but evidence that you have engaged in an iterative research process: sketching ideas, adapting the question, choosing or discarding methods, and responding to new findings. Reflective entries should explain why you made methodological or conceptual changes and how alternative perspectives influenced your conclusions. This reflective practice is assessed (AO2) and helps examiners see how you arrived at your final judgement rather than merely reading a polished final argument.

## Scope, feasibility, ethics and safety
A successful proposal demonstrates realism about what can be achieved within the time available. A common error is choosing a topic that is either too vast or too technical; avoid projects that require large datasets you cannot access or specialist laboratory work. When planning primary research, plan for consent, anonymity and the ethical implications of working with people or sensitive data. Make a note in your proposal and log of how you will protect participants and handle data securely. Teachers will check that the project does not create safety or safeguarding risks, and you should be ready to adapt methods if access proves difficult.

## Referencing, academic honesty and presenting for a non-specialist audience
Your final report must acknowledge where ideas and evidence come from: consistent and complete referencing is required, whether you use Harvard, APA, Chicago or another recognised style. The report is aimed at a non‑specialist reader, so avoid highly technical language or, if specialist terms are necessary, define them clearly. Academic honesty is essential: present your own analysis, cite sources properly and use quotation marks for direct quotes. Plagiarism is treated seriously and centres use detection software, so always keep notes that show which ideas are yours and which are drawn from others. Include a bibliography and make sure quotations have full bibliographical references. The research proposal and final report both require a Declaration of Authenticity to confirm the work is your own.

## Planning, word limits and submission requirements
Plan a realistic timetable that allows time for proposal development, research, data collection, analysis, drafting and revision. Keep to the required word limits: the Research Report must not exceed 5,000 words and the Research Log is a separate document not included in that limit. State the word count clearly on the front page; material beyond the 5,000 word limit will not be marked. Your proposal form and research log must be submitted along with the final report, and all items are submitted electronically according to the Administrative Guide. Remember that drafting is allowed and normal, but teachers should not correct or substantially edit your drafts; their feedback should be general and focused on helping you manage the task rather than rewriting content.

## Exam technique
When preparing your research proposal and question, present a concise rationale that explains why the question matters, what concepts you will use and how your chosen methods will produce relevant evidence. In the proposal, make sure the question is phrased as a question, avoids bias and explicitly allows for at least two globally contrasting perspectives. In your written report, structure the argument clearly with an introduction that sets out the question and approach, a body that evaluates evidence and perspectives, and a conclusion that gives a justified judgement and reflects on limitations and further research. Use the research log to show decision points and reflections rather than to extend the report. Always check your referencing for consistency, state your word count, and ensure that any primary research followed ethical guidelines and has appropriate consent. Examiners are looking for evidence of critical thinking, balanced evaluation of perspectives, justified methodological choices and clear communication; show how each section of your work meets AO1, AO2 and AO3 by linking evidence to argument, reflecting on perspective shifts, and writing for a non‑specialist audience.
