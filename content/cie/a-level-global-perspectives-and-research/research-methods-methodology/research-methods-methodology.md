# Research methods and methodology (A-level Global Perspectives & Research Cambridge International)

## Purpose and overview of research in Global Perspectives & Research
Research is at the heart of Cambridge International A-level Global Perspectives & Research. The course trains you to become an independent enquirer who can analyse complex global issues, compare contrasting viewpoints, and reach reasoned conclusions supported by evidence. Assessments are designed to test three interlinked capacities: research, analysis and evaluation (AO1); reflection on learning and standpoint (AO2); and clear communication (AO3). Across the components you will practise the same intellectual skills in different formats: the source-based written exam tests deconstruction and comparison of perspectives, the essay asks for a sustained, referenced argument, the team project combines group problem identification with individual presentation and reflection, and the Cambridge Research Report requires a full independent research project framed around a single question. Understanding how methods and methodology feed into these tasks will make your research more purposeful, ethically sound and convincing.

## The Critical Path: a practical methodology for thinking and research
A central pedagogical tool in this syllabus is the Critical Path, a practical sequence that guides research from careful analysis to communication and reflection. The first stage, deconstruction, asks you to unpack arguments: identify conclusions, premises, assumptions, types of evidence and any gaps in reasoning. The second stage, reconstruction, is where you gather and weigh evidence, group sources, and build coherent perspectives that answer the research question. Reflection is the third stage and requires you to examine how evidence and alternative perspectives have influenced your own viewpoint and to consider limitations and future research directions. The final stage is communication and collaboration: you must present findings with clarity and, in the Team Project, work with others to test how well collaborative solutions hold up. Internally consistent use of the Critical Path helps you move from collecting information to producing justified judgements, and it maps directly onto the assessment objectives used by examiners.

## Choosing a topic and formulating a research question
Selecting an effective research question is the single most important step in producing good work. Start with a broad global topic that interests you—climate change, migration, media and communication, or medical ethics are typical choices—and then narrow to an issue that lends itself to contrasting perspectives. A strong question is framed as a question, not a statement, and allows balanced enquiry. For example, “Is industrialisation a good thing?” invites examination of economic, environmental and social evidence and multiple well-argued positions, while “Has industrialisation been environmentally damaging?” risks a presumptive or one-sided project. Your proposal should explain why the question matters, outline key concepts and potential perspectives, and suggest initial sources. Teachers will review and approve your research proposal to ensure scope, feasibility and safety. Spend time on this preparatory phase: a carefully formed question simplifies method choice, data collection and argument structure later on.

## Research methods and the role of methodology
Research methods are the practical tools you use to gather evidence. Methodology is the reflection on why those tools are appropriate for your question and what their limitations are. Depending on your topic, you might draw heavily on secondary literature review and close textual analysis, or you may produce primary data through interviews, focus groups, surveys, experiments or observation. Quantitative methods such as surveys and statistical analysis are useful when you need measurable patterns and comparisons; qualitative methods such as interviews and ethnography are appropriate when you need depth, context and the meanings people attach to experience. Mixed-methods designs combine both to triangulate findings and strengthen claims. Writing up your project requires a clear methodology section that justifies method selection, explains sampling strategy and details data collection and analysis procedures. You should also consider validity, reliability and generalisability: explain what your methods can and cannot show, and how that affects the confidence you place in your conclusions.

## Practical issues: ethics, sampling, data management and the research log
Responsible research attends to ethical as well as practical constraints. If your project involves human participants, you must consider consent, confidentiality, and whether vulnerable groups are involved. Anonymise participants where needed and, if collecting sensitive data, ensure storage and use comply with guidance given by your centre. Sampling decisions—who you interview or survey and why—should be justified in relation to your research question; purposive sampling is common for qualitative work while random or stratified sampling supports quantitative claims. Pilot your instruments, such as questionnaires, to catch ambiguous items and to estimate response rates. Keep raw data securely and back it up. Throughout the research process keep a research log: a separate document that records planning, changes to the question, reasons for method choices, difficulties encountered and reflective notes. The log is assessed in the Research Report and is essential evidence of the authenticity and evolution of your project. It should not be used to extend the word count of the report, but it is a valuable tool for writing your methodology and reflection sections.

## Presenting research: structure, referencing and audience
Different assessment components require different forms of presentation, but all demand clarity, structure and appropriate use of evidence. Essays must be written in continuous prose between 1750 and 2000 words, include a clear research question as the title, and show balanced comparison of globally contrasting perspectives. The Research Report allows up to 5000 words and should be aimed at a non-specialist audience, explaining key concepts and methods without excessive technicality. Both essays and reports need an introduction that sets the question and scope, a main body that organises perspectives and evidence logically, and a conclusion that makes a supported judgement while acknowledging limitations and suggesting areas for further research. For the Team Project each candidate prepares a 10-minute individual presentation that demonstrates personal research and a justified solution, together with an 800-word reflective paper on teamwork effectiveness and individual learning. Whatever format you use, adopt a consistent referencing system—Harvard, APA or Chicago are common—cite quotations fully, provide a bibliography and include a clear word count. For recorded presentations check audio quality, ensure visuals are legible to a non-specialist audience, and supply a verbatim transcript with your submission.

## Academic honesty, teacher support and assessment requirements
Authenticity is non-negotiable. All assessed work must be your own. Teachers will support you by reviewing proposals, discussing drafts at a high level and helping you develop research skills, but they must not prepare subject-specific content, correct drafts in detail, or undertake research for you. Centres are required to submit a Declaration of Authenticity with coursework and to keep records that support the originality of candidates’ work. Cambridge uses plagiarism detection and expects proper citation of others’ ideas. When using other people’s words, quote sparingly and reference precisely; when paraphrasing, make sure the expression is your own and the source is acknowledged. Deadlines and submission formats differ by component and must be followed: essays and reports are submitted electronically, Team Project materials must include audio/visual files and transcripts, and research proposals and logs must accompany Research Reports. Familiarise yourself with the administrative guidance from your centre early so technicalities do not compromise your marks.

## Exam technique
Approach the written exam and coursework with a strategic mindset. For Component 1, which lasts one hour and thirty minutes and contains three compulsory questions based on two unseen sources, allocate time to careful reading and annotation before answering. For Question 1 use concise answers focused on evidence and provenance; for Question 2 examine the chosen source closely and evaluate the strength of its evidence; for Question 3 plan a short essay that compares perspectives and reaches a balanced judgement. In all source work, start by deconstructing arguments: identify conclusions, premises and assumptions, then assess evidence quality and relevance. When reconstructing, bring in contextual factors and compare alternative explanations. For the Essay and Research Report, draft a plan that assigns wordage to each section, decide which perspectives need most space, and save time to write a reflective paragraph on how alternative views affected your conclusion. Be explicit about methodology: explain why particular methods were chosen, reflect on limitations, and describe ethical safeguards. In presentations rehearse for timing, use visuals to support rather than replace your spoken argument, and ensure your recording environment is quiet with clear audio. Always include accurate word counts, use consistent referencing, and submit required forms such as the research proposal and the Declaration of Authenticity. Finally, remain reflective and critical throughout: strong answers are not just well-informed, they are self-aware about the strength of their evidence and transparent about what further work would be needed to reach firmer conclusions.
