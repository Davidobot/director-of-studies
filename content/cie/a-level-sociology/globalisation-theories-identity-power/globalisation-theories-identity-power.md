# Globalisation: theories, identity and power (A-level Sociology Cambridge International)

## What do we mean by globalisation?
Globalisation describes the increasing interconnectedness of people, places, markets and ideas across national boundaries. It is a process with economic, cultural and political dimensions: goods and capital move more quickly and extensively than before; cultures meet, mix and sometimes clash; and political decisions at one level can have effects worldwide. For sociologists globalisation is not simply change for its own sake but a lens for understanding contemporary transformations in identity, power and inequality. Thinking sociologically means asking who benefits from these processes, how different social groups experience them, and how global flows interact with local contexts — a “glocal” perspective that links the global and the local.

## Theoretical perspectives on globalisation
There are competing sociological accounts of what globalisation is and whether it is new. Sceptics argue that what appears to be globalisation is really regional integration or intensified forms of long-standing international links; they emphasise continuity with earlier patterns such as colonial trade. Globalists and transformationalists claim instead that recent decades have produced genuinely new, thick networks of economic production, communication and cultural exchange that restructure social life. Marxist-inspired explanations focus on the global expansion of capitalist relations: multinational corporations, global supply chains and financialisation concentrate wealth and shape the world economy to benefit a small transnational capitalist class. Dependency and world-systems theories see persistent underdevelopment in many regions as the legacy of colonial patterns, where core countries extract resources and peripheral countries remain dependent. Feminist perspectives highlight how global processes are gendered, noting for example the feminisation of migration and how labour markets exploit women in low-paid care and export-oriented manufacturing. Postmodernist and cultural theorists emphasise fragmentation, hybridity and the collapse of grand narratives: globalisation creates a plurality of identities and cultural forms rather than a single homogenised global culture.

Each perspective draws attention to different mechanisms and consequences. Taken together, they equip you to explain and evaluate the complexity of globalisation: whether it homogenises or diversifies culture, whether it empowers transnational actors or reinforces state power, and whether it creates new opportunities or deepens inequalities.

## Globalisation and identity: convergence, divergence and hybridity
Globalisation affects how people see themselves and others. One common idea is cultural convergence, where global media, brands and consumer practices create similar lifestyles around the world — think of global fast-food chains, streaming platforms and fashion. Critics call this process Westernisation or cultural imperialism because Western norms and tastes often dominate. Yet globalisation also produces cultural resistance and divergence. Ethnic revitalisation and cultural defence occur when groups respond to global pressures by reaffirming local traditions and identities. Equally important is the concept of hybrid identity: people can combine elements from multiple cultural repertoires to form new, syncretic identities. Examples include diasporic communities who mix ancestral languages and customs with those of host societies, or youth cultures that blend global music styles with local political concerns.

The new media plays a particular role in identity formation. Social platforms enable transnational communities to form around interests, beliefs or experiences, creating cosmopolitan identities that cross national borders. At the same time, the same platforms can become spaces for polarisation and identity-based conflict. For sociology, the key questions are how global forces shape who we are, who we can be, and the inequalities built into those possibilities.

## Power, politics and the changing role of the state
Globalisation redistributes power. Traditional sovereignty is challenged by the rise of transnational actors: multinational corporations can shift investment between countries, supranational institutions set rules for trade and finance, and international NGOs and social movements influence policy. Institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization have become central to economic decision-making for many states. Their policies, including structural adjustment programmes in the late twentieth century, have had profound social consequences — for instance by cutting public spending in ways that affected health, education and social security.

However, the state does not simply lose power; it adapts. States negotiate trade agreements, use soft power to promote national interests, and cooperate on cross-border issues such as climate change, terrorism and public health. Globalisation can thus be seen as a rearrangement of power rather than its straightforward erosion. It also provokes political responses: some groups embrace open markets and liberal values, while others mobilise against perceived losses of control, cultural threat, or economic insecurity. The recent rise of populist and protectionist politics in several countries can be read as a backlash against aspects of globalisation, revealing its contested and uneven nature.

## Global inequalities: who gains, who loses?
One of the central sociological concerns about globalisation is its impact on inequality. Proponents argue that global trade, foreign direct investment and technological transfer can stimulate growth, reduce poverty and increase life chances, especially in rapidly developing economies. Critics point out that benefits are uneven. Historical patterns of colonialism and unequal trade relations have left structural disadvantages in many parts of the world. Multinational corporations often capture value at the top of global supply chains, while low-wage labour in periphery economies faces precarious conditions. Financial globalisation can bring capital inflows but also volatility, and conditional lending policies have sometimes constrained social investment.

Debates about global poverty also highlight the role of transnational organisations and NGOs. While some international programmes have improved access to education and health, critics question whether development strategies prioritise local needs or favour market-based solutions. Theories such as dependency, world-systems analysis and postcolonial critiques emphasise how historical and structural relationships continue to shape unequal outcomes across regions. In practice, analysing global inequality means looking at data on income, health and education, and examining how international trade, debt, aid and corporate practices interact with local politics and institutions.

## Migration and social change
Global migration is one of the most visible effects of globalisation, producing demographic change, cultural mixing and economic interdependence. People move for many reasons: push factors such as conflict, environmental degradation or lack of opportunity; and pull factors including better wages, education and safety. Migration can produce economic benefits for both sending and receiving countries. Remittances sent home by migrants often form a significant part of household incomes in origin countries; receiving countries may rely on migrant labour for industries from agriculture to healthcare.

Yet migration also generates social tensions. Host societies grapple with questions of integration, multiculturalism and social cohesion, and migrants may face discrimination, exploitation or legal precarity. The “brain drain” debate addresses the loss of skilled professionals from poorer to richer countries, while the “brain gain” perspective highlights diaspora networks that facilitate investment and knowledge transfer. Migration policies are shaped by national interests and international agreements, and they reveal the intersection of humanitarian concerns, economic needs and political calculation. Sociologists study how migration reshapes families, identities and inequalities, and how global flows are regulated through borders, treaties and enforcement agencies.

## Global crime and the challenges of regulation
Globalisation creates new opportunities for crime that cross borders and complicate control. Transnational crimes include human trafficking, drug smuggling, cybercrime, corporate malfeasance and environmental crimes such as illegal logging and wildlife trafficking. These activities exploit differences in regulation, enforcement capacity and demand across countries. Corporate wrongdoing, for example, can involve complex financial structures that shift profits to tax havens and obscure responsibility for environmental harm.

Policing global crime raises difficult questions about jurisdiction, resources and international cooperation. Organisations such as Interpol and regional courts offer mechanisms for cross-border action, but coordination is uneven and political interests influence what gets prioritised. Responses also include legal frameworks, extradition agreements and transnational investigations, yet prosecutions can be limited when powerful actors are involved or when crimes are diffuse and difficult to trace. Sociologically, global crime highlights how inequalities in power and wealth create both incentives for illicit activity and barriers to effective regulation.

## Connecting theory to contemporary examples
To bring these abstract ideas to life, think about a few concrete examples. The global supply chains of fashion brands illustrate how economic globalisation links consumers in one country to garment workers in another, raising questions about labour rights, corporate responsibility and consumer culture. The Arab Spring and later social movements show how social media and transnational networks can both mobilise and fragment political action. The migration of healthcare workers from the Philippines to wealthy countries reflects the global demand for labour and the social costs for sending communities. Climate change shows the interaction of global structures and local impacts: emissions are produced unevenly, but consequences such as extreme weather disproportionately affect poorer regions. Using current, specific examples in essays demonstrates the application of sociological theory to real-world phenomena and strengthens analysis.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on globalisation, start by making clear definitions and situating your response within a sociological framework. For short-answer questions explain key terms succinctly and give a focused example. In essay questions aim for balanced coverage: present at least two or three theoretical perspectives, apply them to contemporary examples, and evaluate their strengths and limitations. Structure each paragraph around a clear point, develop the point with explanation and evidence, and link back to the question. Use the key concepts of the course — such as inequality, power, identity and structure versus agency — to organise your argument and to show conceptual understanding. Where appropriate, compare global and local effects (the “glocal” approach) and consider counterarguments or qualifications to avoid one-sided claims. Time management is crucial: spend the first few minutes planning an essay to outline your argument and select examples, then allocate time to write and to leave a few minutes for a concise conclusion that weighs the evidence and reaches a reasoned judgement. Finally, aim to integrate empirical examples smoothly with theory rather than listing them; this demonstrates AO1 knowledge, AO2 application, and AO3 analysis and evaluation — the trio of skills examiners reward.
