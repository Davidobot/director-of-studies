# Education and inequality (class, ethnicity, gender) (A-level Sociology Cambridge International)

## The role of education in society: competing perspectives
Sociologists disagree about what education does for individuals and for society. Functionalists argue that education performs positive, integrative functions: it passes on shared norms and values, creates social solidarity and sorts people by ability to allocate roles in the economy. Education, in this view, is key to a meritocratic society in which talent and effort determine life chances. By contrast, Marxists see education as part of the ideological apparatus of capitalism: schools reproduce class inequalities, legitimise privilege and prepare a compliant workforce. The correspondence thesis argues that the organisation and relationships in school mirror those of the workplace, producing the attitudes and behaviours capitalism needs. Feminist perspectives add that education can reproduce gendered power relations, valuing masculine forms of knowledge and marginalising girls’ experiences, while New Right arguments stress market mechanisms and parental choice as solutions to perceived failings in state education. These theoretical disagreements shape how sociologists interpret evidence about attainment and produce very different prescriptions for policy.

Understanding these perspectives is essential because they frame explanations of unequal outcomes. When you discuss a pattern in attainment you should be able to show how a functionalist would interpret it, how a Marxist would critique that interpretation, and how feminists or interactionists might offer alternative readings that focus on gendered interactions or the everyday experiences of pupils.

## Education, meritocracy and social mobility
The idea that education is the “great equaliser” is central to debates about mobility. Meritocracy claims that schools give everyone an equal chance to succeed on the basis of ability and effort; qualifications then translate into social mobility. Empirical evidence, however, shows mixed results. Social background remains a powerful predictor of attainment: children from wealthier families are more likely to get higher grades and enter elite universities. Sociologists therefore ask whether education truly enables mobility, or whether it legitimates existing inequalities by celebrating individual success while obscuring structural advantages.

When assessing the meritocracy argument, consider both structural explanations and agency. Structuralists point to unequal access to resources, cultural capital and school choice as persistent barriers. Interactionists and life-course approaches emphasise how attitudes, aspirations and teacher–pupil interactions shape trajectories, allowing for some individuals to exercise agency and overcome disadvantage. For exam answers, illustrate the debate with concrete examples: differential access to private tuition, the role of free school meals as a proxy for poverty, or longitudinal studies showing how family background correlates with university entry.

## Influences on the curriculum: what is taught, and why it matters
The curriculum is not a neutral list of facts; it reflects power relations and cultural priorities. Sociologists discuss the social construction of knowledge and who decides what counts as legitimate knowledge. Claims about an ethnocentric curriculum argue that school content often privileges a dominant national or cultural perspective, marginalising minority histories and perspectives. Feminist analyses of the curriculum point to gendered content and gendered choices within subjects, while critiques from cultural capital theory argue that middle-class families are better placed to support the kind of knowledge and behaviours that schools reward.

Beyond explicit subjects, the “hidden curriculum” — the lessons learned through school routines, expectations and assessment — is central to sociological analysis. Schools teach punctuality, obedience, and attitudes to authority that may advantage some social groups more than others. The concept of cultural capital captures how tastes, language, and dispositions acquired in the home align with school expectations. In practice, curriculum debates matter because they link classroom experience to wider inequalities: who sees their culture reflected in lessons, who learns subject content that leads to lucrative careers, and who is channelled into lower-status pathways.

## Measuring achievement: intelligence, testing and bias
Discussions of educational inequality often turn to the measurement of ability. Intelligence tests and school examinations are central to selection processes, yet their validity and fairness are contested. Defining intelligence is philosophically and scientifically difficult, and sociologists point to social influences on test performance. Cultural bias in tests, the impact of socioeconomic status on early cognitive development, and the role of test preparation all undermine claims that tests purely measure innate ability.

Critically, tests operate within social contexts. The concept of stereotype threat explains how awareness of negative stereotypes can reduce the performance of members of marginalised groups. The Flynn effect shows rising test scores over time, indicating that environmental factors matter; this weakens strong genetic interpretations of IQ differences. When evaluating evidence, distinguish between the predictive utility of tests (they do predict certain outcomes) and their fairness as gatekeepers. Policy responses have included wider use of continuous assessment, contextual admissions in higher education, and compensatory programs aimed at narrowing early gaps.

## Social class and educational attainment: material, cultural and in-school factors
Class remains one of the most powerful predictors of educational outcomes. Material explanations focus on economic resources: families with higher incomes can afford private schooling, enrichment activities, better home learning environments and paid tuition, all of which support attainment. Cultural explanations emphasise differences in values, speech patterns and expectations. For example, the cultural capital thesis argues that middle-class parents transmit knowledge and behaviours that match schools’ expectations, giving their children an advantage in classroom interactions and assessments.

In-school processes also reproduce class inequalities. Labelling theory shows how teachers’ expectations can become self-fulfilling: pupils labelled as “low ability” may receive less challenging work or less attention, undermining achievement. Setting and streaming can lead to differentiated curricula and opportunities, and pupil subcultures may form in response to school structures, with some groups resisting school norms in ways that limit their attainment. Ethnographic studies of working-class boys who reject achievement as selling out illustrate how cultural resistance interacts with school processes.

Policies aimed at reducing class-based gaps include free school meals, targeted funding for disadvantaged pupils, early years intervention and compensatory education programs. When evaluating these policies, consider evidence of short-term gains versus long-term structural constraints, and whether policies address home conditions as well as school practices.

## Ethnicity and educational attainment: culture, racism and intersectionality
Patterns of attainment by ethnic group are complex and cannot be reduced to single causes. Cultural explanations point to differences in family attitudes to education, parental aspirations and community resources. Yet sociologists warn that cultural explanations risk blaming communities and ignoring structural factors such as poverty and discrimination. Institutional racism within schools and the education system can create barriers through biased assessment, lower expectations and curricula that fail to reflect diverse identities.

Intersectionality helps make sense of how ethnicity interacts with class and gender to produce different outcomes. For example, children from a given ethnic minority who are also economically disadvantaged face compounded disadvantages. Conversely, some ethnic minority groups outperform the national average in certain contexts, driven by high parental expectations and community support, showing that cultural factors can also be resources.

Policies to address ethnic inequalities include anti-racist curricula, training to counter unconscious bias, bilingual support for pupils with English as an additional language, and targeted outreach. When analysing ethnic patterns in exam answers, avoid simplistic generalisations and instead present balanced explanations that consider material conditions, institutional practices and cultural factors together.

## Gender and educational attainment: changing patterns and explanations
Gender differences in education have shifted considerably over recent decades. Historically, boys tended to outperform girls in many systems, but recent patterns in many countries show girls achieving higher attainment at most levels. Sociologists offer multiple explanations: changing aspirations and opportunities for women in the labour market have increased girls’ motivation; shifts in teaching styles and assessment (such as the impact of coursework historically favouring girls) have played a role; and policy initiatives aimed at raising girls’ achievement have had an effect. Explanations for boys’ relative underachievement often refer to a “crisis of masculinity,” changes in the labour market that have reduced traditional male job prospects, and differences in literacy and classroom engagement.

In the classroom, teacher expectations and gendered interactions matter. Subjects remain gendered in uptake: girls are more likely to choose humanities and languages while boys dominate some sciences and technology fields, though these patterns are changing. Feminist critiques examine how curricula, career guidance and subject cultures reproduce gendered norms. Policies to reduce gender gaps now often focus on encouraging boys’ engagement with reading and addressing negative masculine identities, while also promoting girls’ participation in STEM through role models and targeted interventions.

When discussing gender, draw attention to variation across class and ethnicity: gendered patterns are not uniform and must be analysed in relation to other social divisions.

## Exam technique
To succeed in questions on education and inequality, structure your answers to show knowledge, application and evaluation — the three Assessment Objectives. Begin with a clear introduction that defines key concepts and outlines the approach you will take. For AO1, demonstrate secure knowledge of theories and concepts: explain what is meant by meritocracy, cultural capital, the hidden curriculum, institutional racism, and so on. For AO2, apply theory to concrete examples: use empirical findings, policy examples and contemporary issues to show how theories illuminate real patterns. For AO3, critique and compare: weigh strengths and weaknesses of explanations, consider alternative interpretations, and assess the significance of evidence or policy responses.

In essays, aim for balance. After a short definition and roadmap, develop each analytical paragraph with theory, application, and evaluation. Use comparative language: show how functionalism and Marxism offer different readings, and then test them against evidence. Include specific studies or well-known findings where appropriate to support claims, but do not let description dominate; always follow description with analysis and evaluation. Conclude by summarising the argument and offering a judgement that draws on the evidence you have discussed.

Manage time in exams by allocating minutes roughly in proportion to marks: brief answers require concise knowledge, while essays demand developed argument and evaluation. Respond precisely to command words: “describe” requires characteristics, “explain” requires reasons and mechanisms, and “evaluate” requires judgement. Finally, practise writing under timed conditions, review high-scoring answers to familiarise yourself with structure, and make sure your answers are clear, relevant and directly tied to the question asked.
