# The family: roles, diversity and social change (A-level Sociology Cambridge International)

## Introduction: what you need to know and why it matters
The family is a central institution in sociology because it shapes how people are socialised, how resources and power are distributed, and how societies reproduce themselves across generations. For A-level Sociology you need to be able to define the family and household, describe changing patterns of family life, explain a range of theoretical perspectives on the family’s functions and consequences, and evaluate these perspectives with reference to evidence and contemporary social change. Key concepts to keep in mind throughout are inequality and opportunity, power and control, socialisation and identity, and the tension between structure and human agency. Being comfortable with these ideas will help you explain both long-term patterns (for example, the decline of the extended household in industrial societies) and more recent trends (for example, the rise of cohabitation and diverse household forms).

## Theories of the family and social change
Sociological theory offers different lenses through which to see the family. Functionalist perspectives argue the family performs essential roles for individuals and society: primary socialisation of children, stabilising adult personalities, and contributing to social order and cohesion. Functionalists tend to emphasise the nuclear family as an efficient unit in modern industrial societies and sometimes discuss a “loss of functions” as other institutions (such as education or welfare) take on roles once performed by the family.

Marxist perspectives place the family within the wider capitalist system. The family is seen as serving capitalism by reproducing labour power (raising future workers), transmitting class inequality through inheritance and socialisation, and encouraging consumption to support profit-making. From this view, the family helps maintain class structures and ideological control.

Feminist approaches focus on gender relations within the family. Liberal feminists highlight gradual legal and cultural change towards equality. Radical feminists emphasise patriarchy and argue that the family is a key site of women’s oppression through domestic labour, control of sexuality and violence. Marxist or socialist feminists combine insights about capitalism and patriarchy, seeing women’s unpaid labour in the home as supporting both the reproduction of labour and male dominance.

The New Right offers a conservative critique, asserting that the nuclear family is the natural and best environment for raising children and maintaining social stability; therefore, social policies that undermine the nuclear family are criticised. Postmodernist and contemporary perspectives, however, stress diversity, choice and fluidity. They argue that family forms now reflect individualisation and greater freedom to construct relationships, producing a wide range of household arrangements rather than a single ideal type.

## Changing patterns: diversity in family and household forms
Over the last century, family life in many societies has become more diverse. Marriage rates have declined in many countries while cohabitation has increased, divorce became more common from the late twentieth century and has since stabilised in some places, and people are more likely to form reconstituted families after partnership breakdown. Household forms now include nuclear families, extended families living together or nearby, lone-parent households, single-person households, and blended families. In many contexts same-sex couples and families of choice have become more visible and legally recognised, reflecting shifts in law and public attitudes.

These changes have multiple causes. Economic shifts, such as the move from industrial to service economies and changing employment patterns, affect family formation and timing. Cultural shifts, including changing gender expectations and greater acceptance of non-marital partnerships, influence decisions about cohabitation, parenthood and marriage. Legal changes—divorce law reform, the recognition of civil partnerships, and changes to parental and employment rights—also affect family life. Finally, demography matters: longer life expectancy has made multi-generational relationships more common, while lower fertility affects household size and the role of children within families.

## Family roles, gender and power within households
Understanding how roles are organised inside families is central to the sociology of the family. Conjugal roles describe how domestic tasks and responsibilities are divided between partners. Some households follow segregated conjugal roles, where paid work and domestic work are separate and gendered, while others show joint or symmetrical roles, where partners share paid work and domestic tasks more equally. The rise of dual-earner households has changed the pattern of roles, but evidence shows that women still often carry a disproportionate share of housework and emotional labour.

Sociologists distinguish different types of domestic labour: instrumental tasks (cooking, cleaning, paid work), expressive labour (childcare, nurturing), and emotion work (managing feelings and relationships). The “double burden” or “dual burden” describes women’s simultaneous responsibilities for paid work and domestic labour; some writers add a “triple shift” to include emotional labour. Power within relationships can be analysed through decision-making, control over resources, and who does unpaid work. Explanations for persistent inequalities include gender socialisation, economic dependency, cultural expectations of masculinity and femininity, and structural factors such as the gender pay gap and inadequate childcare provisions.

Feminist perspectives offer different solutions: liberal feminism advocates legal and policy reforms to promote equality; radical feminism seeks deeper transformations of gendered power relations; Marxist feminists aim to change material structures that make women’s domestic work invisible and unpaid. In essays you should be able to compare these viewpoints and consider empirical evidence about the changing distribution of domestic tasks.

## The state, social policy and the family
The state influences family life through laws, welfare provision, taxation, housing policy and education. Social policies may support families with benefits, parental leave and childcare, or they may shape family behaviour through incentives and legal frameworks for marriage, divorce and child custody. Examples include reforms that recognise same-sex partnerships and enable adoption, policies that expand childcare provision to support working parents, or welfare regimes that affect lone-parent households differently depending on benefit levels and conditions.

Sociological analysis considers whether policy treats the family as a private unit to be left alone, as a social institution to be supported, or as a problem to be regulated. The New Right tends to argue for policies that reinforce the nuclear family, whereas social democratic approaches favour policies that reduce inequality and support diverse family forms through universal services. When evaluating policy, consider its intended and unintended consequences: for instance, generous parental leave may enable mothers to combine work and family life but, if jobs or pay protections are weak, it may also reinforce gendered labour market disadvantages.

## Childhood, ageing and intergenerational relationships
Children’s experience of family life is not fixed; sociologists stress that childhood is socially constructed and changes across time and cultures. In many industrialised societies childhood has become more protected and extended, with an emphasis on schooling and development rather than immediate economic contribution. Simultaneously, children’s roles and rights have expanded, with greater legal protection and recognition in custody and welfare debates.

Ageing and the role of grandparents are increasingly important as life expectancy rises. Grandparents can provide practical childcare, emotional support and continuity across generations; in some cultures multi-generational households remain common. However, experiences of childhood and ageing differ by social class, ethnicity and gender. Poverty, housing, and work patterns shape the resources families can invest in children and the care available to older relatives. Migration is also significant: transnational families may maintain ties across borders, creating distinct patterns of care and obligation.

## Debates and contemporary perspectives: nuclear family, diversity and social change
A long-standing debate in the sociology of the family is whether the nuclear family remains dominant or whether we are witnessing an irreversible shift toward plural family forms. Arguments for continuing dominance stress cultural norms, economic structures that favour small households, and the adaptability of the nuclear family. Arguments for diversity emphasise individualisation, the growth of choice, changing gender roles, and legal recognition of different family types. Postmodernist thinkers highlight fluid identities and family practices, while sceptics warn of over-emphasising choice and underplaying structural constraints such as poverty and discrimination.

Another important debate concerns whether family life is generally beneficial or problematic for its members. Perspectives that stress the family’s positive functions focus on emotional support, socialisation and stability. Critical perspectives draw attention to inequalities, domestic violence, and the unpaid labour that reinforces wider social systems. Successful exam answers usually address these debates by presenting balanced arguments, showing how different theoretical perspectives illuminate different aspects of family life, and using concrete examples to support claims.

## Using evidence and sociological concepts to build arguments
To answer exam questions well you must combine clear definitions and theory with relevant empirical examples and critical evaluation. Define key terms such as family, household, conjugal roles, nuclear family and diversity at the start of answers where appropriate. Use sociological concepts—socialisation, cultural capital, patriarchy, ideology, role allocation, life course—to link theory to evidence. When you bring in empirical material, be specific about trends (for example, increases in cohabitation or the growth of single-person households) and explain possible reasons rather than simply stating facts. Critically evaluate by considering strengths and limitations of theories, pointing out counter-evidence, and showing awareness of how patterns vary by context and over time. Remember to discuss inequality: how class, gender, ethnicity and age shape family experiences and opportunities.

## Exam technique
Approach each question by first making sure you understand the command word and what is being asked. For “describe” and “explain” tasks, focus on clear, well-ordered points with brief examples. For “evaluate” and longer essays, structure your answer into a clear introduction that defines terms and outlines the argument; a main body that develops points with theory and evidence and includes counter-arguments; and a conclusion that weighs up the evidence and reaches a reasoned judgement. Aim to show all three assessment skills: AO1 (knowledge and understanding) by accurately explaining perspectives and concepts; AO2 (application and interpretation) by applying theory to specific examples or recent trends; and AO3 (analysis and evaluation) by critiquing theories, addressing limitations, and comparing alternative explanations.

Plan your time in exams so you can include at least two or three evaluative points in essays. Use sociological vocabulary throughout, and where possible, vary the kinds of evidence you reference—statistical trends, legal changes, policy examples and case studies drawn from familiar contexts. Apply concepts such as structure and agency to show depth: explain how broader social forces constrain family choices and how individual actors create new family forms. Finally, practise writing concise introductions and conclusions that frame your answer and show understanding of the central debates; examiners value clarity, relevance and balanced argument.
