# Sociological perspectives and debates (A-level Sociology Cambridge International)

## Core theoretical perspectives: how sociologists explain society
Sociology is shaped by a handful of major perspectives that offer different explanations for how societies hold together, change, and reproduce inequalities. Functionalism presents society as a system of interdependent parts; education, family and religion perform functions that maintain social order and shared values. Marxism shifts the focus to class conflict, arguing that institutions serve the interests of the capitalist ruling class by reproducing labour power and ideology. Feminism highlights gender as a fundamental axis of power, critiquing both functionalist and Marxist accounts for ignoring patriarchy. The New Right takes a more conservative view, emphasising market principles and the decline of traditional institutions. Postmodernism challenges grand narratives and stresses fragmentation, fluid identities and the role of media and consumer culture. Each perspective brings different concepts—such as value consensus, cultural reproduction, hegemony, or hybridity—that are useful tools for analysing the same social phenomena from contrasting angles. For A-level work it is important not only to know what these perspectives claim, but to be able to compare them, point out strengths and limitations, and use them as lenses to interpret empirical examples.

## Structure and agency: the central sociological debate
One of the recurring debates you will encounter asks whether people are largely shaped by social structures or whether they have the capacity to act independently and create social change. Structural theories, including classical functionalism and Marxism, emphasise constraints: class, institutions and culture guide behaviour and limit choice. Action theories and interactionists, drawing on concepts like verstehen, argue that people interpret, negotiate and construct their social worlds through daily interaction. In practice, sociologists often combine insights: structures shape opportunities and norms, but individuals and groups may resist, reinterpret or transform those constraints. A useful classroom example is educational attainment. Structural explanations point to material deprivation, institutional bias and cultural capital as shaping outcomes, while agency-focused accounts examine how students form subcultures, resist labels, or use strategies to succeed. Being able to move between structure and agency in essays—showing how social forces shape patterns while allowing for human creativity and resistance—demonstrates nuanced sociological thinking.

## Inequality, power and social identity
Inequality is a theme that runs across family, education, religion, media and globalisation. Social class, gender, ethnicity and age structure life chances and identity. Sociological concepts such as social stratification, hegemony and intersectionality help explain how power operates to privilege some groups and disadvantage others. Power can be exercised through force, persuasion, ideology or institutional procedures; it can also be contested through social movements, litigation or everyday resistance. Identity is both personally felt and socially constructed: media representations, educational experiences and family socialisation shape how people see themselves and how others perceive them. Contemporary issues—such as debates on gendered divisions of labour in the household, ethnic inequalities in schooling, or ageism in media—allow students to apply theory to evidence. To sharpen analysis, always specify which dimension of inequality you are discussing and consider how different axes intersect. For example, working-class girls may experience different expectations and constraints compared with middle-class boys, producing distinct educational outcomes.

## Socialisation, the family and education: institutions, roles and change
Socialisation is the process through which individuals learn the norms, values and roles of their culture. The family, school, peer groups, religion and media are primary agents. Different theories assign different roles to these agents: functionalists argue that the family socialises children into shared norms; Marxists see the family as reproducing labour and capitalist ideology; feminists highlight how families can reproduce gender inequality. In education, debates centre on whether schooling is meritocratic or reproduces social advantage. Concepts such as cultural capital, the hidden curriculum and labelling explain how schools can reproduce class and gender inequalities even when selection appears based on merit. Changes over time—rising divorce rates, diverse family forms, changing expectations of gender roles—are often linked to broader social processes such as labour market shifts, policy changes and global cultural flows. When using examples in exams, draw on contemporary evidence where possible: national statistics, high-profile policy debates, or well-known research findings. Always relate empirical examples back to sociological theory to show the cause–effect mechanisms the theories propose.

## Globalisation, media and religion: contemporary debates and consequences
Globalisation, the new media and transformations in religiosity are examples of social change with wide-ranging consequences for identity, power and inequality. Globalisation raises questions about cultural convergence versus hybridisation: while some argue globalization leads to homogenised Western cultural forms, others highlight processes of cultural defence and local reinterpretation leading to hybrid identities. Media studies examine ownership and control, representation and effects. The growth of digital platforms has challenged traditional gatekeepers and given individuals more voice, but it has also raised concerns about misinformation, echo chambers and the power of algorithms. Theories of media effects range from direct influence models to more nuanced views of selective use and cultural effects. Religion prompts debates about secularisation versus resacralisation. Some evidence points to declining church attendance in parts of Europe, while elsewhere religion remains politically and socially powerful—examples include the political influence of evangelical movements or religion’s role in social change such as liberation theology. For exam answers, illustrate these debates with clear examples—transnational social movements, cases of global crime like human trafficking, or recent debates about platform regulation—and explain how sociological perspectives interpret their significance.

## Research methods and the evaluation of evidence
Methods are not just technicalities; they shape what sociologists can know. The distinction between quantitative and qualitative data, primary and secondary sources, and the choice of methods (surveys, experiments, ethnography, interviews, content analysis) all carry strengths and limitations. Positivist approaches favour quantitative, replicable methods aiming for objectivity and generalisability, while interpretivists favour qualitative methods that seek depth, validity and understanding of meanings. Mixed methods and triangulation combine strengths to address research questions more robustly. Ethical and practical considerations also influence research design: access, consent, risk, funding constraints and researcher bias all matter. Key evaluation criteria—validity, reliability, representativeness, objectivity and ethics—should be used consistently in essays. As a student, be ready to assess methods applied to real topics: for example, why an ethnography might be ideal for studying gang cultures but could face ethical problems, or why official statistics illuminate trends in divorce rates but might miss hidden experiences. Learn a handful of classic studies and contemporary examples to use as evidence, and practise translating methodological critique into clear implications for the trustworthiness of research findings.

## Exam technique
Success in A-level sociology relies on combining knowledge, application and evaluation. Start every essay by carefully defining key terms and setting out the argument you will develop. Aim for a clear structure: an introduction that frames the question, several analytical paragraphs that apply theory and evidence, explicit evaluative passages that weigh counter-arguments and limitations, and a concise conclusion that addresses the question directly. Use sociological perspectives to structure analysis—present one or two main theoretical positions, use empirical examples to illustrate each, and then evaluate by pointing out weaknesses or alternative explanations. Always link points back to the question and to the command word: "explain" requires causal detail; "evaluate" demands judgement and balance; "describe" asks for features and characteristics. Time management is crucial: in a 60–90 minute paper, spend the first few minutes planning, allocate time in proportion to the marks available, and reserve five minutes to proofread your conclusion. When using research methods and evidence, mention assessment criteria such as validity and representativeness to turn description into evaluation. Use named studies or clear contemporary examples to boost AO2 (application) and AO3 (analysis/evaluation), but keep the focus on answering the question rather than simply recounting facts. Finally, practise writing under timed conditions and review examiner reports or mark schemes to understand the level of detail and evaluation expected for higher marks.
