# Religion: social order, secularisation and movements (A-level Sociology Cambridge International)

Religion is a major social institution whose influence stretches across beliefs, values, identity and political life. At A‑level you will need to explain what religion is, how it helps create and sustain social order, why it sometimes stimulates social change, and why its influence appears to be changing in modern societies. You will also need to evaluate competing theories and use empirical examples to support arguments. This guide brings the key ideas together, clarifies difficult concepts, and offers examples that you can use in essays and shorter answers.

## Defining religion and measuring religiosity

Sociologists begin by recognising that religion is not a single, neat phenomenon. Definitions vary from substantive approaches that emphasise belief in the supernatural, to functional approaches that focus on the social or psychological functions religion performs, and to social constructionist views that stress how societies define and use religion. In practice you should be prepared to use a clear working definition at the start of an answer and to explain its strengths and weaknesses. Measuring religiosity is also problematic. Common indicators include belief (what people say they believe), practice (attendance at services, ritual behaviour), affiliation (self‑identified membership), and private spirituality. Each measure produces different pictures: for example, church attendance may fall in some European countries while many people still express religious identity on surveys, while in parts of the Global South regular practice and institutional membership remain high. Be ready to comment on the limitations of statistics: survey phrasing, social desirability bias, cross‑national comparability and the difference between nominal affiliation and active practice.

## Religion and social order: functionalist perspectives

Functionalist perspectives argue that religion promotes social cohesion, shared values and a sense of belonging. Religion can provide moral codes and rituals that bind people together, offering collective representations that reinforce social solidarity. Durkheim’s classic idea that rituals create collective effervescence is useful when explaining how communal worship strengthens group identity. Functionalism also sees religion as a source of meaning in times of crisis, reducing anomie and helping people accept hardship by providing moral frameworks and hopes for the future. When using this view in essays, explain what functions religion performs, give examples (for instance, funerary rites that help grieving communities, or civil religion ceremonies that sustain national identity), and evaluate by pointing out that functionalism tends to downplay conflict and the ways religion can be a source of division or social control.

## Marxist and conflict perspectives on religion

Marxist accounts offer a contrasting picture: religion is not a benign glue but an ideological tool that reproduces inequality. From this viewpoint, religion justifies social arrangements and dulls discontent by promising rewards in an afterlife, thereby helping to maintain the dominance of a ruling class. Religion is therefore part of the superstructure shaped by economic base relations and serves to legitimate exploitation. Neo‑Marxist and critical perspectives add that religion can be implicated in cultural domination and may work with other institutions to sustain capitalist interests. In evaluating Marxist arguments, consider historical and contemporary counter‑examples: religious movements have sometimes supported revolutionary change, and not all religious beliefs serve elite interests. Also note that Marxism explains continuity of religion through structural inequalities but may underplay agency and the autonomous role of religious ideas.

## Religion as a source of social change

Although some theories stress religion’s conservatism, religion can also be a powerful agent of social change. Max Weber famously argued that particular religious ideas helped create the cultural conditions for capitalism; his study of the Protestant ethic links ascetic Calvinist beliefs and a spirit of disciplined work and accumulation to the development of capitalist economic practices. Conversely, liberation theology in Latin America shows how religious ideas and organisations can mobilise the poor and challenge entrenched elites, using faith to underpin demands for social justice. Historical case studies are particularly useful: the role of Evangelical movements in US politics has shaped debates on abortion and education, while the Islamic revolutionary movement in Iran in 1979 demonstrates how religious authority can become the basis for radical political transformation. When discussing religion and change, explain the mechanisms—how beliefs translate into collective action, organisational structures that enable mobilisation, and how religion intersects with class, ethnicity and political opportunity.

## The secularisation debate: decline, transformation or resilience?

The secularisation thesis argues that modernisation, rationalisation and industrialisation reduce the social authority of religion. Classical versions predict declining belief, attendance and institutional influence as societies modernise. Evidence for decline can be found in falling church attendance in parts of Europe and in the decreasing role of religion in public institutions. However, the picture is more complex: many societies show continued or even growing religiosity, especially in the Global South, and religion may become privatised rather than disappearing. Contemporary sociologists debate whether secularisation is a universal process or whether modernity produces multiple outcomes—differentiation of institutions, privatization of belief, or religious pluralism. You should be comfortable discussing alternative explanations such as religious market theory (which sees competition increasing religious participation), the idea of multiple modernities, and empirical evidence of both decline and revival. Use comparative examples, such as the decline of traditional denominations in Western Europe alongside the growth of Pentecostalism in Latin America and Africa, to show that secularisation is not a one‑size‑fits‑all story.

## Gender, feminism and religion

Feminist perspectives question the relationship between religion and gender. Many religious traditions and institutions have historically been patriarchal: leadership roles are male‑dominated, doctrines can support gender hierarchies, and religious practices may reinforce traditional gender roles. Radical and liberal feminist critiques therefore see religion as a key site of women’s oppression. At the same time, more nuanced work recognises diversity within religion: women are often the most active participants in religious life and some religious movements provide women with community, authority within lay organisations, or resources for social change. Recent developments in several denominations and faiths—women’s ordination, reinterpretation of texts, and gender‑sensitive reforms—show movement towards greater equality, even where patriarchal structures remain. In essays, balance critique with evidence of agency: explain both how religion can contribute to gender inequality and how women use religion for empowerment.

## Religion and post‑modernity: privatisation, new religious movements and fundamentalism

Post‑modern approaches emphasise choice, diversity and the fragmentation of grand narratives. In a post‑modern context religion can become privatised: individuals pick and mix beliefs and spiritual practices in what has been called “spiritual shopping.” New religious movements (NRMs) and New Age spirituality are examples of this diversification, offering personalised spiritualities that appeal in societies where traditional institutions have lost authority. At the same time, there has been a notable rise in fundamentalist and conservative movements across world religions. Explanations for fundamentalist growth include cultural defence (religion as an identity anchor in the face of external threat), cultural transition (rapid social change producing insecurity), disengagement and marginality (socially marginal groups turning to religion for meaning), and deliberate revivalist projects. Globalisation plays a double role: it spreads religious ideas and enables transnational religious networks, which can both erode and intensify local religious identities. In answers, explain these processes, give examples such as the spread of Pentecostal networks, the growth of fundamentalist Islamist movements in some contexts, and New Age trends in affluent societies, and evaluate how far post‑modernity explains contemporary patterns of religiosity.

## Exam technique

When answering questions on religion in Paper 4, always start by clarifying your interpretation of key terms and by signalling the perspective you will use. For short‑answer questions, be precise: define, give a brief example and, if asked, offer a short evaluative comment. For a 35‑mark essay you should aim to plan for five clear paragraphs: an introduction that defines terms and outlines the argument, two to three development paragraphs that present sociological theories and apply empirical examples, at least one explicit evaluation paragraph that critically examines the arguments or evidence, and a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Balance AO1 (knowledge) with AO2 (application) and AO3 (analysis/evaluation): integrate theory with case studies (Weber, liberation theology, Evangelical politics, Iranian revolution, Pentecostal growth) and use comparative evidence where possible. When evaluating, consider internal criticisms (logical weaknesses, contradictions), empirical counter‑evidence (national or global trends that conflict with the claim), and alternative explanations (e.g. modernisation versus religious market theory). Use sociological concepts—such as secularisation, rationalisation, patriarchy, cultural defence, differentiation, and privatisation—to link ideas across paragraphs and show depth. Time management is crucial: for a 35‑mark question allocate roughly 40–45 minutes, leaving five minutes to proofread and sharpen your conclusion. Finally, practise planning answers under timed conditions and memorise a small set of strong, well‑understood examples you can adapt to different questions. These habits will help you write essays that are organised, evidence‑rich and evaluative—exactly what examiners are looking for.
