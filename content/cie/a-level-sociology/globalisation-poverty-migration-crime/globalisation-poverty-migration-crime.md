# Globalisation: poverty, migration and global crime (A-level Sociology Cambridge International)

## What is globalisation and why does it matter for sociology?
Globalisation refers to the growing interconnectedness of economies, cultures, politics and communications across the world. It has economic dimensions (growth in trade, foreign investment and transnational corporations), cultural dimensions (spread of ideas, media and lifestyles), political dimensions (global governance, human rights and international institutions) and technological dimensions (the internet, transport and communications). For sociologists globalisation matters because it reshapes identities, life chances and patterns of power. Concepts such as glocalisation (local reworking of global influences), cultural hybridisation and convergence versus divergence help us understand how people and institutions respond to global flows. Globalisation is not a single, uniform process: it creates winners and losers, opens up new opportunities for agency, and simultaneously produces new forms of structural constraint. Studying globalisation therefore brings together the key sociological concerns of inequality, power, identity and social change.

## Theoretical perspectives on globalisation
Different sociological perspectives offer contrasting interpretations of what globalisation is and who benefits from it. Marxist and neo-Marxist approaches emphasise the economic core: globalisation is an extension of capitalism, enabling transnational capital to extract profit across borders and reproduce global inequalities. From this standpoint, multinational corporations, global financial markets and neoliberal policies deepen dependence in the Global South and concentrate wealth. Feminist perspectives add a gendered lens, showing how global economic processes exploit women’s labour in export factories, migrant domestic work and informal sectors, and how patriarchal structures shape migration and trafficking. Postmodernist and cultural perspectives draw attention to the fragmentation of identities, the decline of grand narratives and the rise of choice, consumption and cultural hybridity. Sceptics argue that globalisation is overstated and that national economies and state power remain central; transformationalists occupy a middle ground, seeing globalisation as creating new structures that reconfigure but do not erase national and local agency. These theoretical frameworks are essential tools for explaining patterns of poverty, migration and crime in a global era.

## Globalisation, poverty and global inequalities
Globalisation influences poverty and inequality through multiple channels. Opening markets and foreign investment can stimulate growth and create jobs, but benefits are unevenly distributed. Trade liberalisation and the operations of transnational corporations can generate wealth while also producing precarious employment, environmental degradation and concentration of profits outside local communities. Structural mechanisms inherited from colonialism—such as unequal commodity markets and debt dependence—interact with contemporary financial structures to maintain global disparities in income, health and education. Policy responses such as structural adjustment programmes have sometimes reduced public spending on health and education, worsening life chances for the poorest. At the same time, remittances from migrants and global supply chains can provide vital income for households and spur local development. The net effect of globalisation on poverty varies by country, sector and social group: some segments experience upward mobility while others are marginalised. Critical explanations therefore emphasise the role of global capitalism, historical exploitation and patriarchal systems in producing persistent global inequalities, while more optimistic accounts point to technological diffusion, transnational activism and international aid as potential forces for improvement.

## Transnational organisations, policy responses and debates
Transnational organisations and institutions play a central role in shaping the outcomes of globalisation. Bodies such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization influence trade rules, lending conditionalities and development strategies; regional organisations and multinational policy forums coordinate economic and political responses. Non-governmental organisations and social movements also contest policies and campaign for alternative approaches. Debates about these institutions centre on credit and conditionality versus aid and capacity building, the effectiveness of market-based solutions compared with targeted social spending, and the legitimacy of decisions made by technocratic bodies. Critics argue that international organisations have historically favoured creditor interests and neoliberal reforms that benefit global capital, sometimes at the expense of social welfare. Supporters counter that trade, investment and coordinated action can deliver growth and poverty reduction when paired with sound governance. For students it is important to balance discussion of policy instruments with empirical examples: debt relief initiatives, trade agreements, microfinance projects and humanitarian interventions all illustrate the complex, contested nature of global governance.

## Global migration: causes, consequences and sociological effects
Migration is one of the most visible social effects of globalisation. People move for work, safety, family reunification, education or environmental reasons. Push factors such as conflict, poverty, environmental degradation and political repression interact with pull factors like labour demand, higher wages and social networks in destination countries. Global labour markets produce both high-skilled migration, with brain drain and brain gain effects, and low-skilled migration, supplying labour for hospitality, care and agricultural sectors. Remittances are a major economic resource for many sending countries, improving household living standards and often financing education and small enterprises. Migration also creates social consequences: diasporas bring cultural diversity, reshape identities and reconfigure gender roles within families. At the same time, migration can provoke public anxiety about scarce resources, employment competition and national identity, producing restrictive immigration policies and social tensions. Refugee crises highlight the moral and political challenges linked to asylum systems and global responsibility sharing. Sociological analysis of migration must therefore consider structural drivers, individual agency and the policies and discourses that mediate migrants’ experiences.

## Globalisation and global crime: types, causes and challenges for policing
Globalisation has facilitated new forms of crime that cross national borders and exploit global systems. Human trafficking, organised corporate crime, transnational drug networks, cybercrime and environmental offences such as illegal logging or waste dumping all illustrate criminal activities carried out at a global scale. These crimes often emerge where demand, profit and weak regulation intersect: trafficking exploits labour and sex markets; corporate crime benefits from regulatory arbitrage, complex supply chains and lax enforcement; cybercrime leverages digital networks and anonymity. Analytically, Marxist interpretations point to how elites and corporations can profit from globalised systems, while feminist analyses emphasise the gendered harms of trafficking and labour exploitation. Policing and prosecuting global crime is complicated by jurisdictional limits, differences in legal systems, corruption, and the sheer scale and sophistication of criminal networks. International cooperation—through bodies such as INTERPOL, mutual legal assistance agreements and specialised task forces—matters, but weaknesses remain, including resource inequality between states, political obstacles and technological gaps. The result is a tangled terrain where crime, regulation and global capitalism intersect, demanding both national reforms and coordinated transnational responses.

## Interconnections, resistance and contemporary issues
Poverty, migration and global crime are deeply interconnected. Economic marginalisation can push people into risky migration routes or illicit activities; migration can alter labour markets and remittance flows, which in turn shape development prospects; criminalised migration policies may fuel exploitation and trafficking networks. Climate change adds a growing dimension: environmental degradation and extreme weather events are creating new waves of displacement and intensifying competition over resources, with implications for inequality and security. Public responses range from securitisation and border fortification to humanitarianism and transnational advocacy. Social movements—such as the global justice movement, labour campaigns for supply chain accountability, and migrant rights organisations—challenge the harms produced by unregulated globalisation and press for alternatives that prioritise equity, human rights and environmental sustainability. A balanced sociological account recognises both the structural drivers that constrain choice and the range of human agency—from migrants who build diasporic identities to activists who reshape public debates—demonstrating that globalisation is contested, negotiated and continually remade.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on globalisation, poverty, migration and global crime, begin by carefully unpacking the command word: describe questions need clear definitions and features; explain questions require cause-and-effect chains; evaluate questions demand balanced argument and judgement. Always start with a brief introduction that defines key terms and outlines the approach you will take. Use relevant sociological theories explicitly: for example, apply Marxist or feminist explanations to questions about who benefits, or use postmodernist ideas when discussing identity and cultural hybridisation. Support points with contemporary examples or case studies—such as remittance economies, refugee movements, multinational corporation practices, or major trafficking scandals—to show application of theory to real-world evidence. For evaluation, present strengths and limitations of explanations, consider alternative perspectives, assess the quality of evidence, and make reasoned conclusions. Structure essays clearly with signposting paragraphs, linking back to the question throughout and ending with a concise conclusion that answers the question directly. Time-manage by allocating minutes per mark, planning essays briefly before writing, and reserving time to check and refine answers. Finally, demonstrate synoptic thinking by linking globalisation issues to other areas of the syllabus—such as class, gender, the media and the state—showing an awareness of how global processes interact with domestic and cultural structures.
