# Contract terms, unfair terms and Consumer Rights 2015 (A-level Law Cambridge International)

Understanding contract terms and the statutory controls that protect consumers is central to many problem questions at A-level. This topic asks you to distinguish different kinds of contractual statements, know how terms become part of a contract, appreciate the consequences of breach, and explain the special protection that the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA 2015) now provides for consumers alongside the older Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA). The following revision text pulls together the core rules, illustrates them with leading authorities and examples, and sets out the practical differences between business-to-business and consumer protection.

## Express terms, representations and incorporation

When parties make a contract they will often exchange statements about the subject-matter. The law separates these statements into express terms, which form part of the contract, and mere representations, which do not. Whether a statement is a term depends on the parties’ objective intentions and the circumstances of the transaction. If a statement was intended to be a contractual promise it is a term; if it was a pre-contractual statement intended to induce the contract it is usually a representation. Cases such as Bannerman v White and Routledge v McKay illustrate how courts look at timing, the relative importance attached by the parties, and whether the claimant relied on the statement when deciding to contract.

Express terms can be written or oral. If a document containing terms is signed, signature generally binds the signer regardless of whether they read the document, as in L’Estrange v Graucob. If the term is not signed, a party seeking to rely on it must show it was incorporated by reasonable notice (Parker v South Eastern Railway; Chapelton v Barry UDC) or by a consistent course of dealing. Special care is taken with onerous or unusual terms: the “red hand” principle means that particularly burdensome clauses require an even clearer notice to be incorporated (Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking; Interfoto Picture Library v Stiletto). In practice, this means a trader who relies on an uncommon exclusion or heavy penalty should put it in bold, draw attention to it and obtain actual assent.

The parol evidence rule affects how courts approach written contracts: where parties have reduced their agreement to a written document, extrinsic oral statements that contradict the writing are generally excluded from altering the contractual terms. However, the courts will still consider surrounding circumstances to determine whether a statement is a term, and statutory regimes can imply terms into written contracts.

## Implied terms and the Consumer Rights Act 2015 protections

Terms may also be implied into contracts by statute or by the courts. For consumer contracts the CRA 2015 is the primary source of implied protections. The Act implies specific terms into contracts for the supply of goods and services to ensure minimum standards where the buyer is a consumer and the seller is a trader, as defined in the Act.

For goods, the CRA implies that they must be of satisfactory quality, fit for any particular purpose made known to the trader, and as described by the trader. If these standards are breached the consumer has specific remedies under the Act: the short-term right to reject faulty goods (often referred to as the 30-day right to reject), a right to repair or replacement, and, where repair or replacement is not possible or fails, a right to a price reduction or final right to reject. For services, the Act implies a duty that services must be performed with reasonable care and skill and, when a time for performance is not fixed, within a reasonable time. Remedies for breach of the service obligations include repeat performance and the right to a price reduction.

These statutory implied terms are designed to be consumer-friendly and to shift the burden of quality onto traders. A practical example is a consumer who buys a new smartphone that arrives with a manufacturing defect: under the CRA the phone must be of satisfactory quality and the consumer can, in the short term, reject it and obtain a refund or demand repair/replacement depending on the circumstances.

## Status of terms: conditions, warranties and innominate terms

Classifying a term as a condition, warranty, or innominate term determines the remedies available on breach. Conditions are serious terms going to the root of the contract; breach of a condition gives the innocent party the right to terminate and claim damages. Warranties are collateral, less important promises; breach gives a claim for damages only. Many contractual terms are innominate: the remedy depends on the seriousness of the breach and its consequences. The classic illustrations come from commercial cases: in employment and performance contexts Poussard v Spiers (condition) and Bettini v Gye (warranty) show how courts assess importance and consequences, while Hong Kong Fir Shipping established the innominate category by focusing on the effect of a breach rather than solely on the label used by the parties.

In consumer law, the CRA’s implied terms coexist with these classifications. A breach of an implied statutory term (for example, that goods are of satisfactory quality) can give rise to the statutory remedies described earlier as well as any contractual remedies, with the statutory scheme often being the most advantageous to the consumer.

## Control of exemption and exclusion clauses: interpretation and incorporation

Exclusion and limitation clauses seek to restrict liability. The law controls such clauses by asking three questions: was the clause incorporated into the contract; is the clause worded to cover the liability in question (interpretation); and, if the clause is valid in form and construction, is it enforceable under statutory controls?

Incorporation follows the principles described earlier: signature, notice, or course of dealings. If incorporated, courts construe ambiguous wording strictly against the party relying on it (the contra proferentem rule). The Canada Steamship lines provide guidance on clauses that seek to exclude liability for negligence: if the clause expressly mentions negligence it will succeed as far as the words allow; if it does not, the court will ask whether the words are wide enough to cover negligence or whether some other head of liability is covered instead.

Even where a clause is incorporated and clearly drafted, statutory controls can prevent a party from excluding liability in certain situations. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 applies primarily to business-to-business contracts (and certain dealings with consumers where UCTA still operates) and prohibits exclusion of liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence and subjects other exclusion clauses to a reasonableness test. The statutory reasonableness test places the burden on the party seeking to rely on the clause to show it was reasonable in the circumstances at the time the contract was made. Factors that courts consider include the parties’ relative bargaining positions, whether alternative suppliers or terms were available, the extent to which the customer knew of the clause, and whether the clause was reasonably notice‑able.

For consumer contracts the CRA 2015 now provides a different and generally stronger regime. The Act requires terms to be fair and transparent; terms that create a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights to the detriment of the consumer are unfair and therefore not binding. The CRA contains specific provisions making it harder to exclude liability in consumer contracts and includes requirements of transparency. The Act also provides a non‑exhaustive list (a “grey list”) of terms which may be regarded as unfair, such as terms that allow a trader to unilaterally alter the contract without good reason or that bind the consumer to terms with which they had no real opportunity to become acquainted.

An example to bring this to life: a consumer hires a holiday cottage and the contract contains a clause excluding the owner’s liability for any injury on the premises. Under UCTA this might be ineffective if the injury results from negligence causing personal injury. Under the CRA, a clause that purports to remove the trader’s core responsibilities for safety is likely to be judged unfair and unenforceable.

## Interaction between UCTA and the Consumer Rights Act 2015

Students need to be clear about which statutory regime applies. UCTA 1977 remains important for many commercial and business-to-business contracts and for some dealings with consumers where UCTA still has effect. The CRA 2015, however, is the primary statute for contracts between traders and consumers and incorporates and modernises protections for consumers, particularly in relation to goods and services. The CRA imposes implied terms and remedies that cannot easily be excluded and applies a fairness/transparency test to contract terms, whereas UCTA’s mechanism is reasonableness. When faced with a problem scenario you should first determine whether the claimant is a consumer and the defendant a trader; if so, consider CRA provisions first and then any residual issues under UCTA where relevant.

An important practical point is that some contractual terms may be saved or modified by agreement where both parties are businesses with roughly equal bargaining power, but similar bargains imposed on a consumer will attract closer scrutiny and often be struck down as unfair or unreasonable.

## Remedies and interaction with common law

Where an express or implied term has been breached, remedies at common law and under statute overlap. For breach of contract generally the innocent party may terminate (where the term is a condition or where an innominate term’s breach has that effect) and claim damages. Under the CRA, the consumer’s statutory remedies for faulty goods include rejection, repair, replacement and price reduction. For services, statutory remedies include repeat performance and price reduction. Equitable remedies such as specific performance remain available in appropriate cases, but in consumer transactions statutory remedies are often more straightforward and consumer‑focused.

When dealing with exclusion clauses the remedies discussion should note that even if an exclusion clause prevents contractual damages, it cannot always prevent statutory remedies (for example CRA remedies) or tortious claims in all circumstances. Photo Production and subsequent authority emphasise the continuing freedom of contract in commercial contexts, but statutes limit that freedom when consumer protection or fundamental public policy issues arise.

## Teaching points and helpful examples

A useful classroom approach is to run a short fact-pattern exercise where a consumer buys a defective appliance from a retailer who supplies a standard form contract excluding liability for all defects. Ask students to identify whether the buyer is a consumer under CRA, whether the clause is incorporated and clear, and then to apply the CRA implied terms and remedies. Encourage students to contrast this with a small business purchasing the same appliance under identical terms: the analysis will invite application of UCTA and the reasonableness test, leading to a different likely outcome. Highlight the role of red-hand principles with sample clauses that are either buried in small print or prominently displayed.

When using case law, focus on the principle each case stands for rather than memorising long facts. For example, L’Estrange teaches the binding effect of signature, Interfoto warns about onerous clauses, and Hong Kong Fir illustrates the innominate term approach. For statutory sections, remember the policy behind them: CRA is consumer-protective and UCTA moderates freedom of contract in the commercial field.

## Exam technique

In problem questions begin by identifying the parties and their contractual relationship: are they trader and consumer, or two businesses? State which statutory regime applies (CRA for consumer contracts; UCTA for business contracts). Set out the relevant legal rules succinctly: whether a statement is a term, how it can be incorporated, the classification of the term, and the statutory implied protections. Apply the law to the facts step by step, considering incorporation, construction, and statutory controls in turn. Where an exclusion clause is in issue, address incorporation, interpretation (including contra proferentem and Canada Steamship principles), and statutory tests (reasonableness under UCTA or fairness/transparency under CRA). Use leading case names where they illustrate a point, but focus your answer on applying legal principles to the facts and on reaching a balanced, evidenced conclusion about remedies. Finally, when writing essays, structure your response to explain the law, evaluate its policy aims and effectiveness, and include reasoned judgment about possible reforms or tensions between consumer protection and commercial certainty.
