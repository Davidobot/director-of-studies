# Contract law: offer, acceptance and consideration (A-level Law Cambridge International)

## Overview: how contracts come into being
A legally binding contract is created when two or more parties reach agreement on essential terms, show an intention to create legal relations and exchange consideration. At A-level the primary focus is on the first building blocks of that process: offer, acceptance and consideration. Think of these as the moment-to-moment mechanics by which private promises become enforceable obligations. An offer is a definite proposal made by one party which, if accepted on the terms proposed, will form an agreement. Acceptance is the final and unqualified expression of assent to that offer; it must mirror the offer. Consideration is the price paid for a promise and is the feature that distinguishes a gratuitous promise from a contractual commitment. Together these elements form the foundation for deciding whether a court will treat a set of facts as a contract and, if so, what remedies might follow if a party breaks its promise.

## Offers: nature, categories and how they end
An offer must be distinguished from other pre-contractual communications. Where a statement is sufficiently clear, it may amount to an offer; but many business and everyday communications are only invitations to treat, asking the other party to make an offer. Common examples of invitations to treat are shop displays, adverts for goods at a stated price in a catalogue, most price notices in shops, and calls for tenders or expressions of willingness to receive offers. By contrast, an advertisement framed so that it promises a reward in return for a certain act can be an offer capable of acceptance by anyone who performs the act; the classic example is an advertisement promising a reward for information which leads to the arrest of a criminal. Offers can be bilateral, where each party promises something to the other, or unilateral, where one party promises something in return for the other party’s performance (for example, a reward for finding a lost dog).

An offer can be terminated in a number of ways before acceptance. It may be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance, but the revocation must be communicated to the offeree. It may lapse after a fixed time or after a reasonable time if no time is specified, and it will terminate on the death or incapacity of either party where acceptance would require direct interaction with the person who has died or become incapable. A counter-offer destroys the original offer: if A makes an offer and B replies with different terms, B’s reply is a rejection and a new offer that A may accept or reject. An offer also comes to an end if the subject-matter becomes illegal or is destroyed.

Certain contractual contexts produce special rules: in auctions the general rule is that an auctioneer’s call for bids is an invitation to treat and each bid is an offer; acceptance occurs when the hammer falls, unless the auction is stated to be without reserve. In tenders, the invitation to tender is usually an invitation to treat and each tender is an offer, but courts have sometimes recognised obligations when the process of inviting tenders carries implied promises (for example, to consider all conforming bids fairly), so it is important to apply the facts to the context.

## Acceptance: timing, methods and the mirror-image rule
Acceptance must be clear, unconditional and communicated to the offeror; the so-called mirror-image rule requires that acceptance corresponds precisely with the terms of the offer. Where an offeree purports to accept but adds or varies terms, the legal effect is usually rejection and the making of a counter-offer. Silence ordinarily does not amount to acceptance. The patterns of communication are important: acceptance can be expressed verbally, in writing, by conduct, or, in a unilateral contract, by performance of the required act. For example, if an offer promises a reward to anyone who performs a specified act, the person who performs that act has accepted the offer by conduct without the need to communicate acceptance in advance.

The law treats different methods of communication differently. Acceptance made in the post is effective when the letter of acceptance is posted, not when it is received; this is the postal rule and it creates certainty where the parties have chosen a non-instantaneous form of communication. However, the postal rule is an exception and does not apply to instantaneous communications such as telephone, telex or modern electronic messages. For instantaneous methods the leading approach is that acceptance is effective when and where it is received by the offeror. This raises practical issues, for example when a message is sent outside business hours: the courts have treated receipt in business hours as decisive and sometimes allowed reception to be delayed until the start of the next working day. Where a contract is concluded by conduct—such as when goods displayed on a shelf are taken to the till and paid for—the conduct of the parties may be sufficient to show acceptance and form the contract.

Standard form contracts and “battle of the forms” situations present a special problem. When each party attempts to rely on its own terms, courts look at the pattern of offers and acceptances to decide which document was last sent and accepted, or whether a contract was formed on the common terms that both sides had agreed by their conduct. The “last shot” in a commercial exchange can often determine which terms govern, but the facts determine whether the “last shot” was actually accepted.

## Consideration: value, sufficiency and common exceptions
Consideration is the exchange element that legitimises the enforcement of promises. It must be something of value in the eyes of the law and must move from the promisee; put simply, each contracting party must provide consideration unless the contract is made by deed. Consideration need not be adequate: the law does not require that the price paid must be equivalent in value to what is promised. It must, however, be sufficient: a promise to do something the law treats as worthless will not count.

Several rules about consideration cause difficulty for students. Past consideration—something done before a promise is made—generally does not qualify. If B had already done an act before A promises to pay, A’s later promise is not supported by consideration from B. Performance of an existing contractual duty owed to the promisor is not, as a rule, good consideration for a new promise; if a party merely performs what they were already contractually bound to do, there is no new bargain. However, the courts have recognised that practical benefits can amount to consideration in modification cases where the promisor gains a real practical advantage from the promisee’s performance or promise (for example, when a supplier promises extra payment to meet a difficult deadline and the other party performs); this development is used to avoid the harshness of the strict common law rule in commercial life.

Part payment of a debt raises a classic problem. The general rule is that paying less than is owed cannot amount to good consideration for the creditor’s promise to accept the lesser sum and discharge the debtor’s liability. Equity can intervene through the doctrine of promissory estoppel to prevent a creditor from insisting on full payment where the creditor has promised to accept less and the debtor has relied on that promise; but promissory estoppel is an equitable shield, not a sword: it can suspend rights but does not create a new cause of action for the promisee if no consideration exists.

Consideration can also flow from a promise to perform a duty owed to a third party; in such cases the promise to perform the duty can be good consideration if the promisor had no pre-existing obligation to that third party. Overall, consideration is a formal mechanism to show that parties have bargained; the courts will look carefully at the timing and context to decide whether the bargain is sufficient.

## Intention to create legal relations and capacity — the wider context
Even where offer, acceptance and consideration are present, a court will not enforce an agreement unless it appears that the parties intended the agreement to have legal consequences and that the parties had capacity to contract. There is a presumption that commercial agreements are intended to be legally binding, while domestic and social agreements are presumed not to be. Those presumptions can be rebutted by clear evidence to the contrary. Capacity issues most commonly arise with minors: contracts for necessaries are binding, certain beneficial contracts of service can be enforceable, and otherwise minors can often avoid contractual obligations, subject to statutory limits and equitable remedies. These doctrines are essential background because they show that agreement and consideration are necessary but not always sufficient for enforceability.

## Applying the rules to problems: common fact patterns and pitfalls
In exam scenarios you will repeatedly be asked to decide whether a contract exists and what issues arise when one party fails to perform. A useful approach is to identify first whether an offer exists, then whether that offer has been validly accepted, and finally whether there is good consideration and intention to create legal relations. For example, a shop advertisement offering a product at a price will normally be an invitation to treat, so the customer’s attempt to buy is the offer which the shop accepts at the till. An advertisement promising a reward for a specified act is different: the performance of that act (such as returning lost property) will accept the offer. Students often fall into the trap of treating every pre-contractual communication as an offer; careful attention to the context—commercial advert, catalogue, display, or reward—is decisive.

Another frequent issue is the timing of acceptance when parties use different communication media. If an offeree posts an acceptance letter but the letter is delayed and the offeror receives a revocation before learning of the acceptance, the postal rule will generally make the contract effective on posting, which can lead to unfair results; explain the rule, apply it to the facts and consider whether the parties intended post as a valid mode of acceptance. When promises are modified by later agreements, ask whether new consideration supports the modification. If there is no fresh consideration, consider whether promissory estoppel or a practical benefit approach can save the promise. Always explain legal rules, apply them step by step to the facts, and then evaluate possible outcomes and policy implications.

## Exam technique
When tackling problem questions, begin with a short introduction that identifies the legal issues: state whether you are considering offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations and capacity. Use a clear structure: for each issue, set out the legal rule in a concise sentence or two, then apply that rule to the facts with careful reference to the parties’ words and conduct, and finally reach a reasoned conclusion. Aim to interweave authoritative examples or leading case names where they illuminate the rule, but do not rely on lengthy recounting of cases. In essays, balance explanation with evaluation: explain the law, then consider its strengths, weaknesses and possible reforms, demonstrating awareness of policy and commercial realities. Manage your time by allocating marks to sections and ensuring you answer the number of questions required; use legal terminology accurately and signpost your answer with short topic sentences so the examiner can follow your analysis. Above all, apply the law to the facts—examiners reward precise application and thoughtful evaluation far more than general statements of principle.
