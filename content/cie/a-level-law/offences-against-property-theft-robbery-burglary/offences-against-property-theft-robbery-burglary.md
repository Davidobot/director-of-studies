# Offences against property: theft, robbery, burglary (A-level Law Cambridge International)

## Overview of offences against property
Offences against property are central to the criminal law because they protect one of the most basic interests of individuals and society: the right to possess and use things without unlawful interference. The Theft Act 1968 provides the statutory framework for many of these offences in England and Wales, with theft defined in s1 and related offences such as robbery and burglary created elsewhere in the Act. Understanding these offences requires careful attention to the statutory language and to the body of case law that explains how those words operate in practice. In revision it helps to keep in mind the general structure of each offence: the actus reus (what the defendant did) and the mens rea (what they meant), and how those elements can be satisfied in different factual situations.

## Theft — the statutory definition and the two-part structure
Theft is defined in s1 of the Theft Act 1968 as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. This deceptively short definition contains distinct elements which must all be proved. The actus reus comprises an appropriation and property belonging to another; the mens rea requires dishonesty and an intention to permanently deprive. When answering problem questions you should treat each element separately: first ask whether there has been an appropriation, then whether the thing taken qualifies as property belonging to another, and finally whether the defendant had the necessary mental state. The case law shows that these elements can be reached by a wide variety of factual permutations, so the law is flexible but fact-sensitive.

## Dishonesty and appropriation: how the courts decide what counts
Dishonesty and appropriation are the two most conceptually difficult parts of theft. Appropriation involves the assumption of any of the rights of the owner; this may be an ordinary taking or a more subtle interference such as selling, switching labels, or disposing of an item. The courts have repeatedly emphasised that appropriation can occur even when the owner has consented, where a right of the owner is assumed in a way not intended by that owner. Cases such as those where goods are obtained by deception or where a person accepts a valuable gift in suspicious circumstances illustrate that appropriation is a broad concept.

Dishonesty was long governed by a two-stage test which asked whether the defendant's conduct was dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people and, if so, whether the defendant realised that ordinary people would so regard it. More recently the test applied by the courts focuses on whether the defendant's conduct was dishonest by the standards of ordinary reasonable people, having first ascertained the defendant’s own view of the facts. In practice this means the fact-finding judge or jury must identify what the defendant believed about the circumstances, then judge that belief against ordinary standards to decide whether it was dishonest. When preparing answers, distinguish clearly between a defendant who genuinely (even if mistakenly) believed they had a right to the property and one who understood they were appropriating someone else’s property but simply hoped they would not be caught.

## Property, belonging to another, and intention to permanently deprive
The Theft Act defines property widely so that tangible items, money, things in action and other intangible property can all be stolen; however, certain things such as confidential information are not treated as property for the purposes of theft. The concept of "belonging to another" goes beyond legal ownership to include possession or control and any proprietary interest. Thus a person can be guilty of theft of their own physical object if another person has a superior proprietary right or lawful possession at the time; the law therefore protects possessory and proprietary interests as well as strict legal title.

The requirement of intention to permanently deprive can raise subtle factual issues. A deliberate borrowing that is intended to return the same item in undiminished condition may not amount to an intention to permanently deprive, but borrowing that treats the item as the defendant's to dispose of or that risks loss or damage can cross the line. The courts have held that dishonesty combined with treating the property as the defendant’s, or an intention to return a materially changed object or different money, can satisfy this element. When studying cases, pay attention to how courts decide whether the defendant intended that the owner be deprived permanently or whether any temporary appropriation was nonetheless equivalent to permanent deprivation.

## Robbery — theft plus force or threat: timing and immediacy
Robbery is special because it elevates a theft by the use or threat of force. Statutorily, robbery occurs where a person, in the course of committing theft, uses force on any person or puts any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force. Two points need emphasis. First, the force must be used to facilitate the theft or to enable escape; the causal relationship between the force and the theft is important. Second, the force or threat must occur immediately before or at the time of the theft; the courts have treated appropriation as a continuing act in some circumstances so that force used during an escape can still make the theft a robbery. The law requires only minimal force; a shove, a tug on a bag or even a threat that induces fear can suffice. Conversely, if there is no completed or attempted theft, or the force is unrelated to any theft, the offence of robbery is not made out. Practical examples will often turn on whether the defendant used force to overcome resistance to the taking, and on whether the theft was in progress when the force occurred.

## Burglary — entering as a trespasser with intent, or committing a further offence after entry
Burglary under s9 of the Theft Act 1968 can be committed in two principal ways. The first is entering a building or part of a building as a trespasser with the intention, at the time of entry, to steal, inflict grievous bodily harm or commit unlawful damage. The second is entering as a trespasser and then, having entered, actually committing or attempting to commit theft or inflicting grievous bodily harm. The definition therefore distinguishes the mens rea required at the point of entry from the mental state that can be formed after entry. Entry must be a substantial and effective entry, but the courts have made clear that partial or minimal entries — putting a hand through a window, or getting halfway through a window — can suffice. The notion of a "building" is interpreted broadly: inhabited houses, shops, and even some vehicles and vessels may count, and "part of a building" is important for situations such as going behind a shop counter. Aggravated burglary under s10 occurs where, during the burglary, the defendant has with them a weapon of offence, imitation firearm, or explosive, and carries with it more serious penalties. When applying burglary law, focus on whether the defendant was a trespasser, whether entry occurred, and whether the requisite intent or subsequent conduct completed the offence.

## How the offences interact, modes of trial and sentencing considerations
These three offences interact in predictable ways: theft is a basic property offence, robbery is theft plus force, and burglary is the unlawful entry that may be accompanied by theft or other crimes. A single act may give rise to several offences; for example, entering a shop and stealing goods by squeezing them past staff while using force could lead to charges for burglary and robbery, depending on timing and trespass. In terms of trial, theft and burglary can be triable either way depending on circumstances and value, while robbery is an indictable-only offence reflecting its seriousness. Sentencing takes account of factors such as the value of property taken, the level of violence or threat, the vulnerability of the victim, and the defendant’s criminal history; aggravating features like carrying a weapon or causing serious injury will push a sentence higher. Policy considerations that often arise in study include the balance between protecting property and avoiding over-criminalisation, the role of mens rea in distinguishing culpable wrongful taking from innocent mistakes, and how the courts adapt statutory language to novel factual scenarios through judicial interpretation.

## Teaching points and common pitfalls
Students commonly conflate elements of the offences or overlook the timing of mens rea. A frequent error is to assume that a theft must involve a stealthy act; in fact, the manner of taking is irrelevant so long as appropriation, dishonesty and intention to permanently deprive are present. Another pitfall is treating dishonesty as purely subjective or purely objective; careful answers explain the two-stage approach applied by the courts: determine the defendant's belief about the facts, then judge that belief against ordinary standards. With robbery, many candidates fail to emphasise the necessary link between the force and the theft; force used for reasons unrelated to a taking does not convert the conduct into robbery. For burglary, remember to consider whether the defendant entered as a trespasser and whether they formed the relevant intent at entry (s9(1)(a)) or after entry (s9(1)(b)). Using concrete hypotheticals as practice — for example a shopper who pockets a phone, a visitor who takes a tool from a shed, or a person who threatens a shop assistant to leave a till open — will sharpen your ability to spot which elements are in issue.

## Exam technique
In exams, structure is everything. Begin by defining the statutory offence in clear terms, then identify the elements you will consider. Treat actus reus and mens rea separately and apply the law to the facts point by point: identify the contested factual issue, state the relevant legal rule (including leading authorities where appropriate), apply the rule to the facts in a reasoned way, and reach a short conclusion for each element. When asked to evaluate, balance policy arguments, consistency of case law, and practicalities of proof — for example, consider whether a rule produces fair outcomes or whether it gives courts excessive discretion. Use case names to show legal knowledge but always explain the principle the case stands for, and avoid merely listing authorities without applying them. Time management matters: allocate time to the higher-mark parts of the paper, plan answers briefly before writing, and ensure each paragraph advances your argument. Practise past questions under timed conditions and review examiner reports to learn common examiner expectations; that rehearsal will convert knowledge into the exam performance you need.
