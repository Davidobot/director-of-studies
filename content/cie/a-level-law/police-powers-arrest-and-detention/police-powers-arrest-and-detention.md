# Police powers, arrest and detention (PACE) (A-level Law Cambridge International)

## Purpose and structure of PACE and the Codes of Practice
The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) sits at the centre of the law regulating how the police investigate crime in England and Wales. It was introduced to balance two competing needs: to give the police effective powers to prevent and detect crime, and to protect individuals from unfair or oppressive treatment. PACE itself sets out statutory powers and a framework for their exercise, while the Codes of Practice (often referred to simply as the PACE Codes) give practical detail about how those powers should be used day to day. The Codes are a key safeguard: although they are not primary legislation, failure to follow them can seriously weaken the prosecution’s case, and courts will take breaches into account when deciding whether evidence should be admitted. When studying PACE it helps to think of the Act and its Codes together: the Act provides the legal authority and broad limits, the Codes provide the standards and procedures designed to protect fairness and the rights of suspects.

## Stop and search: legal basis, limits and practical issues
Stop and search is one of the most visible and controversial police powers. Under PACE and its Codes (notably Code A), an officer may stop and search a person or vehicle where they have reasonable grounds to suspect they will find stolen property, offensive weapons, controlled drugs, or other items specified by statute. The requirement of “reasonable grounds” is crucial: an officer must be able to point to objective facts or information that justify their suspicion. In practice this means a mere hunch is not enough; something in the behaviour, circumstances or intelligence must plausibly connect the individual to criminality. It is also important to remember that other statutes, such as the Misuse of Drugs Act and counter‑terrorism legislation, provide specific stop and search powers with their own thresholds and procedures, which in certain situations can be broader than PACE-based powers.

Stop and search raises several important legal and social questions. Officers must identify themselves, explain the grounds for the search and record it in a manner set out in the Codes; failure to do so can lead to complaints and to evidence being treated with caution in court. Social concerns about disproportionate use of stop and search against minority groups have fuelled calls for greater transparency, improved training and better use of body-worn cameras to create an objective record of encounters.

## Arrest: grounds, the necessity test and the caution
Arrest is a significant interference with personal liberty, so PACE and the associated Code G set out strict rules. A police officer may arrest a person where they have reasonable grounds to suspect involvement in an offence and where arrest is necessary. The necessity element is a distinct legal test: arrest must be necessary for reasons such as to ascertain a suspect’s name and address, to prevent harm to the suspect or others, to prevent disappearance, to allow prompt and effective investigation, to prevent interference with evidence, or to protect a vulnerable person. If an officer can achieve the same objectives by less intrusive means — for example by asking for a suspect’s details on the street and arranging a later voluntary interview — then arrest may not be justified.

When an arrest is made the suspect must be informed promptly of the reason and given the statutory caution. The precise wording of the caution is important because it protects the suspect’s rights and affects the admissibility and use of any subsequent statements. In addition, an arrested person has the right to consult a solicitor, to have someone informed of their arrest, and to be treated with dignity. Effective revision requires that students can explain not only the statutory words but also how these protections work in practice: the caution protects against self-incrimination, access to legal advice guards against unfairness in interviews, and the notification right helps ensure transparency and support for the arrested person.

## Detention at the police station: time limits, custody procedures and vulnerable suspects
Once brought to a police station a suspect enters a tightly regulated regime. PACE and Code C set out the custody officer’s duties, the requirement to keep accurate custody records, and the procedural safeguards that apply while a person is detained. A central feature of the detention regime is the statutory time limit for holding a person without charge. In ordinary cases the initial period of detention without charge is limited; for more serious offences statutory mechanisms allow extensions, and terrorism legislation contains separate provisions that permit longer detention under judicial authorisation. The effect of these time limits is to ensure that the police either charge the suspect or bring them before a court within a reasonable and legally enforceable timeframe, thereby curbing indefinite detention.

Custody procedures cover a wide range of matters: issuing notices of rights, recording the reasons for detention, arranging medical attention where necessary, permitting legal consultation, and ensuring basic needs such as food and rest. The custody officer acts as a gatekeeper, responsible for authorising detention and safeguarding the welfare of the detainee. Particular attention is paid to juveniles and vulnerable adults: the role of the appropriate adult is central here. An appropriate adult must be present when a child or a vulnerable person is interviewed to ensure they understand the process, to facilitate communication, and to protect against unfair interrogation methods. The appropriate adult safeguard recognises that vulnerability can radically change the power balance in police questioning.

## Interviewing suspects: recording, legal advice and Codes E and F
Interviews are often decisive in criminal investigations. PACE placed special emphasis on the conduct and recording of interviews to protect both the investigatory function and the integrity of evidence. Codes E and F address the recording and conduct of interviews and the electronic recording of interviews. Modern practice increasingly requires interviews to be contemporaneously audio‑visually recorded so that courts can assess whether a statement was voluntary and reliable. Recording reduces disputes about what was said, discourages oppressive techniques and provides an accurate record for judges and juries.

Before interviews proceed, suspects should be informed of their rights, including the right to legal advice. Where a suspect requests a lawyer, the interview should generally be delayed until advice has been given or refused, unless exceptional circumstances justify proceeding. The interaction between the right to legal advice and the necessity test for interview timing is a fertile area for exam questions: students should be ready to explain when delays are reasonable and when the failure to provide access to legal advice might render a confession inadmissible.

## Searching, fingerprints and samples at the station; intimate searches and safeguards
Once at the station the police may conduct searches, take fingerprints and obtain samples in accordance with the statutory scheme and the Codes. Routine searches for weapons or evidence are regulated so that they respect privacy and dignity; intimate or strip searches are subject to stronger safeguards and usually require higher-level authorisation and the presence, where appropriate, of a same-sex officer. Fingerprints and forensic samples are powerful investigative tools; the law distinguishes between taking samples with consent, taking them under statutory power, and the uses that can be made of them. The Data Protection and Human Rights frameworks impose limits on retention and use, and there is ongoing public debate about the balance between investigative utility and privacy. For students, it is important to understand both the legal steps required to take these procedures and the policy concerns that underpin strict procedural safeguards.

## Consequences of PACE breaches: evidence and fairness
One of the most significant practical effects of PACE and its Codes is the way courts respond to breaches. Two statutory mechanisms are especially important. First, statements obtained by oppression or in circumstances that render them unreliable can be excluded under the provision that prevents confessions obtained improperly from being given in evidence. Second, the courts have a general discretion to exclude other evidence if its admission would have an adverse effect on the fairness of proceedings. This is not an automatic remedy; judges balance the seriousness of the breach against the importance of the evidence and the public interest in convicting offenders. Courts will also consider whether the breach was deliberate, whether it caused prejudice to the defendant, and whether exclusion is necessary to preserve the integrity of the trial.

These exclusionary rules are closely connected to fair trial principles under the Human Rights Act 1998. Article 6 rights require that criminal proceedings are fair, and rights to privacy under Article 8 can be engaged by intrusive searches or the retention of sensitive information. Students should be able to explain how procedural defects at the investigative stage can translate into excluded evidence at trial, and why the law therefore incentivises police to comply with PACE and the Codes.

## Wider context, criticisms and reform debates
PACE did not appear in a vacuum, and its operation is shaped by wider social and legal pressures. Criticisms of police powers centre on issues such as racial and socio-economic disparity in stop-and-search use, the potential for coercive interrogation methods, the length of pre-charge detention and the handling of vulnerable suspects. Technological changes — for example, body-worn cameras and DNA databases — have both improved accountability and raised new privacy questions. Reforms often aim to tighten safeguards, enhance transparency, and ensure better training and oversight. Students should be aware that law is not static: judicial decisions, statutory amendments, and political pressures all shape how police powers are exercised. Being able to discuss contemporary debates — for example, balancing public safety against civil liberties, or the role of independent oversight bodies — will strengthen evaluative answers in examinations.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on PACE, structure is everything. For problem questions start by identifying the legal issues raised by the facts, then state the relevant statutory provisions and the content of the applicable PACE Codes, and finally apply those rules to the facts in a reasoned way before reaching a conclusion. For essay questions aim to explain the policy behind the law, set out the statutory framework and Codes, and then move on to analyse strengths and weaknesses, supported by practical examples or hypothetical scenarios. Use clear legal terminology and, where appropriate, mention how the Human Rights Act interacts with PACE protections. Always show the links between procedure and fairness: explain why each safeguard exists and how breaches can affect admissibility. Time management is crucial: allocate roughly one third of your time to planning, one third to writing, and one third to review and refinement so you can correct inaccuracies and add brief evaluative comments. Finally, remember that examiners reward not just accurate knowledge but also clear application and thoughtful evaluation, so practise applying PACE rules to a variety of factual situations and prepare to balance description with critical judgement.
