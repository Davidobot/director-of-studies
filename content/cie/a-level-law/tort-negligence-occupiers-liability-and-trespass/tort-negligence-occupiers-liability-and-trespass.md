# Tort: negligence, occupiers' liability and trespass (A-level Law Cambridge International)

## Overview: what this area of tort covers and why it matters
The law of tort exists to allocate responsibility where one person’s conduct causes loss or harm to another, and to provide remedies where the legal threshold for liability is crossed. Three closely related areas you must master are negligence, occupiers’ liability and trespass. Negligence deals with accidental or careless harm and sets out tests for when someone owes and breaches a duty of care. Occupiers’ liability focuses on risks arising from land and premises and the special responsibilities of those who control them. Trespass protects a person’s exclusive possession of land and their bodily integrity through causes of action such as trespass to land, assault, battery and false imprisonment. These topics are practical and frequent in exam questions because they test your ability to apply legal principles to realistic scenarios, weigh policy considerations and recommend sensible outcomes.

## The tort of negligence: nature and structure
Negligence is a fault-based tort which requires the claimant to establish a sequence of elements: a duty of care owed by the defendant, breach of that duty by falling below the required standard of care, factual and legal causation linking the breach to the claimant’s loss, and that the loss was not too remote. The modern starting point for duty of care remains the neighbour principle from Donoghue v Stevenson, which asks whether the defendant must have had the claimant in mind as someone likely to be affected by their conduct. In contemporary practice the courts apply the three-part Caparo test: (1) was the harm reasonably foreseeable; (2) was there sufficient proximity between claimant and defendant; and (3) is it fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty, a stage where policy considerations often decide novel cases. This structure provides both predictability and flexibility: it captures familiar situations easily while allowing the law to refuse liability where imposing it would be inappropriate.

## Breach, standard of care and special standards
Once a duty is established, the court assesses breach by comparing the defendant’s conduct to the objective standard of the reasonable person in the defendant’s position. The reasonable person is careful, prudent and not unduly timid; cases such as Nettleship v Weston emphasise that learners are judged by the same objective standard as competent drivers. Where the defendant is a professional, the standard is whether the defendant acted in accordance with the practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of professionals (the Bolam principle), though courts may scrutinise such standards if they are unreasonable. The claimant’s particular vulnerability can increase the expected standard of care, as in Paris v Stepney, where a one-eyed employee required extra protection. Children are judged against a reasonable child of the same age, not an adult standard, and the context of the activity matters: a skilled sportsperson’s conduct will be judged against sporting norms. Breach assessment is fact-sensitive; the more foreseeable and serious the potential harm, the greater the precautions the law expects.

## Causation, remoteness and novel duty areas
Causation has two linked tests. Factual causation uses the “but for” test: but for the defendant’s breach, would the harm have occurred? If the answer is no, factual causation is satisfied, subject to problems with multiple causes where the courts apply common-sense reasoning. Legal causation requires that the defendant’s breach is a proximate cause of the harm and that there is no intervening act breaking the chain of causation (novus actus interveniens). Remoteness limits liability to losses of a kind reasonably foreseeable at the time of breach; the Wagon Mound principle emphasises foreseeability of the type of damage rather than the precise way it occurred. The law also treats certain novel duty situations with caution. Pure economic loss is generally unrecoverable in negligence except in specific circumstances such as negligent misstatement causing reliance (e.g. professional advisors). Psychiatric injury (nervous shock) is recoverable only where strict control on proximity and foreseeability is met to avoid limitless liability. Vicarious liability and joint liability are related doctrines that allocate responsibility for others’ torts—employers may be liable for employees’ torts committed in the course of employment, and multiple defendants can be jointly and severally liable in appropriate cases.

## Occupiers’ liability: the occupier’s duties to visitors and trespassers
The law recognises that those in control of premises owe duties to people who enter. The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 governs lawful visitors and imposes a common duty of care: an occupier must take reasonable care to ensure that visitors are reasonably safe for the purposes for which they are invited or permitted to be on the premises. The practical effect is fact-dependent: it may require warnings, reasonable maintenance, or restricting access to particularly hazardous areas. Children attract special protection because their inability to appreciate danger is foreseeable; the courts expect occupiers to guard against obvious attractive dangers to children. The Act also recognises occupations that involve people carrying out trades: visitors who encounter risks incidental to their trade may be expected to guard against those risks themselves.

The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 addresses unlawful visitors (trespassers). The duty here is narrower: an occupier owes a duty where they know or ought to know of the danger, have reasonable grounds to believe that trespassers are or may come into the vicinity of the danger, and the risk is such that the occupier may reasonably be expected to offer some protection. In practice this creates scope for partial protection—warnings, reasonable barriers or removal of known hazards—rather than the full suite of protections due to lawful visitors. Whether an occupier can exclude or limit liability depends on the circumstances and the statutory framework; obvious risks and voluntary acceptance can reduce an occupier’s liability, but a simple sign may not be sufficient if the danger is serious and the occupier has not taken basic precautions.

## Trespass to land and torts affecting the person
Trespass to land is an intentionally focussed tort: any unauthorised, direct and physical interference with the claimant’s exclusive possession of land is actionable per se, meaning that the claimant need not prove damage. A single step onto another’s land can amount to trespass, and the law protects possession strictly—historical cases, including Entick v Carrington, illustrate the importance courts place on protection against arbitrary interference. Remedies for trespass include nominal damages where no loss is shown, compensatory damages for actual harm, and injunctions to prevent ongoing trespass.

Torts affecting the person—assault, battery and false imprisonment—protect bodily integrity and personal liberty. Assault is an act that creates in another person a reasonable apprehension of immediate unlawful force; words or conduct may suffice if they create that expectation. Battery is the infliction of unlawful force; it need not cause injury and is actionable per se. False imprisonment requires total restraint of the claimant’s freedom of movement; partial obstruction without complete loss of liberty will not meet the threshold. These torts overlap with criminal offences but are civil causes of action with distinct remedies and burdens of proof. Consent, self-defence and necessity are important defences in these cases; in medical contexts, informed consent is often decisive.

## Defences and remedies in tort
Defences can remove or reduce a defendant’s liability. Volenti non fit injuria (consent) operates when a claimant has freely and knowingly accepted the risk; it is a complete defence where successfully established, but the courts examine consent carefully to ensure it was informed and voluntary. Contributory negligence reduces damages proportionately where the claimant’s own negligence contributed to their loss. Other defences include inevitable accident, act of God, statutory authority and necessity in limited circumstances. Remedies aim primarily to compensate the claimant. Damages seek to put the claimant in the position they would have been in but for the tort; the courts distinguish general (non-pecuniary) and special (pecuniary) losses and apply rules on causation, remoteness and mitigation. Equitable remedies such as injunctions may be available where damages are inadequate; injunctions can be prohibitory, mandatory or interlocutory, and courts exercise discretion, balancing fairness and public interest. For trespass or nuisance, injunctive relief can be powerful but may be denied where it imposes disproportionate hardship and damages are adequate.

## Key policy questions and practical implications
Underlying the development of tort law are recurring policy tensions: how to balance compensation with deterrence, how to limit indeterminate liability while protecting vulnerable claimants, and how to allocate loss fairly between parties. The courts use tests like Caparo to manage expansion of negligence and the distinction between lawful and unlawful visitors helps calibrate responsibilities in occupiers’ liability. Practically, these doctrines encourage those who control land or carry out potentially risky activities to take reasonable precautions, while recognising that not all accidents should lead to legal liability. For students, it is useful to think about how rules operate in real life: whether a warning suffices, when a business can be expected to fence off a hazard, and how foreseeability and proximity influence outcomes in negligence.

## Exam technique
In exam answers you must show all three assessment skills: accurate knowledge (AO1), clear application to the facts (AO2) and balanced evaluation (AO3). Start scenario answers by identifying the relevant cause(s) of action—negligence, occupiers’ liability or trespass—and state the legal tests or definitions precisely. For negligence, set out the duty (Caparo), standard of care, breach and causation, applying each element to the facts in turn and citing leading case principles to support your reasoning. For occupiers’ liability questions, identify whether the claimant is a lawful visitor (1957 Act) or a trespasser (1984 Act) and explain the differing scopes of duty; when discussing trespass to land, stress intention and directness rather than proof of damage. Always apply the law to the scenario before moving to evaluation. Evaluation should discuss policy considerations, possible limits to liability, and any alternative outcomes, using phrases such as “it could be argued” and “a court might refuse a duty because…”. For essays, plan a clear structure: introduction setting out the legal issue, body paragraphs that address definitions, case law, strengths and weaknesses of the law and real-world implications, and a concise conclusion that answers the question. Time management matters: in a 25-mark scenario allow time to identify issues, apply law carefully and reach a reasoned conclusion; in essays balance descriptive accuracy with critical analysis. Use correct legal terminology, refer to authoritative cases where relevant, and ensure every point you make is linked back to the question to maximise marks across AO1, AO2 and AO3.
