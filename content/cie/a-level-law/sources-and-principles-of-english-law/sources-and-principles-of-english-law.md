# Sources and principles of English law (A-level Law Cambridge International)

## Legal systems and the role of law
English law sits within the common law tradition, one of several major legal systems in the world alongside civil (codified) law, religious law and customary law. Understanding these differences helps explain how English law develops: unlike a purely codified system, common law grows through judicial decisions as well as statutes. The law of England and Wales is shaped by a dialogue between judges and Parliament, with judges developing principle through precedent and Parliament providing primary law by passing Acts. The rule of law underpins the whole system: laws should be clear, publicly known, applied equally and protect basic rights against arbitrary power. In practical terms this means legal certainty for citizens, predictable remedies for wrongs and limits on the state’s authority. The law’s relationship with morality is complex: some laws reflect moral consensus, others enforce public policy, and some are controversial because they depart from prevailing moral views. A-level study asks you to think about these relationships, and how ideas like justice, fairness, liability and effectiveness shape legal rules and institutions.

## Parliamentary law-making and reform
Parliamentary statutes are the primary source of law. The legislative process typically begins with consultation and proposals (green or white papers), proceeds through both Houses where clauses are debated and amended, and ends with Royal Assent. Parliament is sovereign in the traditional Diceyan sense: it can make or unmake any law, and no other body can override a valid Act. However, sovereignty is tempered in practice by political realities, devolution, the Human Rights Act 1998 (which requires UK courts to interpret legislation compatibly with Convention rights where possible) and, historically, by the supremacy of European Union law while the UK was a member. Law reform is often guided by the Law Commission, which examines areas of law and recommends systematic changes; its reports and draft bills are an important influence on modern statute law. When answering exam questions about statutes you should be able to describe the legislative stages, explain why Parliament might act, and assess the strengths and limits of statutory law in achieving certainty and justice.

## Delegated legislation and controls
Because Parliament cannot foresee every detail required to implement policy, primary legislation frequently delegates power to ministers, government departments or local authorities to make secondary law. Delegated legislation comes in many forms: statutory instruments, by‑laws and Orders in Council are the common varieties. These instruments allow technical or administrative details to be set out efficiently, but they raise issues of democratic accountability and legal certainty. Controls exist both in Parliament and in the courts. Parliamentary scrutiny may take the form of affirmative or negative resolution procedures, or the work of scrutiny committees; judicial control takes place through judicial review where a court can quash subordinate instruments that exceed the powers given by Parliament (ultra vires), are procedurally flawed or are irrational. Classic judicial review grounds include illegality (acting beyond the power granted), procedural impropriety and unreasonableness (the Wednesbury standard). A useful example of ultra vires is a public body acting beyond the scope set by statute; courts have frequently intervened where Ministers tried to use delegated powers to change important legal rights without proper authority.

## Statutory interpretation: rules and aids
Judges must interpret statutes when applying them to real disputes. Several approaches and rules guide interpretation. The literal rule gives words their ordinary meaning and promotes certainty, but can lead to absurd outcomes (illustrated in cases such as Whiteley v Chappell, where a literal reading produced an absurd result about impersonating a dead person). The golden rule allows a narrow modification of words to avoid such absurdity. The mischief rule looks back to the law before the statute to identify the defect Parliament intended to remedy, and the purposive approach looks to the broader purpose of the legislation and is especially prominent where human rights or EU law issues arise. Judges use intrinsic aids (the statute’s long title, preamble, schedules and interpretation sections) and extrinsic aids (previous Acts, historical materials, law reform reports and, where allowed, parliamentary materials). Pepper v Hart is a landmark authority permitting reference to Hansard in limited circumstances to resolve ambiguity. The Human Rights Act 1998 encourages a purposive approach because courts must, so far as possible, read legislation compatibly with Convention rights; this influences how judges choose interpretive techniques and often steers them away from rigid literalism.

## Judicial precedent and the doctrine of stare decisis
Common law develops through judicial decisions. The doctrine of precedent means courts follow past decisions to promote consistency and predictability. The binding part of a decision, the ratio decidendi, is what lower courts must follow; obiter dicta are comments made by judges that are persuasive but not binding. The hierarchy of courts determines binding force: decisions of superior courts bind lower ones. The House of Lords (and now the Supreme Court) historically regarded its past decisions as binding, but the Practice Statement 1966 (and the Supreme Court’s similar approach) permits departure from earlier authority in exceptional circumstances, allowing the law to adapt over time. The Court of Appeal is generally bound by its previous decisions but has limited exceptions (Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co) and may sometimes follow its own earlier rulings with caution. Persuasive sources include decisions from courts in other jurisdictions, academic commentary and authoritative tribunals. In exam answers, distinguish ratio and obiter, explain binding versus persuasive authority, and give examples of where higher courts overruled precedent to show how the law can change.

## Other sources: custom, academic writing and reform bodies
Beyond statute and precedent, English law recognises several softer sources. Longstanding customs may inform certain niche areas, and academic writing—particularly textbooks and journal articles—can be persuasive when judges seek principled analysis or clarification. Law reform bodies such as the Law Commission produce detailed recommendations that often form the basis for new statutes; their reports can be valuable when evaluating whether the law is effective or in need of change. International instruments and treaties sometimes influence domestic law: European Convention rights are directly relevant through the Human Rights Act, and historically EU law had direct effect and primacy, forcing changes in UK law (as in Factortame). In modern study you should be aware that retained EU law still affects some areas following exit from the EU, and that international obligations can shape domestic interpretation even when not directly enforceable.

## The principles in practice: rights, remedies and limits of power
The syllabus emphasises key concepts such as rights, duties, liability, justice and the limits of power. These principles emerge across the legal system. Rights and liabilities are protected and enforced through civil remedies such as damages and injunctions, or through criminal sanctions for wrongdoing. Courts must balance competing interests: protecting individual rights while allowing effective government action. The rule of law, judicial independence and procedural safeguards (for example, fair trial rights and police powers limited by PACE codes) are practical manifestations of these principles. When assessing the law you should consider not only legal rules but also whether they achieve justice and fairness in social context, whether they are clear enough to give citizens certainty, and whether mechanisms exist to hold power to account.

## Exam technique
To perform well in exam answers start by reading the question carefully to identify the command word and the precise legal issue. For problem questions, briefly state the relevant legal principle or statute, then explain the elements of the rule before applying it to the facts and drawing a clear conclusion. Use case law and statute names to support each legal point; where a principle has exceptions, explain those and show how they affect the outcome. For essay questions, set out the main arguments, weigh strengths and weaknesses, and reach a balanced conclusion. Time management is crucial: allocate time in proportion to marks, planning short notes for each point before writing full paragraphs. Use legal vocabulary accurately—distinguish ratio from obiter, binding from persuasive authority, actus reus from mens rea, and so on. When asked to evaluate, go beyond description: assess policy implications, consider reform options, and give justified recommendations. Finally, practice past questions under timed conditions, learn landmark cases and key statutory provisions, and revise the command words so you respond at the right depth for the mark allocation.
