# Judicial precedent and court hierarchy (A-level Law Cambridge International)

## What judicial precedent is and why it matters
Judicial precedent is the system by which past judicial decisions become a source of law for future cases. When a court decides a case, it typically explains the legal principle that underpins the decision; that explanation becomes part of the body of law which judges of later cases may follow. Precedent gives the law continuity and predictability: litigants can look at earlier decisions to estimate how a court will treat their dispute, and judges can build a coherent legal framework from case to case. At the same time, precedent sits alongside statute law and other sources; Parliament remains the supreme law-making body but judges interpret and fill gaps in legislation, often creating principles by applying legal reasoning to particular facts. For students, understanding precedent is therefore central to solving problem questions: it is not enough to know the rule, you must know where it came from and whether it binds the court you are considering.

## Ratio decidendi and obiter dicta: the heart of a judgment
A clear grasp of the difference between ratio decidendi and obiter dicta is essential. The ratio decidendi is the legal principle or reasoning necessary to reach the court’s decision; it is the binding element of the judgment for lower courts. Obiter dicta are remarks or observations made by a judge that are not essential to the conclusion reached; they are persuasive but not binding. Finding the ratio can be difficult: judges often give long, discursive reasons and may address several legal points. When reading a case for revision or exam use, focus on the factual features that led the court to apply a rule and the narrow legal proposition the court said must be followed in future cases with similar facts. Obiter dicta are useful for argument and for showing how the law might develop. Famous obiter observations have later become influential foundations for change when a higher court or Parliament takes up the idea.

## The hierarchy of the courts in England and Wales
The binding force of precedent depends on the position of the court that made the decision. The structure of the courts is hierarchical. At first instance in criminal matters sit the Magistrates’ Courts and the Crown Court (for trials on indictment), while in civil work the County Courts and the High Court hear most trials. The High Court is divided into divisions that specialise in different areas of law. Above the trial courts sits the Court of Appeal, which has separate Civil and Criminal Divisions, and above that is the Supreme Court as the final appellate tribunal for most domestic appeals. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final appeal court for certain Commonwealth and Crown dependencies; its decisions are highly persuasive in England and Wales but are not binding on the Supreme Court. In practice, decisions of superior courts bind lower courts: a decision of the Supreme Court binds the Court of Appeal and every court below; a decision of the Court of Appeal binds the High Court, County Courts and Magistrates’ Courts in most circumstances. Understanding where a judgment sits in this hierarchy is the first step in deciding whether it must be followed or may be departed from.

## Binding precedent versus persuasive precedent
Not all past decisions have equal force. Binding precedent means a lower court must follow the legal principle laid down by a higher court when the material facts are sufficiently similar. Persuasive precedent, by contrast, can influence but does not oblige. Persuasive sources include decisions of lower courts, decisions from courts in other jurisdictions (for example, the Privy Council or appellate courts in other common law countries), decisions of courts of the same level in some circumstances, judicial comments in obiter dicta and academic writings. When answering an exam question, identify whether a past case is binding on the court you are considering; if it is not binding, explain its persuasive value and why a judge might adopt or reject its reasoning. Sometimes the practical issue in a problem question is not the rule itself but whether the court before you can lawfully refuse to apply it.

## How courts change or avoid precedent: distinguishing, overruling and reversing
The legal system allows for development and correction. Distinguishing is the most common technique: a court refuses to apply an earlier decision because the material facts are sufficiently different, thereby preserving the earlier rule for cases where its facts apply. This is a routine judicial method for incremental change; classic textbook contrasts include domestic agreements in Balfour v Balfour, which was distinguished on its facts in Merritt v Merritt where the parties’ intentions were different. Overruling happens when a higher court decides that an earlier case (often from a lower or the same court) was wrongly decided and replaces its rule with a new one; this is how law shifts more dramatically. Reversing occurs when an appellate court in the same case overturns the decision of a lower court on appeal. Each method has particular consequences for legal certainty and fairness: distinguishing maintains stability while allowing flexibility, overruling achieves doctrinal change but risks retrospective unfairness if applied without care, and reversing corrects error in a particular litigated dispute.

## The Practice Statement and the Court of Appeal’s special position
Historically the House of Lords (now the Supreme Court) declared itself bound by its own past decisions. In 1966 the House issued the Practice Statement, acknowledging that adherence to precedent should not stand in the way of justice and that it would depart from its own previous decisions when it appeared right to do so. The modern Supreme Court preserves that freedom to depart from its own past decisions, although it does so with caution and strong reasons. The Court of Appeal occupies an unusual position: it is normally bound by its own previous decisions but has limited scope to depart in exceptional circumstances. The leading authority on this is Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co (1944), which sets out exceptions allowing the Court of Appeal not to follow an earlier Court of Appeal decision where there are conflicting previous decisions of the Court of Appeal, where the earlier decision was made per a House of Lords (now Supreme Court) decision that has been overruled, or where the earlier decision is inconsistent with a later decision of the House of Lords/Supreme Court. These rules require careful application in exam answers: explain whether an earlier Court of Appeal authority is binding or whether one of the Young exceptions applies.

## Law reporting, ratio identification and practical examples
Judgments are preserved in law reports; authoritative series such as the Weekly Law Reports (WLR) or the All England Law Reports (All ER) are standard sources students rely on. When using cases in essays and problem answers, state the case name and the legal principle in clear terms, then explain how the court derived that principle from the facts — this shows you have identified the ratio. Useful teaching examples include Donoghue v Stevenson, which established the neighbour principle and underpins modern negligence law; R v Shivpuri, where the House of Lords used the Practice Statement to overrule its earlier decision in Anderton v Ryan on impossible attempts; and Merritt v Merritt, which illustrates distinguishing domestic arrangements. Use such examples to show how precedent operates in practice: identify the ratio, say whether it binds the court in your problem, and then apply it to the facts. Where a precedent is persuasive rather than binding, explain why a court might be attracted to its reasoning (coherence, moral force, policy) or why it might decline to follow it (conflict with superior authority, undesirable consequences, factual mismatch).

## Exam technique
When you see a problem question that engages judicial precedent, begin by identifying the legal issues and the relevant authorities. State the rule from each case (the ratio) succinctly and then say whether each case is binding or merely persuasive for the court you are considering; explicitly refer to the court hierarchy to justify that status. If a binding precedent exists, discuss whether the court could avoid it by distinguishing the facts, or whether the precedent might be treated as no longer good law because of later developments or because a higher court has overruled it. If you argue for change, explain the mechanism—would the Supreme Court need to overrule an earlier principle, or could the Court of Appeal distinguish or apply a Young exception? Use case examples to support your position and apply each rule to the facts of the question: this application forms the core of AO2. For evaluation (AO3), weigh the merits of following precedent against the need for legal development. Consider the values of certainty and predictability against justice, fairness and social change; when appropriate, suggest whether the law would be better developed by judges or by Parliament. Always conclude with a clear, balanced judgment that follows logically from your analysis and state what remedy or outcome you consider most appropriate in the scenario.
