# Core beliefs: tawhid, prophethood and the afterlife (A-level Islamic Studies Cambridge International)

## Understanding the framework: belief, authority and lived religion
The study of tawhid (the oneness of God), prophethood (risalah) and the afterlife (ʾakhirah) forms the theological core of Islamic thought and provides a framework for both individual piety and communal law. These doctrines are not abstract ideas in isolation; they are rooted in the Qurʾan and the Sunnah and are interpreted through centuries of scholarship, jurisprudence and spiritual practice. For students, it is helpful to see these beliefs as interlocking: tawhid establishes who God is and how humans relate to the Divine, prophethood explains how revelation reaches humanity and supplies moral and legal guidance, and the afterlife gives moral weight and ultimate accountability to life choices. Together they shape ritual devotion, ethical norms and political theory across the Muslim world.

## Tawhid: definitions, expressions and interpretative debates
Tawhid is the central affirmation that there is one Creator, unique and without partner. This principle affects theology, worship and worldview. The Qurʾan repeatedly emphasises God’s unity and sovereignty, urging recognition of signs in creation as evidence of divine oneness. However, how anthropomorphic language in scripture is understood has led to different interpretative paths. Some traditions read such language metaphorically, stressing transcendence and seeking to preserve divine incomparability; others have taken more literalist readings, which can influence devotional imagery and legal attitudes. These differences are not merely academic: debates over the nature of God have informed theological schools and movements, from the rationalist Muʾtazilah, who emphasised divine justice and human reason, to the theological school of al-Ashʿari which sought a middle path, and to later literalist or revivalist currents. Mystical expressions of tawhid in Sufism move the discussion into the experiential realm, focusing on inner union or nearness to God through remembrance (dhikr) and ascetic practice; controversies such as the claims attributed to Mansur al‑Hallaj illustrate the tension between ecstatic mystical language and orthodox formulations.

## Prophethood and the prophetic model: Muhammad and the chain of revelation
Prophethood (risalah) explains how divine guidance reaches humanity. Prophets are human messengers tasked with communicating God’s revelation, and Muhammad is understood in Sunni and Shiʾi Islam as the final prophet. The Qurʾan and the Hadith record not only revealed texts but also the Prophet’s conduct (Sunnah), which serves as a model for ethical behaviour and communal governance. Studying Muhammad’s life—his early mission in Mecca, the Hijrah to Medina, and his multifaceted leadership as spiritual guide, legislator and military leader—reveals how prophetic example guided formation of law, community norms and personal virtue. Hadith collections stressing sincerity, repentance, perseverance, truthfulness and kindness to neighbours and parents are practical expressions of prophetic teaching: they show how internal states (niyyah, intention) and outward actions align in Islamic moral psychology. The authority of the Sunnah, alongside the Qurʾan, raises methodological questions about hadith authenticity and grading (strong versus weak narrations), which have practical consequences for belief and practice.

## The afterlife (ʾakhirah), judgement and moral accountability
Belief in the Day of Judgement and life after death is a major ethical engine in Islam. The doctrine of ʾakhirah affirms resurrection, accountability for actions, reward in Paradise and punishment in Hell, and it places human life within a teleological narrative: this-worldly actions have eternal consequences. Scriptural passages that discuss judgement and signs serve both to comfort the pious and to warn against injustice. Closely linked to the afterlife is the doctrine of qadar (divine decree) and the perennial question of free will: to what extent are human choices genuinely autonomous, and how do they interface with divine omniscience and providence? Different schools have answered this differently. The Muʾtazilah emphasised human responsibility and rational justice—arguing that divine justice requires genuine human agency—while other traditions gave greater weight to divine sovereignty. Sufi perspectives often interpret the afterlife as the culmination of the soul’s journey towards God, with spiritual stations and the possibility of deepening nearness even in this life. Shiʾi eschatology introduces unique elements such as belief in the Mahdi and the return of the Hidden Imam, which frame messianic expectations and communal hope.

## Diversity within unity: how Sunni, Shiʾi, rationalist and mystical views differ
Islamic belief is plural in interpretation even while it affirms central articles of faith. Sunni Islam has historically emphasised the community and the consensus of the companions, producing four major legal schools that differ on detail while sharing core convictions about tawhid and prophethood. Shiʾi Islam gives particular theological weight to the family of the Prophet and to the role of the Imam as a divinely guided authority, which reshapes understandings of leadership and guidance. The Muʾtazilah and rationalist approaches used reason to defend doctrines such as divine justice and human responsibility, while Ashʿari theology moderated reason with an emphasis on divine revelation and occasionalism. Sufism introduced an inward, experiential focus, reinterpreting aspects of doctrine through spiritual practice. In modern times reformist and Salafi movements have reignited debates about literalism, contextual interpretation and the role of ijtihad (independent reasoning). For students it is vital to learn not only the distinct claims of each school but the reasons these positions developed—historical, political and intellectual contexts shaped theological priorities—and to understand how differing emphases lead to distinctive practices, such as varying celebrations, devotional forms or leadership structures.

## Connecting belief to practice: ethics, rituals and law
Core beliefs inform the whole structure of Muslim life. Tawhid undergirds the emphasis on worship and moral purity; prophethood supplies the model and the texts that shape ritual forms; belief in the afterlife provides the moral incentive for justice, charity and self-restraint. This link is visible in everyday practices: the role of intention (niyyah) in ritual purity, the spiritual aims of fasting in Ramadan as both bodily discipline and inner renewal, the purification of wealth through zakat and the social solidarity entailed by pilgrimage. Differences about the authority of sources—how to weigh Qurʾan, Sunnah, consensus, analogy, local custom or reason—produce variation in legal rulings on matters such as prayer conditions, marriage and inheritance. Students should be ready to give examples showing how beliefs translate into law and lived practice: for instance, how belief in human accountability affects attitudes toward social justice, or how conceptions of God’s transcendence influence the use of calligraphy and geometric art rather than figural imagery in many Islamic artistic traditions.

## Historical and intellectual context: scripture, philosophy and science
Understanding core beliefs also requires awareness of historical developments. The early caliphates fostered environments where theology, philosophy and science interacted: translation movements, philosophical enquiry and legal codification all interacted with scriptural reading. Figures such as Al‑Khwarizmi, Ibn Sina and Al‑Ghazzali engaged with Greco‑Roman thought and with the Qurʾanic claim that God sends knowledge through revelation and signs in creation. The result was a rich intellectual tradition in which reasoned inquiry and textual exegesis coexisted, sometimes in tension. Later debates over the role of rationalism versus strict textual fidelity continue to inform contemporary discussions about how Muslims engage with modern science, pluralism and human rights. It is useful for students to illustrate these connections with specific intellectual positions—for example how philosophical critiques of prophecy or arguments about the nature of the soul affected interpretations of the afterlife—or with case studies where theological positions had clear social effects.

## Exam technique
In answering Cambridge A‑level questions on tawhid, prophethood and the afterlife you must demonstrate both clear knowledge (AO1) and careful analysis and evaluation (AO2). Start answers by defining key terms concisely and situating them within the Qurʾanic and hadith framework expected by the syllabus. Use the prescribed texts and Hadith themes: for example, show how Qurʾanic verses on freedom of belief or warnings about intoxicants relate to broader theological principles; draw on hadith themes such as sincerity, repentance or truthfulness to illustrate prophetic ethics. Where a question provides source material, refer directly to it and then broaden your answer with wider reading and context. When asked to compare or evaluate, set out contrasting views—Sunni and Shiʾi positions on leadership, Muʾtazilite and Ashʿari views on qadar, or Sufi spiritual interpretations versus legalistic approaches—and weigh strengths and weaknesses of each with evidence. For 25‑mark essays, allocate time so you have a clear introduction, two to three developed analytical paragraphs and a concluding judgement that answers the question ‘to what extent…?’ Use paragraphing to separate argument points; avoid long narrative biography unless it directly supports an argument. Incorporate examples (e.g. the role of Ali in Shiʾi thought, Mansur al‑Hallaj in debates over mystical language, or the Qurʾanic emphasis on signs in creation) to illustrate abstract claims. Be precise with command words: ‘explain’ asks for reasons and relationships, ‘assess’ and ‘evaluate’ require balanced judgement, ‘compare’ requires structured contrasts and similarities. Finally, show sensitivity to diversity of opinion within Islam and conclude by linking your analysis back to how these doctrinal differences affect real lives and practices today.
