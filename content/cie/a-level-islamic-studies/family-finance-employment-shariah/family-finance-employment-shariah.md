# Family, finance and employment under shariah (A-level Islamic Studies Cambridge International)

## Understanding shariah, its sources and methodology
Shariah is the ethical and legal framework derived from God’s guidance that shapes many aspects of Muslim personal and communal life. Its primary textual sources are the Qurʾan and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), while recognised secondary methods include ijmaʿ (consensus), qiyas (analogy), and reasoned argument (ʿaql). In applied law (fiqh), jurists bring these sources together with attention to the circumstances in which the texts were revealed and the lived realities of communities. Local custom (ʿurf) and the practices of the companions (sahaba) also influence rulings. Understanding how jurists move from source texts to practical rulings is essential: different schools place different weight on secondary tools and adopt diverse methodological emphases, which explains variation in legal opinion about family arrangements, financial transactions and permissible employment.

## Principles guiding family law in Islam
Family law under shariah is grounded in a set of ethical aims that include protecting lineage, family cohesion, dignity and economic security. The Qurʾan sets out core norms—such as marriage as a contract, injunctions on fair treatment, prescribed shares in inheritance and prohibitions of injustice—that jurists must interpret. Intention (niyyah), justice and welfare (maslahah) are recurrent themes when applying rules to family matters. For example, the requirement of consent in marriage, the protection of women’s maintenance rights, and the call for equitable treatment in divorce proceedings can all be seen as expressions of these underlying principles. The objectives of shariah (maqasid), often summarised as preserving religion, life, intellect, lineage and property, provide a useful lens for evaluating family rulings and for adapting them to new contexts, such as codified family law in modern states.

## Marriage, interfaith marriage and divorce: core rules and points of debate
Marriage (nikah) is both a legal contract and a moral partnership. Under classical Sunni jurisprudence a Muslim man may traditionally marry a chaste woman from the People of the Book (Christian or Jewish), while a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man has generally been prohibited in classical formulations. The Shiʿi tradition and various schools have nuanced positions and historic practices that differ in emphasis and application. Freedom of choice and the requirement of consent are central; forced marriages are not valid in the ethical spirit of the law. Questions about relatives as spouses, polygyny, and guardianship roles are handled differently across madhahib, with some schools placing more emphasis on male guardianship and others allowing wider choices under witness and contractual protections.

Divorce (talaq) is permitted but discouraged as a last resort, and the processes and consequences vary. A husband’s pronouncement of talaq has classical forms and consequences; women’s routes to exit a marriage include khulʿ (mutual release often with compensation), judicial divorce where available, and contractual stipulations included in the marriage agreement. Modern statutory reforms in many Muslim-majority countries limit unilateral triple-talaq, provide waiting periods (ʿiddah) and allow for mediation, reflecting attempts to balance textual fidelity with protection of vulnerable spouses. When answering exam questions on marriage and divorce, it helps to distinguish between the textual bases, classical procedures, and modern legal reforms.

## Inheritance: Qurʾanic shares and interpretive issues concerning women’s rights
The Qurʾan prescribes detailed inheritance shares (for example, verses in Surah 4), and these form the backbone of Islamic inheritance law. A clear and sometimes difficult-to-explain principle is that female heirs traditionally receive half the share of male counterparts in specified relationships; jurists have justified this by reference to differing financial responsibilities historically assigned to men and women, such as obligation to provide maintenance. Application of these rules raises important contemporary discussions about fairness, economic realities and gender equality. In many modern contexts Muslims and lawmakers have sought to reconcile the Qurʾanic prescriptions with changing family economies by ensuring women receive property rights, maintenance, and contractual protections, or by encouraging wills (within the limits allowed) and family agreements to secure women’s financial positions. Different schools may vary in procedural details—such as the rights of widows, the life interest of a spouse, or the distribution among collateral relatives—so comparing two schools (for example Hanafi and Maliki, or Hanafi and a Twelver Shiʿi perspective) is useful in exam answers.

## Finance under shariah: prohibition of riba and the guiding ethics of trade
Economic activity under shariah is guided by principles that support honest trade, mutual consent, fairness and the avoidance of exploitation. Riba—commonly translated as usury or interest—is explicitly prohibited. Classical jurists interpreted riba largely to mean exploitative increases in loan contracts; modern jurists and Islamic finance scholars have developed broader analyses of riba to challenge interest-bearing loans that produce unearned profit. In response, a range of contract forms and institutions have been developed to provide banking and investment services consistent with shariah: mudarabah (profit-sharing partnerships), musharakah (joint ventures), murabaha (cost-plus sales), ijara (leasing), sukuk (asset-backed certificates) and takaful (cooperative insurance). These mechanisms aim to replace interest with risk-sharing, asset-backed transactions and clear contractual terms.

Debates remain about whether certain modern instruments replicate the economic outcome of interest despite different forms, and different schools or movements (for example reformist scholars versus conservative Salafi positions) may endorse or critique specific instruments. Mortgages are a prominent practical example: where conventional mortgages charge interest, Islamic institutions often offer murabaha-based or ijara-based home financing that avoids explicit interest but presents similar cash flows. Students should be able to explain the ethical rationale behind prohibiting riba and give concrete examples of approved alternatives while recognising ongoing jurisprudential debates.

## Employment: permissible occupations and adapting to local contexts
Employment under shariah is assessed primarily by whether the work involves permissible (halal) activities or expressly prohibited (haram) ones. Jobs that directly involve alcohol production and sale, gambling, pornography, usurious lending, or illicit goods are generally impermissible. However, real-world situations are often complex: a pharmacist dispensing alcohol-based medicine, a Muslim working in a mixed company where some products are problematic, or a professional whose employer’s business includes prohibited lines requires careful analysis. Jurists appeal to principles of necessity, intention and lesser harm to provide guidance; local custom (ʿurf), national law, and social welfare considerations shape acceptable practice. Employers’ obligations such as allowing time for prayer, permitting leave for festivals, and accommodating dietary needs are increasingly part of discussions on religious freedom and pluralism in workplaces. Students should be prepared to explain how principles like maslahah and maqasid support reasonable accommodations and the negotiation of employment ethics.

## Comparing schools of law and contemporary approaches
Differences between the four Sunni madhahib—Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʿi and Hanbali—and Shiʿi jurisprudence or modern reformist positions often show up most clearly in family and finance issues. For instance, Hanafis are typically known for methodological flexibility and the use of qiyas and ʿurf, which can lead to pragmatic rulings in commercial matters and family contracts. Maliki reliance on the practice of Medina and a strong sense of communal custom can produce distinctive positions on inheritance or guardianship. Shafiʿi methodology favours textual connections and systematic legal theory, while Hanbali positions may be more literalist. Shiʿi Twelver jurisprudence has its own sources and emphases, such as particular views on leadership and ritual, and may differ on temporary marriage (mutʿah) and some family law mechanics.

Modern reformists and Salafi thinkers represent two contemporary voices: reformists emphasise ijtihad and reinterpretation in light of modern contexts and human rights concerns, while Salafi approaches may advocate closer adherence to perceived early practices and textual literalism. When comparing positions in assessment answers, it is helpful to explain not only the different conclusions but the methodological reasons behind them, showing how differences in weighting of sources or principles (e.g. maqasid, qiyas, ʿurf) lead to divergent outcomes.

## Applying maqasid al-shariah and ijtihad to modern problems
Maqasid al-shariah—the higher objectives of the law—provide an important tool for contemporary jurists and students when considering family, finance and employment issues. By asking how a ruling serves preservation of family, property and dignity, jurists can justify reforms that uphold core values even if forms change. Ijtihad, the exercise of independent reasoning, is central for adapting rulings to new technologies and economic systems while remaining faithful to textual commitments. Examples include modern arbitration in divorce (to reduce injustice), structured Islamic finance to meet mortgage needs without riba, and workplace policies that reconcile religious obligations with secular employment rules. In exam responses, demonstrating how maqasid and ijtihad inform conclusions shows deeper understanding of both theory and practice.

## Exam technique
When answering Paper 2 questions on family, finance and employment under shariah, structure and evidence are crucial. Start by defining the legal issue and identifying the relevant textual base—cite the Qurʾan or a principle from the Sunnah where appropriate—and explain how jurists derive rulings using sources such as ijmaʿ, qiyas, ʿurf or ʿaql. For AO1 responses, focus on accurate explanation and clear presentation of rules; for AO2 responses, move beyond description to analyse differing opinions, compare two schools or positions explicitly, and assess strengths and weaknesses using principles like maqasid. Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract points: describe how a murabaha mortgage differs in form from a conventional mortgage, outline the procedural differences between talaq and khulʿ, or explain how a court might use maqasid to protect a woman’s inheritance rights in a changed economic context.

Answer planning pays dividends: spend a few minutes outlining your argument, ensuring you cover both parts of multipart questions, and balance knowledge with evaluation. When asked to ‘compare’ or ‘contrast’, give side-by-side explanations of two schools' positions and the jurisprudential reasons for each. When asked ‘to what extent’ or ‘assess’, arrive at a reasoned judgement that weighs textual authority, ethical aims and practical implications; supporting that judgement with contemporary examples or historical precedents strengthens your case. Finally, write in continuous, well‑structured prose, signpost your conclusions clearly, and where possible show awareness of ongoing debates rather than presenting a single view as definitive.
