# Qur'an: set texts and interpretation (A-level Islamic Studies Cambridge International)

The Qur'an is the primary source for Islamic belief and practice and is central to Paper 1 of this syllabus. For the purposes of the examination the specified translation is the Yusuf Ali English rendering, and the printed Qur'anic passages on the question paper will be taken from that version. Candidates are expected to understand the meaning of the key verses set for study, to relate those verses to the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), and to be able to explain how teachings drawn from those verses can be applied in the lives of Muslims today. The study combines close reading of particular ayah with attention to historical context, the Prophet’s example, and how scripture translates into ethical and communal practice.

Understanding the Qur'an means paying attention to the historical and literary context in which verses were revealed. The syllabus emphasises progressive revelation, the distinction between Meccan and Medinan material, and the role of situational context in shaping meaning. Meccan verses often focus on tawhid, the nature of revelation, and moral exhortation expressed through powerful imagery and short, emphatic statements. Medinan verses tend to address community organisation, legal matters and relationships between Muslims and others. Recognising whether a verse was revealed early or later, and whether it responds to a particular event or social need, helps to explain tone and purpose. Students should be comfortable placing each set text briefly within this framework and showing how context deepens interpretation.

The syllabus lists specific Qur'anic passages for close study; being able to paraphrase, interpret and apply each is essential. Surah 3:144 emphasises that the Prophet is a human messenger, not to be deified, and that believers must remain steadfast even if leaders change. This verse supports the Sunnah view of the Prophet as exemplar, not divine, and prompts discussion about leadership, followership and resilience in the community. Surah 4:12 deals with inheritance shares and illustrates how revelation provided concrete rules to regulate family justice; understanding this verse requires attention to the precise terms given, and to how juristic practice has explained and implemented those shares in differing circumstances. Verses 5:89–90 cover expiation for broken oaths and the prohibition of intoxicants; they are used to connect scriptural command with prophetic practice on matters of legal penalty, social welfare and moral reform.

Surah 10:99–100 contains the important principle of freedom of belief: guidance cannot be forced on the heart, and those who do not believe will have their own accountability. This helps students to think about the Qur'anic balance between da'wa and the ethical limits of coercion. Surah 13:3–4 draws attention to "signs" in creation that point to God, a theme that links Qur'anic theology with philosophical reflection and later Islamic science and natural philosophy. Surah 17:31–34 touches on several social injunctions: prohibition of killing children out of fear of poverty, protection of orphans and fairness in dealings; these verses show how revelation intervened in pre-Islamic customs and established duties of social justice. Verse 17:35 reinforces the requirement for honesty in measurement and trade, a theme that connects to the study of fiqh in Paper 2.

Surah 25:68–70 addresses core ethical prohibitions — associating partners with God, unjust killing and adultery — and immediately affirms divine mercy for those who repent, a theological balance between sin and hope that echoes frequently in the Prophet’s practice of forgiveness. Surah 31:14–15 discusses filial duties and the limits of obedience to parents when it conflicts with God-consciousness, an important area for ethical reflection and practical decisions in family life. Finally, Surah 31:17–19 exhorts believers to establish regular prayer, patience and humility, warning against arrogance, and thereby connects belief, ritual practice and character formation — a central concern of Section A of Paper 1.

Interpreting these texts requires knowledge of classical and contemporary methods of tafsir. Students should be familiar with the kinds of evidence that commentators use: linguistic analysis of the Arabic, immediate textual context within a surah, hadith and the example of the Prophet and his companions, reports of the occasion of revelation, and analogies used by jurists. Tafsir can be narrative, legal, mystical, or rationalist; awareness of these approaches helps explain why different commentators sometimes reach different conclusions on the same verse. Equally important is an understanding of the limits of translation. Even respected English renderings inevitably simplify linguistic nuances and rhetorical devices. The specification’s instruction that the printed passages will come from the Yusuf Ali translation is pragmatic: it makes the examiner’s text clear, but students should show in answers that they can think beyond the printed translation by referencing the wider meaning, the Arabic key terms where helpful, and the Sunna that illustrates the verse.

Connection between Qur'an and Sunnah is a central teaching aim of the paper. Many of the set verses are best understood in the light of prophetic actions and sayings. For example, the verses on intoxicants are reinforced by prophetic prohibitions and by the practical measures taken in Medina to limit the harmful social effects of alcohol. Verses on parental duty and on prayer are illuminated by incidents in the Prophet’s life showing how he treated his parents, his companions’ struggles to maintain prayer amid hardship, and the way that intention (niyyah) and purification practices were modelled. Candidates should be able to bring Hadith material into answers to show how the Qur'an and Sunnah operated together as moral and legal guidance, while also being aware of questions of hadith authenticity and the spectrum of hadith reliability which jurists and exegetes consider.

For students preparing to apply Qur'anic texts to modern contexts the syllabus invites thoughtful, balanced discussion. The verse on freedom of belief, for instance, is central to debates about pluralism and human rights: it can be used to argue for religious liberty while also recognising that many historical and contemporary Muslim-majority societies struggle to align practice fully with the ideal. Verses on inheritance and on financial fairness connect directly to modern questions about gender justice, economic ethics and banking practices; here students should demonstrate awareness of how juristic reasoning (ijtihad), secondary sources like qiyas and ijma', and differing school opinions (madhahib) produce a range of applied positions. Similarly, Qur'anic injunctions against injustice and mistreatment of orphans prompt discussion about welfare policy and zakat in contemporary Muslim communities.

In preparing answers, candidates should remember the examination expectations set out in the syllabus. Question 1 will present short Qur'anic and/or Hadith extracts and requires description, wider textual knowledge and structured evaluation in three parts. Other questions ask for explanation and analysis of meanings, application to contemporary life, and comparison of viewpoints where relevant. It is therefore helpful to practise writing balanced paragraphs that begin with clear explanation of a verse, proceed to exemplify its meaning with reference to the Sunnah or historical context, and then evaluate implications for the modern world. Good answers will show awareness of differences in interpretation, possible counter-arguments, and conclude with a reasoned judgement that reflects both textual fidelity and critical thinking.

Students must be careful about terminology and accuracy. When discussing the Qur'an mention surah and ayah numbers, use terms like tawhid, niyyah and ijma' correctly, and explain any Arabic words you introduce. Be precise when you link a verse to a legal ruling: indicate where the verse gives a general moral principle and where juristic elaboration is required. When bringing in Hadith, name the source collections used in the syllabus, and show understanding that hadith vary in strength and that jurists take this into account when deriving rulings. Remember also the examination instruction that although the printed passages provide the basis for Question 1, candidates are encouraged to go beyond the exact words on the paper: broader knowledge of the surah, the Prophet’s practice and subsequent interpretive tradition is expected.

Finally, approach revision in a way that combines textual familiarity with interpretive agility. Learn the content and basic meaning of each prescribed verse, practise explaining how each verse relates to the Prophet’s example and to lived Muslim practice, and work through past-question style tasks that require you to analyse differing viewpoints. Good preparation will make it possible to write answers that move confidently between AO1 knowledge and AO2 evaluation — showing both accurate understanding of texts and thoughtful, evidence-based judgments about their interpretation and application.

## Exam technique

In the exam, time management and structure matter as much as knowledge. For Question 1 use the three parts as a guide: in part (a) offer a clear, concise description of the main teaching in the printed passages; in part (b) expand your answer beyond the extract by explaining wider meaning and linking to relevant Sunnah or contextual information; in part (c) write a balanced analytical paragraph or two that weighs different interpretations, considers practical implications, and reaches a brief reasoned conclusion. For the optional questions that follow, aim to spend roughly equal time on the AO1 portion (explanation and examples) and the AO2 portion (analysis, comparison and judgement), remembering that one typically carries 10 marks and the other 15. Always make a point, support it with evidence from the Qur'an, Hadith, historical examples or scholarly positions, and then explain its significance.

Write in continuous prose with clear paragraphs. Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence that answers the question directly, then develop the point, and end with a mini-conclusion that links back to the question. Where the command word is "compare" or "contrast", ensure you treat both positions rather than focusing on one. Where the task asks you to "evaluate" or "to what extent", present a balanced argument and finish with a clear overall judgement. When you quote or paraphrase the printed Yusuf Ali translation, indicate awareness that other translations exist and, if helpful, show how the Arabic term or the wider context affects meaning. When you bring in Hadith, identify the source and be brief about its strength if that affects its use in argument.

Above all, show clarity of thought and evidence of wider reading. Examiners reward answers that combine accurate textual knowledge with critical engagement. Demonstrate the ability to explain what the verses say, how they connect to prophetic practice, and how they have been and might be applied in diverse Muslim contexts today. Conclude with a short sentence that summarises your judgement on the question asked; this gives your answer focus and leaves the examiner with a clear sense of your position.
