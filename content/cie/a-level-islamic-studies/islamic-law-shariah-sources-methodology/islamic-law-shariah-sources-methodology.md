# Islamic law (shariah): sources and methodology (A-level Islamic Studies Cambridge International)

## Overview: what is shariah and how does it relate to fiqh
Shariah is the overarching concept of divine guidance in Islam: a moral and legal vision derived from God that governs worship, personal conduct and social justice. Fiqh is the human endeavour to understand and apply that guidance; it is juristic interpretation and practical law. In other words, shariah describes the objectives and values revealed in the Qurʾan and Sunnah, while fiqh is the body of rulings produced by scholars using particular methods to address concrete questions. For students, it helps to think of shariah as the source of principles and fiqh as the process and product of reasoning about those principles. This distinction explains why there is diversity in detailed legal rulings even where there is broad agreement on foundational beliefs.

## The primary sources: Qurʾan and Sunnah
The Qurʾan and the Sunnah (the Prophet’s practice as recorded in Hadith) are the primary sources of Islamic law and take priority in legal reasoning. The Qurʾan provides commandments, prohibitions, moral principles and episodic guidance; the Sunnah supplies explanation, detail and examples of how the Prophet applied revelation. Understanding these sources requires attention to language, context and chronology. For example, the Qurʾan’s treatment of intoxicants illustrates progressive legislative development: early verses warn about harms, later verses restrict prayer while intoxicated, and a final verse prohibits intoxication outright. In the Sunnah, jurists examine the chain of transmission (isnād) and the content (matn) of hadith to assess reliability. Hadith that pass strict tests of transmission and content are classed as sound (sahih) and carry the greatest weight for legal rulings, while weak (daʿif) reports may be used with caution, especially in matters of ethics rather than binding law.

## Secondary sources and technical methods of derivation
When the Qurʾan and authentic Sunnah do not give a direct answer, Muslim jurists employ secondary sources and methodological tools. Consensus (ijmaʿ) is one such source: a unanimous agreement of qualified scholars or of the Prophet’s companions on a legal issue is regarded as authoritative in many Sunni traditions. Analogy (qiyas) extends a known ruling to a new case by identifying a common effective cause; the classical example is extending the prohibition of wine to other intoxicants because intoxication is the shared reason for prohibition. Reason ('aql) has a formal role in Shīʿī legal theory and a more debated role in Sunni practice; where used, it must be disciplined by the texts. Local custom ('urf) and the practice of the people of Medina (for Malik and the Maliki school) are also recognised as legitimate influences on law. Over time jurists developed nuanced techniques—such as istihsan (equity), maslaha (public interest) and sadd al-dhara'i (blocking means to harm)—to weigh communal welfare and prevent harm while remaining faithful to scriptural norms.

## Usul al-fiqh: principles and interpretive tools
Usul al-fiqh, the theory of Islamic jurisprudence, provides the rules scholars use to interpret texts and derive rulings. It addresses questions such as how to reconcile general and specific verses, how to treat commands of different strengths, and how to recognise abrogation (naskh), where a later text supersedes an earlier one. Language principles—literal versus figurative meanings, the scope of general terms, conditionals and exceptions—are central. Equally important are higher objectives, known as maqasid al-shariah, which classically emphasise the protection of religion, life, intellect, lineage and property. Modern jurists often appeal to maqasid to justify contextual readings and legal reform, arguing that the spirit of the law should prevail when literal application produces injustice or hardship. The balance between text and purpose is a core tension in usul: rigorous textualists stress explicit scriptural evidence, while purposive jurists allow broader reasoning to secure the law’s intended benefits.

## Schools of jurisprudence and their different methodologies
The historical development of four Sunni madhāhib—Hanafi, Maliki, Shāfiʿī and Ḥanbali—and the major Shīʿī school(s) shaped distinctive approaches to sources and methods. The Hanafis are noted for systematic use of analogy and reason, sometimes favouring juristic preference (istihsan) to avoid strict qiyas results that seem unjust. The Maliki school places special weight on the practice of the people of Medina and on public interest. The Shāfiʿī school emphasised a strict hierarchy of sources and developed usul principles that aimed to limit unrestricted personal reasoning. The Ḥanbali approach is traditionally more textualist, giving prominence to hadith collections and guarded use of analogy. Shīʿī jurisprudence, especially Twelver usul, emphasises the authority of the Ahl al‑Bayt (the Prophet’s family), grants a formal role to reason ('aql) and cultivates its own chains of transmission and principals for legal deduction. In the modern era other movements—Salafi literalists and reformist jurists—bring renewed emphasis on textual fidelity or on contextual reinterpretation respectively, leading to different legal outcomes on issues such as banking, gender roles and political authority.

## Applying methodology: examples from worship, family and finance
Methodology matters because it produces different, reasoned outcomes in concrete areas of life. In worship, jurists debate details such as the required sequence and timing of prayer, conditions for ablution and whether combining prayers is permitted under certain circumstances; these debates often turn on textual interpretation and the weight given to consensus versus local practice. Family law shows how schools differ on marriage contracts, the extent of spouses’ rights, divorce procedures and inheritance calculations. The Qurʾanic inheritance verses give principles, but their practical application requires juristic rules for calculating shares and residuary rights, and schools can diverge on technical matters. In finance, the prohibition of riba (usury) is agreed, but jurists use different methodological tools to respond to modern banking. Some argue by strict analogy that interest is riba and therefore forbidden, while others use maqasid and maslaha to construct contract forms (murabaha, mudaraba, ijara) that aim to achieve justice and economic viability within the spirit of shariah. These examples show that the same primary texts can yield a range of legitimate, historically embedded rulings depending on interpretive choices.

## Authority, reform and contemporary challenges
Two recurring questions shape contemporary discussion: who has the authority to interpret, and how should law respond to new circumstances? Classical authority rested with trained mujtahids—scholars qualified to exercise ijtihad—while ordinary believers practised taqlid (following a school). In many modern contexts juristic authority is plural: state-appointed councils, university scholars and independent muftis all produce binding or advisory opinions. Reformist voices call for reopening ijtihad to address novel issues such as bioethics, constitutionalism and gender justice; conservative voices warn against unrooted reinterpretation and urge fidelity to traditional methods. The methodological toolbox—usul, maqasid, comparative precedent, and attention to local custom—remains central in navigating these tensions, and a strong revision answer will show awareness of both the historical principles and the practical stakes of choosing one method over another.

## Exam technique
In answers, start by defining key terms—shariah, fiqh, usul al-fiqh—and state the hierarchy of sources. For AO1 questions explain the role of the Qurʾan, Sunnah and the main secondary sources, showing how scholars decide between them; use brief, accurate examples such as the progressive prohibition of alcohol or the extension of the prohibition to other intoxicants by qiyas. For AO2 responses move from explanation to evaluation: compare two schools or perspectives, identify strengths and limitations of particular methods (for example, the clarity of textualism versus the adaptability of maqasid), and reach a balanced judgement. Always link method to outcome by giving at least one concrete application in worship, family or finance to show how methodology shapes law. Structure answers with clear paragraphs: definition, explanation, example, comparison and conclusion. Manage time so that for a 25-mark question you allow time to develop an argument and a concise conclusion; for source-based or part (a) questions be sure to refer directly to the stimulus and integrate your own knowledge. Precise use of technical vocabulary (ijtihad, taqlid, ijmaʿ, qiyas, maslaha, naskh) demonstrates mastery, but always explain terms briefly so examiners can follow your line of reasoning.
