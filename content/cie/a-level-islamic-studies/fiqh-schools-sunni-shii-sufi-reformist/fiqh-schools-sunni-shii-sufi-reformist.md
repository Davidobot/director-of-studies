# Fiqh schools and diversity: Sunni, Shiʿi, Sufi and reformist views (A-level Islamic Studies Cambridge International)

## Overview: what we mean by fiqh and schools of thought
Fiqh, literally "understanding", refers to the human effort to interpret and apply God’s guidance to real life. It sits within the broader framework of shariah, the divine law as given in the Qurʾan and Sunnah. Because interpretation requires judgement, methods and priorities developed over time, producing a plurality of lawful opinions and institutionalised schools of thought, known as madhahib in the Sunni tradition and distinct jurisprudential approaches in Shiʿi, Sufi and reformist movements. Understanding these differences helps explain why Muslims in different places or communities may act differently while still seeing themselves as faithful to Islam. For A‑level study this means focusing on how sources are used, the role of religious authorities, and how schools approach practical issues such as worship, family law and finance.

## Sources and methodology: how schools derive rulings
All schools begin with the Qurʾan and the Sunnah as primary sources. Beyond these, secondary tools are used differently. Sunni jurisprudence traditionally recognises consensus (ijmaʿ) and analogy (qiyas) as key methods, while many Sunni schools also consider local custom (ʿurf) and the practice of the people of Medina. Shiʿi jurists place stronger emphasis on reason (ʿaql) and the teachings of the Imams from the Prophet’s family, and some Shiʿi traditions treat consensus differently. Reformist thinkers may prioritise the objectives of shariah (maqasid) and employ ijtihad—independent reasoning—to reinterpret texts in light of modern circumstances. Sufi practice, while not primarily a legal school, influences juristic thinking through its spiritual priorities; Sufis stress inward intention and purification, which can affect interpretation of ritual law. Recognising these methodological differences is crucial when comparing rulings on concrete issues like prayer timings, marriage, inheritance and financial transactions.

## The four main Sunni madhahib and typical differences
The four canonical Sunni madhahib—Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʿi and Hanbali—share core beliefs but differ in legal reasoning and practical rulings. The Hanafi school, historically widespread in South Asia, Turkey and parts of the Arab world, is known for its flexible use of analogy and emphasis on juristic opinion, which can produce more varied solutions to new problems. The Maliki school, historically strong in North and West Africa, gives considerable weight to the practice of the people of Medina as evidence of the Prophet’s practice. The Shafiʿi school systematised the role of hadith and developed a structured methodology that balances text and analogy, and is influential in parts of East Africa and Southeast Asia. The Hanbali school is more textualist, preferring direct reliance on Qurʾan and authentic hadith and showing reluctance to extend analogy beyond clear precedent; it underpins some contemporary conservative currents. In practical terms these differences can be seen in rulings on combining prayers, permissibility of certain financial contracts, or details of purification before prayer. When asked to compare schools, choose a clear issue (for example, inheritance shares or the permissibility of specific modern financial instruments) and show how methodological priorities lead to distinct outcomes.

## Shiʿi jurisprudence and the role of the Imam
Shiʿi legal thought, especially among the Twelver school, develops from a distinct historical and theological starting point: the centrality of the Ahl al‑Bayt (the Prophet’s family) and the idea that legitimate religious authority continues through the Imams. Twelver Shiʿism emphasises the authoritative interpretations of designated Imams and, in their absence, the role of qualified jurists (mujtahids) who exercise ijtihad. Ismaili and other Shiʿi branches have their own structures and interpretive traditions. In practice, Shiʿi jurisprudence may differ in ritual details, inheritance rules and the legal status of temporary marriage, for example. The Shiʿi approach to sources often includes a strong role for rational proof ('aql), making formal reasoning central in debates about predestination, the nature of the divine attributes and the legitimacy of certain practices. Explaining Shiʿi positions requires attention to both legal method and the religious-historical claim that leadership conveys special interpretative authority.

## Sufism: mystical priorities and their impact on practice
Sufism is not a single legal school but a spiritual movement that has shaped Muslim piety and sometimes legal interpretation. Sufis organise around tariqas (orders) with a spiritual guide (murshid) who leads disciples in practices such as dhikr (remembrance of God), ascetic exercises and moral training. The Sufi emphasis on purification of the heart, love of God, and mystical union can inform attitudes to law: legal rulings are often read through the lens of intention (niyyah) and spiritual consequence. Historical controversies, such as claims made by figures like Mansur al‑Hallaj, show how mystical language can clash with legal orthodoxy; debates about ecstatic utterances and the boundary between metaphorical and literal language are recurring themes. Sufi influence is visible in devotional practices, communal rituals and the way many communities prioritise ethical self-discipline alongside legal compliance.

## Reformist and Salafi movements: two different responses to modernity
Modern reformist thinkers and Salafi movements both critique traditional practice but with different aims. Reformists, exemplified by figures in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, argued for renewed ijtihad to adapt Islam to modern political, social and scientific realities. They often emphasise the maqasid al‑shariah (objectives of the law), argue for education and engagement with modernity, and support reinterpretations on issues like governance, legal pluralism and women's rights. Salafi or literalist currents call for returning to the sources as understood by the earliest generations and can be more skeptical of later juristic developments, sometimes rejecting taqlid (uncritical following of a madhhab). However, both reformists and Salafis are diverse internally: some reformers are conservative in social matters, and some Salafi jurists engage in careful legal reasoning. For classroom discussion, compare a reformist and a Salafi response to a contemporary issue such as banking and interest: reformists may permit modern financial instruments under principles to prevent harm and promote welfare, while some Salafi jurists seek forms of contractual avoidance of riba or new instruments that meet strict textual criteria.

## Diversity in application: examples from worship, family law and finance
Differences between schools are concrete when we examine specific areas. In worship, disputes may arise over the conditions of wudu, the permissibility of combining prayers in travel, or the correct timing of the afternoon prayer; each madhhab supplies slightly different timings and rulings based on hadith selection and analogical reasoning. In family law, questions about marriage with non‑Muslims, grounds and procedures for divorce, and the calculation of inheritance shares bring juristic diversity into everyday life; for instance, how a particular society applies rules on women’s shares in inheritance can be influenced by local custom as much as by madhhab rulings. In finance, the prohibition of riba (interest) has led to varied approaches: some jurists permit regulated banking instruments interpreted through legal maxims, others insist on strict avoidance and the design of alternative contracts. Teachers should use case studies—such as the handling of mortgages in different countries or the way mixed-faith marriages are regulated—to show students how doctrinal principles meet institutional realities.

## Interaction, change and contemporary challenges
Schools and movements do not exist in isolation; migration, state law, colonial legacies and global communication have brought different interpretations into contact. National legal systems may adopt one madhhab as official law, import a mix of opinions, or operate secular courts alongside religious courts. Fatwas from recognised authorities can cross borders through media, and reformist discourses challenge established practices. This dynamic produces contestation but also creative synthesis: hybrid practices, new fiqh councils issuing contemporary rulings, and dialogue between tradition and human rights frameworks. For students, it is important to recognise that diversity is not merely disagreement but a living response to changing social realities. Understanding how jurists justify change—by prioritising public interest, invoking doctrine, or appealing to historical precedent—equips you to evaluate claims about authenticity, continuity and reform.

## Exam technique
Exams test both knowledge (AO1) and evaluation (AO2). Start answers by defining key terms and briefly outlining the positions you will compare. When a question asks you to compare, make explicit contrasts in method and outcome: for example, show how the Hanafi use of analogy produces a different rule from the Hanbali text-based approach and explain the practical effects. Use examples to illustrate abstract points—quotation or paraphrase of a Qurʾanic verse or a hadith, reference to a named madhhab ruling, or a modern case study (such as differing national approaches to inheritance or interest). Balance description with analysis: for 10‑mark AO1 parts provide clear, accurate explanations; for 15‑mark AO2 parts develop an argument that weighs strengths and weaknesses, considers counter‑arguments and reaches a supported judgement. Structure longer answers into short paragraphs with topic sentences, use linking phrases to compare and contrast, and conclude by answering the question directly. Time management is crucial: allocate time based on marks, leave a few minutes to plan and a few to proofread. Finally, engage with the command words—’explain’, ’assess’, ’compare’, ’evaluate’—and ensure your writing matches the task: explanation for AO1, critical engagement and balanced judgement for AO2.
