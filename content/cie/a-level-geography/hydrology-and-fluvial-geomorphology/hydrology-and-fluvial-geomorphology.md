## The drainage basin as a system
A drainage basin is a natural system with inputs, stores, transfers and outputs. Precipitation is the primary input; evaporation and evapotranspiration are the main outputs. Within the basin water is stored temporarily in interception by vegetation, as surface water in puddles and lakes, in the soil (soil moisture), in groundwater aquifers and as channel storage within the river itself. Flows transfer water between these stores: overland flow and throughfall move water across or from the surface; infiltration, percolation and throughflow move water within the soil; groundwater flow moves water through permeable rock; and channel flow conveys water downstream to the basin outlet. Thinking of the basin as a system emphasises the connections between these elements and how a change in one part (for example urban paving reducing infiltration) alters flows and outputs elsewhere (higher and faster runoff and higher peak discharges).

## Hydrographs and discharge relationships
A hydrograph is the standard way to present how river discharge responds to a rainfall event. The key features are the rising limb, the peak discharge, the falling limb and the baseflow. Storm hydrographs show short-term responses to individual storms; annual hydrographs summarise seasonal variations. Two useful measures derived from hydrographs are lag time (the delay between peak rainfall and peak discharge) and the magnitude of the peak discharge itself. Short lag times and sharp peaks indicate flashy responses and high flood risk; long lag times and lower, flatter peaks indicate more attenuated flows.

Several factors influence hydrographs. Climatic factors include precipitation type and intensity and temperature, which affects evaporation and snowmelt. Antecedent moisture, the wetness of the soil before a storm, is critical because saturated soils produce much more runoff. Drainage basin characteristics also matter: small, steep, circular basins with high drainage density and impermeable geology produce rapid responses; large, elongated basins with permeable soils and vegetation cover attenuate flows. Vegetation intercepts rainfall and promotes infiltration; land use such as urbanisation increases impermeable surfaces and speeds runoff. Understanding these controls allows interpretation of hydrographs in exam questions and real-life flood analysis.

## River processes: erosion, transport and deposition
Rivers shape their channels and valleys through three linked processes: erosion, transport and deposition. Erosion occurs by processes such as hydraulic action, where moving water removes material by sheer force; abrasion (corrasion), where sediment particles scour bed and banks; solution (corrosion), where soluble minerals dissolve; and cavitation, where bubbles formed by turbulence implode and break rock. Transport of load takes four forms. Traction moves large clasts along the bed by rolling or sliding; saltation involves particles bouncing along the bed in short hops; suspension carries fine particles within the water column; and solution transports dissolved material chemically. Deposition happens when the river’s carrying capacity falls, either because velocity decreases or discharge drops; the Hjulström curve is a conceptual tool that links particle size and flow velocity to whether material will be eroded, transported or deposited, and helps explain why very fine silts require low velocities to settle while some pebbles require surprisingly high velocities to be moved.

River flow itself is complex, with laminar flow occurring in slow-moving, smooth channels and turbulent flow dominating most natural rivers. Helicoidal flow is the corkscrew pattern that helps transfer sediment laterally across bends, contributing to lateral erosion on the outer bank and deposition on the inner bank.

## Channel types and distinctive landforms
Channels develop characteristic forms—straight, braided and meandering—according to slope, sediment supply and discharge variability. Braided channels occur where a high sediment load and variable discharge lead to multiple shifting channels and bars. Meandering channels develop where finer sediments and cohesive banks, together with moderate slopes, encourage lateral erosion and point bar deposition.

Meanders produce a suite of linked landforms: river cliffs where erosion is concentrated on the outer bend, point bars where deposition builds the inner bank, oxbow lakes formed when a meander neck is cut through and isolated, and floodplains created by lateral migration and overbank deposition during floods. Riffle–pool sequences alternate shallower, faster riffles with deeper, slower pools and are a common pattern in meandering reaches. Waterfalls and gorges form where rivers flow over bands of resistant rock; the undercutting and eventual collapse of the overlying rock causes upstream retreat. Levees and floodplains are depositional features associated with overbank flows: natural levees build from coarser material near the channel; more distant fine sediments accumulate as alluvium to create extensive floodplain soils. Deltas form where rivers enter standing water and deposit sediment faster than it can be removed by waves or tides; their shapes—bird’s-foot, arcuate, cuspate—reflect the balance between river deposition, wave action and tidal redistribution. Examples such as the Mississippi (bird’s-foot) and the Nile (arcuate) illustrate these contrasts.

## Underground water and groundwater dynamics
Groundwater is a major store in many basins and contributes to baseflow, sustaining rivers between storms. The water table marks the upper surface of saturated ground; below it are aquifers where water can move through porous or fractured rock. Recharge occurs where precipitation infiltrates down to the saturated zone; springs, seepages and baseflow return groundwater to rivers. The permeability and porosity of soils and rocks determine how quickly water moves: chalk and limestone aquifers can transmit significant groundwater, whereas clays are relatively impermeable. Groundwater processes are slow compared with surface flows but are critical for long-term water supply, for supporting river flow during dry periods and for controlling the response of a basin to rainfall.

## Human impacts on catchments, channels and flood risk
Human activity modifies stores and flows at every scale. Deforestation reduces interception and increases surface runoff; afforestation increases interception and infiltration and can reduce flood peaks. Urbanisation replaces permeable surfaces with roofs and pavements, rapidly routing rainfall to drains and channels and producing flashier hydrographs. Agricultural drainage, tile drains and river straightening accelerate conveyance of water to river channels. Abstraction for irrigation and domestic supply reduces channel flow, sometimes disconnecting rivers from aquifers. Engineering interventions alter the channel itself: dams create large upstream storage that can reduce downstream peaks but may trap sediment, alter habitat and affect sediment budgets; channel straightening, embankments and culverting speed flow and can increase downstream flood risk. Levees protect local areas but can lead to higher flood levels elsewhere or cause catastrophic failure if overtopped.

Flood management therefore requires trade-offs. Structural, hard-engineering measures such as dams, levees and channelisation offer immediate protection but often at high financial and environmental cost. Soft-engineering approaches—floodplain zoning, river restoration, reforestation in upper catchments, creation of wetlands, managed flood storage and sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS)—aim to work with natural processes to reduce peak discharges, improve water quality and restore ecosystems. Effective management typically mixes approaches and must consider long-term sustainability and the interests of different stakeholders.

## Case study: a recent river flood event — Storm Desmond (December 2015)
Storm Desmond in December 2015 provides a clear example of the interaction of atmospheric conditions, basin characteristics and human factors in producing a major river flood. A deep Atlantic storm system brought prolonged, very intense rainfall to north-west England, with record totals falling on already saturated ground after weeks of wet weather. The steep topography and relatively impermeable geology of parts of Cumbria promoted rapid runoff and high river levels. Urbanisation in valley floors and constrained channel capacity in towns such as Carlisle and Keswick meant that rivers overflowed into built areas. The impacts were severe: widespread property flooding, road and rail disruption, economic losses and disruption to communities. Responses included immediate emergency measures, evacuation and rescue operations, and deployment of temporary flood defenses. In the months that followed, attention focused on both hard measures—strengthening and raising some defenses—and soft measures such as catchment reforestation, re-meandering previously straightened channels, and creating upstream storage to attenuate peak flows. The event highlights the need to consider antecedent moisture, basin response characteristics, and the role of both structural and non-structural measures in reducing future risk. When using this case study in exams, link specific causes to observed hydrograph behaviour, describe the human and environmental impacts, and evaluate the short- and long-term management responses.

## Linking theory to fieldwork and data interpretation
Hydrology lends itself to practical investigation. Simple fieldwork can measure channel cross-sections, velocity and discharge using current meters or floats, grain-size distribution from pebble counts, and water quality variables. Sketch maps and cross-sections help communicate findings in exams. Interpreting hydrographs, river long profiles and sediment graphs in the exam requires attention to axes and units, careful description of trends, and linking observed patterns to processes. Diagrams such as the storm hydrograph, the Hjulström curve and labeled sketches of meanders or a waterfall are powerful tools in answers; they must be accurate and integrated into the written explanation rather than added as decorative extras.

## Exam technique
Begin answers by quickly identifying the command word and the level of response required: define terms where requested, describe patterns when asked to, explain causes and evaluate in longer essay-style questions. For data response questions, spend a short time annotating the resource, noting key values and patterns, then plan the structure of your answer. For 30-mark structured questions, frame a clear introduction that defines key terms and outlines the approach, develop two or three well-explained points using geographical theory (for example, linking specific erosion processes to observed landforms), support these points with a named case study and specific evidence, and finish with an evaluative conclusion that weighs strengths and limitations or compares alternative management strategies. When drawing diagrams, keep them simple, label them precisely and refer to them in the text. Always integrate case study material rather than tacking it on; examiners reward synoptic links between processes, human impact and management.

Time management is essential. In a 1 hour 30 minute paper candidates will typically face shorter resource questions and one longer question; allocate time proportionally, leaving time to plan and to check your longer written responses. Use technical vocabulary accurately but avoid unnecessary jargon. Where evaluation is asked for, consider both short- and long-term consequences, environmental and social costs and benefits, and the role of scale and uncertainty. Finally, practise past papers under timed conditions, and learn one or two well-prepared, up-to-date case studies (such as Storm Desmond) that you can adapt to different questions about causes, impacts and management.
