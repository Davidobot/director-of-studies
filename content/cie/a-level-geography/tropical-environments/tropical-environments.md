# Tropical environments (A-level Geography Cambridge International)

## Introduction to tropical environments
Tropical environments encompass a wide range of climates, landforms, soils and ecosystems that exist between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. For Cambridge International A Level Geography the topic is treated as two broad types: humid tropical environments, often described as rainforests, and seasonally humid tropical environments, typically savannas. Both types share high temperatures year-round but differ greatly in the pattern and seasonality of rainfall, the dominant vegetation, and the ways in which humans interact with and manage the landscape. Understanding tropical environments means linking the atmosphere, geology and soils with living systems and human activity. Throughout this topic you should be able to explain processes (how things happen), describe characteristic landforms and ecosystems, and evaluate attempts to manage and conserve these fragile and globally important regions.

## Tropical climates: controls and characteristics
The distribution and behaviour of tropical climates are controlled by large-scale atmospheric circulation. The migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) brings a seasonal belt of low pressure and intense convectional rainfall to equatorial regions; where the ITCZ spends most of the year, humid tropical climate and rainforest develop. Subtropical anticyclones produce stable, dry conditions away from the equator and help create seasonal contrasts where the ITCZ moves away, producing pronounced dry seasons. Monsoon systems are driven by differential heating of land and sea, producing predictable wet and dry seasons in parts of South and Southeast Asia, West Africa and northern Australia. Locally, ocean currents and topography modify these broad patterns: coastal upwelling or cool currents can reduce rainfall, while orographic uplift on windward slopes amplifies it. In humid tropical zones diurnal temperature ranges are often larger than annual ranges, and evapotranspiration rates are high, creating intense moisture cycling. In seasonally humid zones, long dry seasons and frequent fires shape vegetation and soil processes.

## Landforms of tropical environments: granite and limestone landscapes
The warm, wet conditions of the tropics encourage vigorous chemical weathering and the development of distinctive landforms on both crystalline and carbonate rocks. On granite and other crystalline rocks deep chemical weathering produces thick saprolite profiles. Weathering along joints and fractures yields corestones and, over time, exposed summits that resist erosion, forming tors, bornhardts and inselbergs. These rounded rock outcrops may stand above a relatively subdued surrounding plain because of differential weathering and erosion of the weathered material.

In tropical limestone terrains dissolution is the dominant process and produces karst landscapes that are strikingly developed in humid tropics. Where joints and bedding planes are exploited by aggressive, warm, acidic rainfall, solution widening produces a variety of karst forms: cone karst with widely spaced conical hills, tower karst with steep-walled isolated pinnacles often seen in parts of Southeast Asia, and cockpit karst where a pattern of steep-sided hollows and residual hills creates a dramatic, pitted surface. The degree of karst development depends on rock purity, jointing, rainfall amount and vegetation cover. When sea level changes interact with karst processes, spectacular coastal features such as the limestone islands of Ha Long Bay or atolls with drowned karst can result.

## Humid tropical and seasonally humid ecosystems: structure and function
Tropical ecosystems range from the tall, multilayered rainforests of the Amazon, Congo and parts of Southeast Asia to the open, grass-dominated savannas of the Serengeti, Cerrado and Australian tropical plains. In rainforests a complex vertical structure exists: emergent trees tower above a continuous canopy with multiple understory layers. Biodiversity is extremely high, and many species have specialised niches. Plant communities progress through successional stages to produce climax communities, but human disturbance and fire can arrest succession at subclimax or plagioclimax stages.

Savanna ecosystems are adapted to pronounced seasonality, with a mixture of grasses and scattered trees or shrubs. Fire regimes and herbivory play central roles in maintaining savanna structure; frequent fires and large grazing herbivores prevent development of closed-canopy forest. Seasonal senescence of grasses and leaf-drop in trees create distinct biomass and litter cycles that drive nutrient flow.

Understanding nutrient cycling in these ecosystems is essential. In humid tropical rainforests most nutrients are held in living biomass and the litter layer; rapid decomposition and uptake by roots means that soils are often surprisingly low in available nutrients despite the lush vegetation. Gersmehl diagrams are useful teaching tools here: they illustrate the relative sizes of nutrient stores (biomass, litter, soil) and the flows between them. Rainforests typically show a large biomass store, moderate litter store and a comparatively small soil store, with rapid fluxes returning nutrients from litter to biomass. Savannas show a larger proportion of nutrients in soil and litter compared with biomass, reflecting the seasonal transfer and storage of organic matter.

## Soils in the tropics: oxisols, laterization and fragility
Soil formation in humid tropical climates is driven by intense chemical weathering and leaching. Laterization concentrates iron and aluminium oxides, producing red and yellow soils that are typically deeply weathered and rich in oxides but poor in readily available plant nutrients. Oxisols (often called latosols in older literature) characterise many tropical rainforest regions: they are physically stable and deeply weathered but have low cation exchange capacity and quick nutrient loss if the protective vegetation is removed. Tropical red and brown earths are commonly found in seasonally humid areas where some leaching occurs but not to the depth of true oxisols.

The fertility of tropical soils is therefore precarious and highly dependent on the presence of vegetation and the rapid cycling of organic matter. When forest is cleared, nutrient-rich litter decomposes and is quickly washed away by heavy rains or lost through erosion, leaving degraded soils that support only low-intensity agriculture unless external inputs or careful management are applied.

## Human impacts and threats to tropical environments
Tropical environments face intense pressure from a range of human activities. Commercial logging, conversion to pasture and cropland, expansion of mechanised agriculture, oil and mineral extraction, road building and urban expansion have fragmented and reduced rainforest cover in many regions. In Southeast Asia the replacement of forest by oil palm plantations and timber extraction has caused loss of biodiversity and soil degradation; in the Amazon, cattle ranching and soy cultivation have driven large-scale deforestation; in central Africa, subsistence farming, commercial logging and mining exert continued pressure on the Congo Basin.

For savannas, overgrazing, inappropriate fire management and agricultural encroachment can alter vegetation composition and accelerate desertification in marginal zones. Infrastructure development increases accessibility and often triggers further land-use change. Climate change compounds these pressures by altering rainfall patterns and increasing the likelihood of extreme droughts or more intense wet seasons, which can change vegetation dynamics and increase susceptibility to fires and erosion.

These impacts have ecological, social and economic consequences. Loss of biodiversity reduces ecosystem resilience and services, carbon release from deforestation contributes to global warming, and local communities can suffer from reduced soil fertility, water pollution and loss of traditional livelihoods. Governance, land tenure and global commodity markets are central to understanding why exploitation continues despite recognized long-term costs.

## Sustainable management: strategies, trade-offs and case studies
Sustaining tropical environments requires integrated approaches that balance conservation with the livelihoods of local people. Protected areas and national parks can conserve core biodiversity, but they are most effective when combined with buffer zones, corridors and community-based management that provide economic incentives for conservation. Payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes, including REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), aim to compensate countries or communities for maintaining forest carbon stocks, but their success depends on clear land tenure, effective monitoring and fair benefit sharing.

Sustainable forestry practices and certification schemes (for example, Forest Stewardship Council standards) can reduce the impacts of logging, while agroforestry and improved fallow systems offer ways for farmers to maintain production without complete forest clearance. Ecotourism has worked in places such as Costa Rica to provide alternative incomes and to fund conservation, although its benefits are uneven and may create new social pressures if not carefully managed.

Case studies are valuable for exam answers. The Amazon demonstrates both the scale of threat and the mixed results of policy: Brazil’s earlier combination of enforcement and incentives achieved notable reductions in deforestation, but recent policy shifts and market demand have reversed some gains. Borneo and Sumatra show how oil palm expansion has driven biodiversity loss and peatland fires, releasing large emissions; attempts at sustainable certification have been partial and contested. The Serengeti illustrates conflicts between conservation and pastoralist livelihoods where fencing, tourism and game management must be balanced with traditional grazing practices. When evaluating solutions, consider ecological effectiveness, economic feasibility, social equity and political practicality; few interventions are without trade-offs.

## Teaching and learning suggestions
When teaching tropical environments, link theory and processes to vivid, recent examples that students can visualise and recall. Use maps to show the global distribution of humid and seasonally humid tropics and diagrams such as cross-sections of forest structure, Gersmehl nutrient cycles and profiles of laterized soils. Fieldwork is often impractical at intercontinental scales, but local analogues—urban parks, planted woodlands, school plots—can be used to explore nutrient cycling, succession and human impacts. Encourage students to compare cases from different continents so they appreciate diversity within the tropics: the Amazon differs from Southeast Asian rainforests in soil type, human pressures and governance. Discussions of management should bring in economic drivers and governance structures; role-plays can help students understand stakeholder conflicts and trade-offs. Finally, practice applying key concepts—space, scale, place, interdependence, diversity and change—to every case study to develop synoptic answers.

## Exam technique
Answering tropical environments questions effectively requires clarity, structure and use of case-specific evidence. For definition and description questions start with a concise definition, then move to characteristic processes or features, illustrating with named examples. For process questions sequence causes and effects logically and use appropriate terminology (for example, solution, laterization, transpiration). When asked to explain landform development, link the rock type, climate and weathering or erosion processes and, if useful, sketch a labelled diagram to support the text. Management and evaluation questions demand balanced argument: state the aims of the intervention, present evidence of success and failure, consider stakeholders and constraints, and finish with a reasoned judgement. Always adapt the depth of your answer to the marks available; allocate about one minute per mark as a planning guide. Use Gersmehl diagrams or soil profiles where they add clarity, but ensure diagrams are labelled and integrated into your explanation. Finally, respond directly to command words: explain requires causes, assess and evaluate require weighing evidence, and suggest asks for reasoned proposals linked to context. Linking processes to specific place-based examples will boost AO2 and AO4 marks and demonstrate the synoptic understanding examiners expect.
