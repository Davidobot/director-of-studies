# Atmosphere and weather (A-level Geography Cambridge International)

## Why atmosphere and weather matter
Atmosphere and weather form a foundation of physical geography because they determine the conditions in which soils, vegetation, rivers and human activities operate. Weather refers to the short-term state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time — sunshine, showers, wind and temperature — while climate describes the long-term patterns of those conditions. For A-level study you must understand the energy flows that drive weather, the large-scale circulation patterns that redistribute heat and moisture around the planet, the processes by which clouds and precipitation form, and how human activity is changing atmospheric behaviour. The topic is highly synoptic: it links to hydrology (through evaporation and precipitation), to ecosystems (through temperature and moisture regimes), and to hazards (through storms, droughts and heatwaves). A clear grasp of energy budgets, circulation cells, and moisture processes will help you explain weather events and to evaluate human interventions such as urban planning or greenhouse gas mitigation.

## Diurnal energy budgets — what happens day and night
The diurnal energy budget describes the daily cycle of energy received and lost at the Earth’s surface. Incoming shortwave solar radiation is the primary input; some of it is reflected back to space by clouds and surface features (this reflection is quantified by albedo), while the rest is absorbed by the land or ocean and the lower atmosphere. During daylight hours sensible heat transfer moves energy from the warmed surface into the air by conduction and convection, and latent heat is lost when water evaporates. After sunset incoming shortwave radiation falls to zero and the surface cools by emitting longwave (infrared) radiation. The balance between incoming and outgoing energy varies with surface type, cloud cover, latitude and season. Urban areas, for instance, have lower albedo and greater heat storage because concrete and tarmac absorb and retain heat, producing warmer night-time temperatures than nearby rural areas. Understanding the diurnal budget helps explain thermal contrasts, land–sea breezes and the timing of convectional showers.

## The global energy budget and atmospheric circulation
At global scales the energy budget is unequal: the tropics receive more incoming solar radiation than they lose, while polar regions lose more than they gain. To restore balance, energy is transported polewards by the atmosphere and oceans. The atmosphere does this through a system of cells and wind belts. The idealised three-cell model — Hadley, Ferrel and Polar cells — explains rising air near the equator (driven by intense heating), subsidence in the subtropics, and the alternating belts of surface easterlies and westerlies. The position and intensity of these cells shift seasonally, particularly where land and sea distribution produces large contrasts; seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) drives monsoon climates. Ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, also move heat and moderate regional climates. On a smaller scale, local temperature contrasts between land and sea or between shaded and sunlit slopes generate pressure gradients that produce sea breezes, valley winds and other mesoscale circulations. To explain climate variations you should be able to link latitude, the distribution of continents and oceans, ocean currents and seasonal insolation to temperature and pressure patterns.

## Atmospheric moisture, cloud formation and types of precipitation
Atmospheric moisture processes control how and when precipitation forms. Evaporation transfers water from liquid to vapour; as moist air rises it cools and condensation occurs when the air reaches saturation. Condensation requires condensation nuclei and produces cloud droplets; further processes yield precipitation. Three principal mechanisms force air to rise: convection (surface heating causing buoyant updraughts), orographic uplift (air rising over topography), and frontal lifting (warmer air rising over cooler air at fronts). Convectional precipitation is typical of equatorial afternoons and summer thunderstorms, frontal precipitation is common in mid-latitudes where contrasting air masses meet, and orographic precipitation dominates windward mountain slopes. The form precipitation takes depends on atmospheric temperature profiles: rain forms when droplets remain liquid to the surface, snow and hail form when freezing occurs aloft, and fog and dew result from cooling to the dew point near the surface. Hail in thunderstorms grows through repeated lifting of ice particles into supercooled regions, producing concentric layers of ice. Being able to describe the sequence from evaporation to condensation to precipitation, and to explain how the lifting mechanism determines precipitation type and distribution, is essential.

## Weather phenomena and extremes
Weather phenomena range from everyday variations to extreme events. Cyclones (tropical systems called hurricanes or typhoons in different oceans) form over warm oceans where low pressure, organised convection and rotation produce intense winds, heavy rain and coastal storm surges. Mid-latitude depressions bring frontal systems and extensive precipitation across temperate zones. Local convective storms can give intense short-duration rainfall and hail, while persistent anticyclones can cause heatwaves or prolonged drought. Atmospheric disturbances also drive hazardous processes such as tornadoes, which result from intense localised rotation within strong thunderstorms. Many weather extremes are linked to larger scale oscillations such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which redistributes heat across the Pacific and alters storm tracks and precipitation patterns globally. In answering exam questions you should be ready to explain the formation, hazards and impacts of these phenomena, and to link them to energy and moisture processes covered earlier.

## The human impact: enhanced greenhouse effect and urban climates
Human activities are altering the atmosphere in two major ways that you must be able to explain and evaluate. First, the enhanced greenhouse effect arises because greenhouse gases — principally carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide produced by fossil fuel combustion, agriculture and land-use change — trap more longwave radiation, producing a net positive radiative forcing. The observable consequences include rising global mean temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, earlier snowmelt and sea-level rise through thermal expansion and ice melt. Second, urbanisation modifies local climates. The urban heat island is a well-documented phenomenon where built surfaces with low albedo and high heat capacity, reduced vegetation and anthropogenic heat emissions cause higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Urban geometry affects wind flow, creating areas of reduced ventilation and channelled winds, while impervious surfaces increase rapid runoff and can alter local humidity and convective responses. Cities can also experience modified precipitation: urban-induced convection and aerosol effects can enhance or redistribute rainfall, often intensifying flood risk. When discussing human impacts you should separate global-scale forcing from local modifications, present evidence for change, and evaluate the success and limitations of mitigation and adaptation strategies such as emissions reductions, urban greening, and heatwave planning.

## Case studies and examples to use in answers
Examiners expect concrete, dated, real-world case studies to support your explanations and evaluations. For the required urban-climate case study consider cities like London or Mexico City to illustrate the urban heat island, or Mumbai to illustrate monsoon interactions and urban flooding. A strong case study describes the physical causes, quantifies impacts where possible, and evaluates responses. For example, a London case study could describe measured night-time temperature differences between urban and rural sites, the role of building materials and transport emissions, impacts on energy demand and public health, and mitigation such as increased urban tree cover and reflective roofing. For global warming, a case study might summarise trends in global mean surface temperature and regional changes in precipitation, describe observed impacts such as increased frequency of heatwaves or changing growing seasons, and evaluate mitigation measures such as international agreements or national policies. Wherever possible choose recent events or studies (post-1980) that your examiner will recognise as real and contemporary. Presenting a range of scales — local (city street), regional (monsoon basin) and global (planetary warming) — will strengthen your answers by showing awareness of interdependence and scale.

## Applying concepts to unfamiliar contexts
A valuable exam skill is applying known processes to new situations. When presented with resource material — a climate graph, an annotated photograph, a satellite image or a short text — begin by identifying the key physical controls visible or implied: latitude, proximity to ocean, prevailing wind direction, topography and land cover. Use your understanding of energy budgets and circulation to infer likely patterns of temperature and pressure, and use moisture-process knowledge to explain the observed precipitation. If asked to predict or evaluate human impacts, consider the typical local responses: urban expansion increases impermeable surfaces and heat storage, while agriculture may increase soil evaporation or dust. Always anchor your inferences to physical principles and be explicit about assumptions when the data are limited.

## Exam technique
When approaching questions in this topic, begin by reading each question carefully and paying attention to command words: define requires a concise definition, describe asks for characteristics and factual detail, explain requires reasons and mechanisms, and assess or evaluate asks you to weigh evidence and form a judgement. For resource-based questions use the resource first: extract the obvious features and then link them to theory. In data-response parts, show calculations clearly and state units. For structured 30-mark questions plan a clear answer: a short introduction that sets out your interpretation, two or three developed paragraphs that each treat a distinct point (process, impact, example), and a concluding judgement that addresses the question directly. Diagrams are high-value: a labelled energy balance sketch, a simplified Hadley cell, a cross-section of orographic precipitation or a temperature profile through a city can save time and add clarity. Make sure diagram labels are precise and integrate the diagram into your written explanation rather than letting it stand alone. Use real case studies to illustrate points and always give dates or ranges where possible; examiners reward specificity. When evaluating management or mitigation, discuss both strengths and limitations, consider differing stakeholder viewpoints and refer to scale — what works at a local level may not be feasible globally. Manage your time so that you can attempt all questions fully, and if you are unsure, write a reasoned explanation and qualify any assumptions. Clear structure, accurate use of terminology and well-chosen examples will consolidate your marks.
