# Hazardous environments (A-level Geography Cambridge International)

## Introduction to hazardous environments
Hazardous environments are places where natural processes pose a significant threat to people, property and infrastructure. At A-level this topic asks you to move beyond simple descriptions of hazards to understand their causes, how they interact with human systems, and the strategies societies use to live with or reduce risk. Hazardous environments include tectonic settings where earthquakes and volcanoes occur, steep or unstable slopes susceptible to mass movement, and atmospheric systems that generate cyclones, tornadoes and intense storms. Throughout your study you should think in terms of processes, primary and secondary impacts, spatial patterns of risk, and the differing capacities of communities and states to prepare for and respond to hazards. Case studies are central: use recent, real-world examples to illustrate causes, consequences and management, and make sure they are placed in context so that you can evaluate the success or failure of responses.

## Tectonic hazards: earthquakes and volcanoes
Tectonic hazards are controlled by the movement of lithospheric plates and the interactions at their boundaries. Earthquakes arise from sudden release of strain accumulated on faults and can produce ground shaking, surface rupture, landslides and, where undersea, tsunamis. Volcanoes produce a range of eruptive behaviours and secondary hazards including pyroclastic flows, lahars, ash fall and lava flows. Understanding the link between plate tectonics, earthquake distribution and volcanic arcs helps explain why certain regions, such as the Pacific ‘Ring of Fire’, are so hazardous. Prediction and monitoring have advanced: seismograph networks reveal foreshock patterns and fault activity, GPS and InSAR detect ground deformation, and gas emissions and thermal anomalies can warn of volcanic unrest. Nevertheless precise prediction of the time and magnitude of earthquakes remains largely probabilistic, so hazard assessment relies on recurrence intervals, historical records and mapping of active faults. Comparative case studies are revealing. The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan illustrated the catastrophic potential of a megathrust event as well as the vulnerability of coastal infrastructure and nuclear installations, while the 2010 earthquake in Haiti demonstrated how poor building standards, high population density and limited emergency services can transform a moderate-sized earthquake into a humanitarian disaster. In contrast, similar magnitude earthquakes in Chile resulted in far fewer fatalities because of stronger enforcement of seismic building codes and effective preparedness.

## Mass movement hazards and slope processes
Mass movements refer to the downslope movement of soil and rock under the influence of gravity and include falls, slides, flows and creep. Weathering, slope steepness, groundwater conditions and vegetation cover determine slope stability, and triggers such as intense rainfall, earthquakes or human activities like excavation and deforestation can rapidly change the balance. The mechanics of movement differ: rotational slides involve a curved slip surface, flows behave like viscous fluids often entraining water and debris, and rockfalls are characterised by freefall and bouncing. The impacts of mass movement vary from local damage to long-distance catastrophic debris flows that destroy settlements and infrastructure. The Oso landslide in Washington State in 2014, which involved rapid downslope movement after prolonged rainfall, showed how even developed countries can suffer major losses when slopes are unstable. In many low-income mountain regions, deforestation and unplanned construction on steep slopes amplify risk, producing recurring disasters such as the Venezuelan Vargas tragedy in 1999 where extreme rainfall triggered widespread debris flows. Mitigation options include engineering measures such as retaining structures and drainage, slope regrading and revegetation to increase cohesion, and, crucially, land-use planning to avoid building in the most hazardous zones.

## Atmospheric hazards: cyclones, tornadoes and storm-related flooding
Atmospheric disturbances range from large-scale tropical cyclones—called hurricanes or typhoons depending on the basin—to smaller but intense tornadoes. Tropical cyclones form over warm ocean waters and produce strong winds, intense rainfall and storm surges that cause coastal flooding. The distribution of risk is determined by ocean temperature patterns, atmospheric circulation and coastal geomorphology. Forecasting for cyclones has improved significantly with satellite monitoring, numerical weather prediction and regional warning centres that provide track and intensity forecasts, but rapid intensification and exact surge heights remain hard to predict. Long-term trends associated with climate change, such as rising sea surface temperatures and sea-level rise, can increase cyclone intensity and exacerbate impacts. The devastation of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013, particularly from its storm surge, illustrates how physical exposure combined with social vulnerability leads to high loss of life and livelihoods, while the repeated improvement in Bangladesh’s cyclone early warning systems and shelter programmes shows how preparedness can sharply reduce mortality even as hazards persist. Tornadoes, though smaller in scale, can cause concentrated destruction as in Joplin, Missouri in 2011, where a single intense tornado led to enormous casualties and urban damage. For all atmospheric hazards, the interaction of meteorological processes with human settlement patterns, coastal defences and ecosystem buffers such as mangroves is key to understanding outcomes.

## Impacts, vulnerability and risk perception
The effects of hazards are best understood through the concepts of primary and secondary impacts, vulnerability and resilience. Primary impacts are the immediate physical consequences: collapsed buildings in an earthquake, ash deposition from a volcanic eruption, or inundation from a storm surge. Secondary impacts arise later and may be more widespread, such as disease outbreaks following flood-induced contamination of water supplies, economic disruption from closed ports and airports after an ash cloud, or cascading failures such as power loss that hamper rescue and recovery. Vulnerability depends on exposure, socioeconomic status, governance, infrastructure quality and access to resources. High-income countries can suffer large economic losses but often have lower mortality rates because of better preparedness, building standards and emergency response. Conversely, less developed countries may have lower absolute economic losses but much higher proportional impacts on livelihoods and life, as seen in Haiti and informal settlements affected by landslides and floods. Risk perception shapes individual and collective behaviour; people may underestimate risks if hazards are infrequent or if economic pressures push them to live in dangerous locations. Understanding stakeholders’ perspectives—residents, authorities, NGOs and insurers—helps explain the choices made before and after an event.

## Prediction, preparedness and sustainable management
Managing hazardous environments combines scientific prediction, structural and non-structural mitigation, land-use planning and community-level preparedness. Prediction ranges from short-term volcano monitoring and cyclone tracking to probabilistic seismic hazard assessments that inform building codes. Structural mitigation includes earthquake-resistant design such as base isolation, reinforcement of masonry and controlled land reclamation, while flood management may use both hard engineering like levees and soft, ecosystem-based approaches such as restoring floodplains and mangroves which attenuate storm surges. Evacuation planning, early warning systems and education campaigns build social resilience and can markedly reduce casualties, as shown by improved cyclone outcomes in Bangladesh. Insurance and financial instruments transfer risk but can also complicate long-term sustainability if they encourage rebuilding in hazardous areas. The notion of retreat—relocating communities away from recurring hazard zones—is contentious but occasionally necessary; managed retreat requires political will, fair compensation and long-term planning. Case studies that evaluate management strategies should weigh short-term effectiveness, costs, equity and environmental consequences. For example, hard coastal defences may protect urban zones but disrupt sediment flows and harm habitats, whereas integrated coastal zone management seeks a balance between protection and ecological function.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on hazardous environments aim to demonstrate clear knowledge, applied understanding and evaluative judgement. Begin extended answers with a concise definition of the hazard or concept and a sentence outlining your approach, then develop paragraphs that move logically from processes and causes to impacts and management, using named case studies to support each point. For a 30-mark essay, allocate time to plan, write and review: outline your case study briefly—where it is, the hazard processes involved, the main impacts and the management measures—and use this to illustrate general points about vulnerability and response. Diagrams and labelled sketches are valuable: a simple cross-section showing a volcanic cone and lahar pathways, a hazard map with zones of risk, or a timeline of an event can earn marks for clarity and analysis when integrated into the text. When a question asks you to assess or evaluate, present balanced evidence and conclude with a reasoned judgement that compares alternatives or weighs costs and benefits; avoid unsupported assertions. Where command words require explanation or description, focus on clear mechanisms and avoid drifting into unrelated material. For questions that present unfamiliar resource material, practise extracting key trends and linking them to theory—explain what the data imply about causes, impacts or effectiveness of responses. Finally, always relate your arguments back to the question, using comparative language where appropriate, and ensure your conclusion directly answers the question with an informed, evidence-based judgement.
