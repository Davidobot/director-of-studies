# Population (A-level Geography Cambridge International)

## Overview and key concepts
Population geography examines how and why the numbers, composition and distribution of people change over time and space, and what those changes mean for places and environments. At A‑level you should be comfortable with core terms such as birth rate, death rate, natural increase, fertility rate, infant mortality rate, dependency ratio and carrying capacity. These concepts sit within the key geographical ideas of space, scale, place, interdependence and change: population processes operate at household, local, national and global scales, they shape places and are shaped by environmental, economic and political systems, and they change through time in ways that have profound consequences for development, infrastructure and the environment.

## Measures of population change and how to use them
Population change is the result of two main components: natural increase (births minus deaths) and net migration (inflows minus outflows). Familiarity with the measures used to describe these components is essential. The crude birth rate and crude death rate are expressed per 1,000 people per year; fertility rate (usually the total fertility rate) estimates the average number of children a woman would have in her lifetime; infant mortality rate counts deaths under one year per 1,000 live births. The dependency ratio expresses the proportion of the population thought to be economically dependent (commonly ages 0–14 and 65+) relative to the working-age population (typically 15–64). In examinations you will be expected to define these measures, extract values from tables and graphs, and use them to explain patterns and trends. When working from age/sex pyramids, interpret the shape: a broad base signals high fertility and youthfulness, a columnar shape indicates low fertility and relatively stable growth, and a top-heavy profile demonstrates population ageing.

## The Demographic Transition Model and population structure
The Demographic Transition Model (DTM) is a central tool for organising how birth and death rates change over time as societies develop. In Stage 1 both birth and death rates are high and population growth is slow. Stage 2 sees falling death rates while birth rates remain high, producing rapid natural increase; this pattern was typical of many countries during early industrialisation and of some modern LICs experiencing improvements in health without large changes in fertility. In Stage 3 birth rates fall, slowing growth, as changes in status, urbanisation and access to contraception reduce family size. Stage 4 shows low birth and death rates and stable population, while Stage 5, included in many modern versions of the model, describes very low birth rates producing ageing and eventual decline in population. The DTM is a useful heuristic for exam answers, but you must be ready to criticise it: it is Eurocentric, does not always match the experience of countries affected by migration, conflict or rapid policy change, and cannot predict the timing of transitions.

## Causes of fertility and mortality variation
Fertility and mortality vary for social, economic, environmental and political reasons. Social factors include cultural norms about family size, the role of women and access to education. Economic influences range from the cost of childrearing and female participation in the labour market to the security offered by pensions and the need for labour in agricultural systems. Environmental conditions and public health shape mortality through the prevalence of infectious disease, nutrition and sanitation. Political decisions—healthcare provision, family planning programmes and laws—can sharply alter rates, as can sudden shocks such as epidemics, wars or natural disasters. Use country examples to illustrate these causes: the rapid decline in fertility in Bangladesh and Iran in the late twentieth century is commonly linked to strong family planning and female education policies; the high infant mortality in parts of sub‑Saharan Africa reflects limited access to healthcare and sanitation; the very low fertility in Japan is connected to economic pressures, long working hours and the high cost of childcare.

## Population, resources and carrying capacity
Population cannot be considered independently of resources. Food security is the ability of a population to obtain sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet dietary needs; it is influenced by production, distribution, access and stability. Carrying capacity is a contested concept that considers how many people an environment can support given current technology and consumption patterns. Debate over optimum population pits arguments that more people can drive innovation and efficient use of resources against warnings from Malthusian perspectives that population growth will outstrip food supply and environmental limits. In practice, problems of food shortages often arise from a mix of physical constraints (climate, soil fertility), socio‑economic factors (poverty, distributional inequalities), political instability and technological limitations. The Green Revolution illustrates how technological change can raise carrying capacity in many places, yet it also highlights environmental trade‑offs such as soil degradation and water overuse. In answers, evaluate both biophysical limits and human responses—technology, trade, and policy—to explain outcomes.

## Managing natural increase: policies and approaches
Countries have used a variety of policies to influence natural increase. Anti‑natalist programmes aim to reduce fertility through family planning, contraception access, education for women and sometimes incentives or penalties. Pro‑natalist policies encourage higher birth rates by offering financial incentives, generous parental leave, subsidised childcare and housing support. Policies to manage the consequences of natural increase include investing in education, healthcare and housing when populations are young, or adjusting pensions, healthcare systems and labour markets when populations age. When assessing policies, consider intended goals, practical delivery, equity and unintended outcomes. Policy success depends not only on design but on cultural acceptability, administrative capacity and broader economic conditions. Short-term successes may bring long-term challenges: rapid fertility decline can create a demographic dividend if accompanied by job creation, but it can also lead to labour shortages and ageing if not managed.

## Case study: China’s population policy and its consequences
China provides a clear illustration of deliberate population control and its complex outcomes. From the late 1970s China implemented a strict one‑child policy in most of the country to reduce rapid population growth that policymakers feared would impede development. The policy combined incentives for compliance with penalties for violations and relied on a strong state apparatus to enforce limits, alongside widespread family planning education. Fertility plunged and population growth slowed, contributing to economic gains and improving living standards for many. However, the policy produced unintended consequences: a rapidly ageing population, a declining working‑age cohort that risks slowing economic growth, and a distorted sex ratio skewed by a cultural preference for sons in some areas. Responding to these problems, China relaxed the policy in 2015 to allow two children and later introduced further measures to encourage larger families, but uptake has been limited because of the high cost of housing, education and childrearing, and because social attitudes had already shifted toward smaller families. This case demonstrates the need to evaluate both short‑term effectiveness and long‑term social, economic and ethical consequences when judging population policies.

## Implications for development, planning and environment
Population trends shape and are shaped by development. Youthful populations pose demands for schools, jobs and housing but can generate rapid economic growth if a productive labour force is employed. Ageing populations pressure pensions, healthcare and may require higher taxation or increased immigration to sustain workforces. Urbanisation driven by natural increase and rural–urban migration changes land use, creates agglomerations of demand for services and infrastructure and can exacerbate environmental pressures such as air pollution and waste management. Planners and policymakers must consider spatial patterns of population change: where growth concentrates, which areas are losing people and how migration streams alter regional balances. Sustainable outcomes usually hinge on integrated policies that combine education, healthcare, infrastructure investment and environmental management rather than single‑issue approaches.

## Exam technique
When tackling population questions in Paper 2, start by carefully reading the question and underlining command words and required scales (local, national, global). For short data‑response parts, quote figures accurately, show any simple calculations and use them to support concise interpretations. For questions involving age/sex pyramids, describe the shape, identify key features such as youth bulges or ageing, and link these features to causes and likely socio‑economic consequences. In longer structured essays, begin with a brief definition of key terms to secure AO1 marks, then organise your answer into clear paragraphs that each make a distinct point supported by evidence or an example; integrate your chosen case study early and refer to specific named data or outcomes to demonstrate depth. Balance description with explanation and remember to evaluate: weigh the strengths and limitations of theories (for example the DTM), discuss alternative explanations, and consider the role of scale and place in producing different outcomes. For evaluation and judgement questions, reach a clear, supported conclusion that addresses the question directly. Time management is crucial: allocate time proportionally to the marks available, spend a few minutes planning longer answers, and leave a short period to check factual accuracy and spelling of key terms. Above all, use precise geographical vocabulary, link human and physical factors where relevant, and ensure every paragraph adds to an argument rather than repeating points.
