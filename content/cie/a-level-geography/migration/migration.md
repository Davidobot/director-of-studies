# Migration (A-level Geography Cambridge International)

## Introduction and definition
Migration is the movement of people from one place to another with the intention of staying for at least one year. It is a key component of population change and must be understood alongside natural increase to explain how populations grow, shrink and change in structure. Migration operates at many scales: short-distance rural–urban moves within a country, long-distance international flows between continents, and everything in between. For the purposes of Cambridge International AS & A Level Geography, it is important to treat migration as both a demographic process and a socioeconomic phenomenon: it reshapes labour markets, alters age and sex structures, redistributes skills and resources, and creates cultural, political and environmental consequences in both source and destination areas. Always date and name case studies where required; contemporary examples post-1980 will be most relevant and compelling.

## Theories and models that explain migration
Several simple models help organise thinking about why people move and where they go. Lee’s push–pull framework is central: people are pushed from origin areas by unfavourable conditions such as unemployment, conflict or environmental degradation, and pulled to destination areas by perceived advantages like higher wages, safety or better services. Lee’s model also emphasises intervening obstacles and personal factors that modify decisions. Ravenstein’s ‘laws’ of migration and the gravity model remain useful: shorter distances and nearer opportunities usually attract more migrants, and larger population centres exert a stronger ‘pull’. Zelinsky’s mobility transition links migration patterns to stages of the demographic transition, predicting high rural–urban migration during industrialisation and more complex circulatory movements in post-industrial societies. These models are heuristic: they simplify reality and should be applied critically, showing their strengths and limitations in exam answers.

## Types and patterns of migration
Migration can be internal or international, voluntary or forced, short-term or permanent. Internal migration includes rural–urban flows that drive urbanisation in many low- and middle-income countries, counter-urbanisation in some high-income contexts, and intra-urban movements such as suburbanisation, gentrification and urban renewal. Stepped migration describes the gradual movement through a settlement hierarchy—for example from village to small town, to regional city, and then to a global city. International migration includes labour migration, family reunification, student flows and refugee movements. Patterns vary by distance and age: most migration is short distance and internal, and migrants are commonly younger adults, producing selective changes in population structure at origin and destination. Gender patterns vary by context; in some regions large numbers of male labour migrants dominate flows, whereas in others female migration, often for domestic or care work, is substantial.

## Causes and constraints
Causes of migration are multi-causal and operate at different scales. Economic differentials are powerful drivers: wage gaps, employment opportunity and demand for particular skills pull migrants to cities and across borders. Social factors include family reunification and educational opportunities; political causes include conflict, persecution and human rights abuses that force people to flee. Environmental drivers now include sudden-onset disasters and slower processes such as desertification and sea-level rise that undermine livelihoods. Chain migration and migrant networks reduce costs and risks over time, reinforcing flows between specific origins and destinations. Constraints include distance, the financial cost of moving, lack of information, legal barriers such as visas and quotas, language and cultural differences, and physical obstacles like borders and seas. Policy choices and global events—economic crises, conflict, pandemics—can rapidly alter push and pull forces, so case studies should show temporal change in causes.

## Impacts on source and destination areas
Migration produces complex and often mixed outcomes. Source areas may benefit economically through remittances that support households, stimulate investment and reduce poverty; remittances can also increase inequality if only certain households send migrants. Emigration can cause ‘brain drain’ when skilled workers leave, reducing human capital and constraining development, though long-term benefits sometimes accrue through diaspora networks and returning migrants. Demographically, out-migration often leaves a skewed age structure with high dependency ratios if working-age adults depart. Destination areas receive labour that can fill gaps, contribute to economic growth and enrich cultural life, but they may also face pressures on housing, services and social cohesion. Integration challenges, discrimination and political backlash are common, as are benefits such as entrepreneurial activity by migrants. Refugee inflows pose humanitarian challenges and require international coordination; their impacts are shaped by the scale of arrival and the capacity and policies of host states. Sound answers will evaluate both positive and negative impacts and consider temporal and spatial variation.

## Internal migration and urban change
Internal migration is central to understanding settlement dynamics. Rural–urban migration feeds urban growth, transforms labour markets and fosters the expansion of informal sectors in many LICs and MICs. Stepped migration and urban–urban moves build up city hierarchies and can concentrate skills in megacities. In HICs, counter-urbanisation and re-urbanisation show that migration is not unidirectional; lifestyle choices, transport improvements and teleworking have altered patterns. Within urban areas, migration drives processes such as suburbanisation, gentrification and residential segregation. The bid-rent model helps explain why different activities cluster in central or peripheral zones based on land values, while social segregation often results from income differences, ethnic clustering and planning policies. Specific national examples are instructive: China’s rural–urban migration has been shaped by industrialisation and the hukou household registration system, which constrains migrants’ access to urban services and produces distinctive spatial inequalities. Use local and international examples to show how internal migration reshapes places.

## Managing international migration: policies and case studies
States manage migration through a mix of policies that aim to control borders, select desirable migrants, protect refugees, and harness the benefits of migration. Options include visa regimes, points-based systems for skilled migration, temporary worker programmes, restrictions or facilitation of family reunification, and asylum procedures regulated by international law and agencies such as the UN refugee system. Policy outcomes vary: the European Union’s freedom of movement created intra-regional labour flows, while countries such as Australia and Canada use points systems to target specific skills. The management of forced migration relies on humanitarian protection and often places pressure on neighbouring states; Turkey and Lebanon have hosted large numbers of Syrian refugees, illustrating both generosity and strain on infrastructure.

A classic case study for examination is the Mexico–United States migration stream. Driven historically by wage differentials, labour demand in agriculture and construction, family networks, and episodic political and security issues, this stream has been characterised by circular migration, strong family and community networks, and significant remittance flows back to Mexico. Impacts on Mexico include remittance-fuelled household incomes and investment, demographic changes in sending communities, and concerns about brain drain in some sectors. For the United States, Mexican migrants have supplied low- and medium-skilled labour, contributed to cultural diversity and entrepreneurship, but also sparked political debate about border control and service provision. Policy responses—ranging from guest worker programmes to border enforcement and deportations—have had mixed success in balancing labour market needs with security and political considerations. Use such a case study to show causes, character, scale, impacts and the strengths and weaknesses of management strategies.

## Conceptual links and synoptic thinking
Migration must be understood in relation to the key geographic concepts of space, scale, place, environment, interdependence, diversity and change. Spatially, migration redistributes population and resources; scale matters because local impacts differ from national and global effects. Places are socially produced through migrant settlement, cultural exchange and economic linkages. Environmental change, from climate stress to urban sprawl, both drives and receives migrants. Interdependence between sending and receiving areas is evident in trade-offs: remittances sustain origin communities while destination economies may depend on migrant labour. Diversity arises from different migrant experiences—by gender, age, skill level and legal status—and change is constant as flows respond to economic cycles, policy shifts and crises. In answers, explicitly draw these connections to demonstrate deeper understanding and to meet assessment objectives that reward application and evaluation.

## Exam technique
In examination answers, begin by defining migration precisely and setting the scale and timeframe you are discussing. Use named, dated case studies to support assertions—examiners expect real examples, preferably post-1980, and clear reference to whether a case is local, national or international. When applying theory, briefly explain the model (for example, Lee’s push–pull factors or Zelinsky’s mobility transition) and then test it against evidence from your case study, noting exceptions and limitations. For data response questions, extract key trends succinctly and relate numbers to causes and impacts; show any simple calculations clearly and interpret their meaning rather than just presenting figures.

Structure longer answers with a short introduction, a developed body where you apply theory and evidence, and a reasoned conclusion that evaluates the extent to which your evidence supports the argument. For evaluation, weigh different viewpoints, consider short- and long-term effects, and address the roles of policy and context. Where a question asks about management, assess the effectiveness of policies by considering objectives, implementation challenges, costs and unintended consequences. Always integrate geographical skills: refer to spatial patterns, scale, and the limitations of sources or data provided.

Time management is crucial. For papers with Section A resource questions, spend the first few minutes annotating resources and planning concise points tied to the command words. For Section B essays, allocate time for planning, writing and a short review. Use key vocabulary—migration stream, remittances, brain drain/gain, chain migration, stepped migration, immigrant selectivity—and make sure any diagrams or sketch maps add clarity and are labelled. Finally, practice past papers, include a range of case studies from LICs, MICs and HICs, and rehearse linking theory with up-to-date examples so that your responses are analytical, grounded in evidence and clearly evaluated.
