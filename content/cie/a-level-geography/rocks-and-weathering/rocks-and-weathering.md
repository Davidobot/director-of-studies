# Rocks and weathering (A-level Geography Cambridge International)

## Introduction: why rocks and weathering matter
Rocks and weathering form the foundation of much of physical geography because they control the shape of the landscape and determine how quickly landforms change. Understanding plate tectonics explains where different rock types and major landforms originate, while weathering and slope processes explain the breakdown and movement of rock at the surface. For A‑level study you need to know the processes, the factors that control their operation, the landforms that result, and how people influence slope stability and landscape change. Throughout, you will be expected to use real examples and at least one clear case study of human impacts on slopes and attempts to reduce mass movements.

## Plate tectonics and the large‑scale origin of rocks and landforms
Plate tectonics provides the global framework for many landforms and controls where different rock types are exposed at the surface. The Earth’s lithosphere is divided into rigid plates that move relative to each other. At divergent or constructive boundaries plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and build mid‑ocean ridges and new oceanic crust through sea‑floor spreading. At conservative boundaries plates slide past each other; the relative motion generates strike‑slip faults and earthquake belts such as the San Andreas. At convergent or destructive boundaries plates collide or one plate is forced beneath another in subduction zones, producing deep ocean trenches, volcanic arcs and fold mountain belts. Continental collision (two continental plates converging) builds large fold mountain ranges such as the Himalayas, while subduction of oceanic beneath continental lithosphere produces volcanic mountain chains and island arcs as in Japan and the Philippines. Recognising these plate margin types and the landforms and hazards associated with them helps explain the distribution of rock types, seismicity and volcanic activity.

## Physical weathering: processes that break rock without chemical change
Physical weathering, also called mechanical weathering, breaks rock into smaller fragments through physical forces. Freeze–thaw action occurs where water enters joints or cracks, freezes, expands and pries the rock apart; it is particularly effective in upland temperate zones with daily or seasonal freeze–thaw cycles. Heating and cooling cause expansion and contraction; repeated cycles lead to thermal fracture, important in deserts and areas with large diurnal temperature ranges. Salt crystal growth affects porous rocks in coastal or arid environments: saline water evaporates and salt crystals form in pores, their growth exerting pressure that breaks rock apart. Pressure release or dilatation happens when deeply buried igneous rocks (plutons) are exhumed; the reduction in confining pressure allows the rock to expand and exfoliate in sheets. Vegetation root action causes mechanical wedging when roots grow into cracks and force them wider. It is useful to picture these processes operating together: for example, a granite outcrop in a temperate upland may suffer freeze–thaw in winter and root wedging in summer, producing scree at the base of slopes.

## Chemical weathering: breakdown by chemical reactions
Chemical weathering transforms minerals and dissolves rock through reactions involving water and atmospheric gases. Hydrolysis is the chemical breakdown of silicate minerals (for example, feldspar altering to clay minerals such as kaolinite) and is most active where warm and wet conditions promote rapid chemical reactions. Hydration involves the absorption of water into mineral structures, causing expansion and weakening. Carbonation is the reaction of carbon dioxide dissolved in rainwater to form weak carbonic acid that dissolves calcium carbonate in limestone, producing karst features such as caves, sinkholes and solutional valleys. Oxidation, though not listed specifically in the core list, also plays a role where iron minerals weather and produce characteristic reddish soils. The rate and dominance of chemical weathering are strongly controlled by temperature and moisture: warm, wet tropical climates favour intense chemical weathering and deep weathering profiles, whereas cold or dry climates limit chemical breakdown.

## Factors controlling the type and rate of weathering
Weathering is not uniform; its type and pace are controlled by a combination of climatic, lithological, structural, biological and topographic factors. Climate governs the energy available for reactions (temperature) and the supply of water, so the Peltier‑style relationship between mean annual temperature and precipitation helps predict dominant weathering processes: low temperature and low rainfall favour physical weathering, high temperature and high rainfall favour chemical weathering, and hot dry conditions favour salt weathering. Rock type matters because mineral composition and hardness determine susceptibility: limestone dissolves readily by carbonation, feldspar‑rich igneous rocks are vulnerable to hydrolysis, and well‑cemented sandstones resist both mechanical and chemical attack. Rock structure—jointing, bedding planes and faulting—provides routes for water and roots; more joints mean more surface area for weathering. Vegetation both protects and enhances weathering: plant cover can reduce surface temperature extremes and intercept rainfall (reducing rainsplash), while roots and organic acids can open cracks and encourage chemical alteration. Relief affects drainage and runoff; steep slopes tend to shed water rapidly but may be more prone to mass wasting, while gentle slopes allow deeper soil and weathering profiles to develop.

## Slope processes and mass movement
Slopes are dynamic because gravity constantly acts on weathered material. Slope processes range from the small‑scale movement of weathered grains to large mass movements. Rainsplash dislodges individual particles, and surface runoff in the form of sheetwash and rills transports them downslope. Mass movements include slow soil heave (creep), more fluid flows such as mudflows and earthflows that occur when water saturates material and reduces internal strength, slides where a cohesive block moves along a discrete plane, and falls where rock detaches and free‑falls, creating talus or scree. Conditions that trigger mass movement include increased pore water pressure from heavy rain, undercutting of slopes by rivers or coastal erosion, seismic shaking, and human activity that changes loading or drainage. Recognising the differences between types is important: flows are water‑rich and travel rapidly, slides move on defined slip surfaces, and creep is slow but widespread and detectable through tilting trees and fences.

## Human impacts on slopes and techniques to modify stability
Human actions can both increase and decrease slope stability. Activities such as deforestation, intensive agriculture, excavation, mining, construction on slopes, and poor drainage can remove stabilising vegetation, increase surface runoff, overload slopes and create perched water tables, all of which increase the likelihood of mass movement. Urbanisation often seals surfaces, increasing rapid runoff that erodes and undercuts slopes downstream. Conversely, humans can also stabilise slopes through engineering and biological methods. Structural measures such as rock‑bolting or pinning and the application of protective netting prevent rockfalls and hold unstable rock in place. Grading or benching reduces slope angle and removes oversteepened sections, decreasing the driving forces for movement. Drainage systems, including sub‑surface drains and diversion channels, lower pore water pressures and reduce saturation. Afforestation and soil bioengineering use roots to bind soils and extract water, improving long‑term stability while offering ecological benefits. Each technique has limitations: hard engineering can be expensive, visually intrusive and may transfer problems further downslope; vegetation takes time to establish and may be inadequate alone on very steep or heavily loaded slopes. Effective slope management therefore usually combines approaches tailored to the site and scale of the problem.

## Examples and a model case study approach
Good revision requires linking processes to places. For plate tectonics, contrasting the Mid‑Atlantic Ridge (sea‑floor spreading) with the Himalayan collision zone (continental collision and fold mountain building) illustrates global process–landform links. For weathering, a classic temperate example is the freeze–thaw breakdown of rock on the Cairngorms or the Scottish Highlands producing blockfields and scree, whereas tropical deep weathering profiles and lateritic soils are well illustrated in parts of Brazil or Madagascar. Salt weathering and wind‑scaled thermal fracture are typical of desert environments such as parts of the Sahara or central Australia. For slope processes and human impacts, a suitable case study might be a recent landslide in a populated hillside region where deforestation, heavy rainfall and road cutting contributed to failure. When preparing a case study, describe the physical setting, human activities that altered slope conditions, the sequence of events leading to movement, the impacts on people and infrastructure, and the management responses. Evaluate efforts to reduce mass movement by examining effectiveness, cost, environmental consequences and sustainability, and conclude with a balanced judgement about what worked and what did not.

## Exam technique
In exams, approach rocks and weathering questions by first making sure you understand the command word and identify the assessment focus—knowledge, application, skills or evaluation. Begin extended answers with a clear definition where required, then structure your response logically: set out the process (how it works), explain the controls (why it varies), give a relevant place‑based example to demonstrate application, and, for higher‑mark or evaluative questions, weigh advantages and disadvantages before concluding. Use labelled diagrams and simple sketch maps where appropriate; a well‑labelled diagram of a freeze–thaw cycle, a slope profile showing mass‑movement types, or a cross‑section of a subduction zone can add clarity and secure marks. When using case studies, be concise but specific: name the location, give dates if possible, describe causes and impacts, and evaluate management by considering success, limitations and longer‑term sustainability. Time your answers to allow planning and a short conclusion that synthesises the evidence. For evaluation questions, set out clear criteria for judgement (for example cost, environmental impact, durability) and apply them to reach a balanced verdict. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions, include diagrams in your planning, and ensure each paragraph links cause with effect so your answers demonstrate both knowledge and geographical thinking.
