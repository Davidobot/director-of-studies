# Environmental management (A-level Geography Cambridge International)

## Overview of the topic and why it matters
Environmental management sits at the heart of human geography because it brings together physical processes, human needs and political choices. At A‑level you are expected to understand the full sweep of issues: how societies secure energy and other resources, how human activity degrades environments at local and regional scales, and how planners, communities and governments attempt to manage or reverse that degradation. The topic requires you to think across scales from the household to the global, to combine factual knowledge of resources and technologies with an appreciation of social, economic and political constraints, and to judge the relative success of different approaches using evidence. You will be assessed on your knowledge, your ability to apply that knowledge to unfamiliar situations, your use and interpretation of data and sources, and your capacity to weigh up different viewpoints and outcomes.

## Sustainable energy supplies: types, trends and impacts
A central strand of environmental management is the shifting balance between renewable and non‑renewable energy sources. Renewables include hydroelectric power, wind, solar and biofuels; non‑renewables are fossil fuels and nuclear. At national scale the mix of energy is shaped by a country’s resource endowment, its level of development, technological capacity, climate and energy policy. Over recent decades many countries have reduced the share of coal and increased that of natural gas and renewables, driven by concerns about air pollution, energy security and the enhanced greenhouse effect. However, transitions are uneven. High income countries have more capacity to invest in large‑scale renewables and grid upgrades, while some middle and low income countries still depend heavily on biomass, oil or coal.

Environmental impacts vary with fuel type and with supply chain. Fossil fuel extraction and combustion produce air pollution, greenhouse gases and local landscape damage from mining and drilling. Large hydropower schemes can generate vast amounts of electricity but also cause ecological change, displace communities and alter sediment regimes downstream. Wind and solar have low emissions in operation but require land, materials and transmission infrastructure; biofuels raise debates about land use and food security. Thinking critically about sustainable energy therefore involves weighing immediate benefits against long‑term environmental and social costs, recognising trade‑offs and analysing the context that makes particular options feasible or not.

## Managing energy supply: strategies and case study approaches
The management of energy supply involves national strategy, siting decisions for power stations, and the practicalities of integrating generation with distribution and demand management. National energy strategies may aim to diversify sources, improve security of supply, reduce emissions or promote domestic industry. Successful strategies typically combine policy instruments such as subsidies, taxes, regulation and research support with infrastructure investment and international agreements. At the project scale, assessing a named electricity scheme requires consideration of the technical capacity, environmental impacts, displacement or resettlement, costs and benefits to local and national stakeholders, and alternative options that were considered.

When studying a case you should describe the scheme’s purpose and technical features, explain the reasons for its location, identify environmental impacts at local and wider scales, and evaluate outcomes using evidence. Useful comparative examples to consider in essays include large hydro schemes that provide bulk power but cause social and ecological disruption, and smaller renewable projects or decentralised systems that offer lower environmental costs but may deliver less capacity. In evaluating success, consider factors such as longevity, local livelihoods, biodiversity impacts, greenhouse gas emissions over the project life cycle, and the extent to which the scheme met stated policy goals.

## Environmental degradation: pollution, water and land problems
Environmental degradation is a multi‑faceted topic that includes pollution of air, water and soil along with the deterioration of rural and urban environments. Pollution sources can be point sources such as an industrial outfall or power plant, or diffuse sources such as agricultural runoff and vehicle emissions. Water quality problems arise from untreated sewage, industrial effluents, agricultural chemicals and poor waste disposal, creating health risks and reducing ecosystem services. In rural areas degradation often manifests as soil erosion, salinisation and deforestation, driven by overgrazing, unsustainable agricultural practices or population pressure. In urban areas degradation appears as air pollution, congested transport networks, inadequate waste management and the growth of informal settlements with limited services.

Understanding these processes demands attention to cause and effect across social and physical dimensions. For example, intensification of agriculture may increase short‑term yields while accelerating soil nutrient depletion and erosion; rapid urbanisation may stimulate economic growth but create hotspots of pollution and strains on water supply. When you explain degradation, always link human activities and policy choices to the physical responses they provoke, and consider both immediate local impacts and secondary effects that can extend downstream, both literally and figuratively.

## Managing degraded environments: approaches and challenges
The management of degraded environments requires a toolkit that spans remediation, prevention and long‑term stewardship. Solutions can be technical, regulatory, economic or community‑based. Technical interventions include pollution control technology, wastewater treatment, reforestation and soil conservation measures. Regulatory measures include environmental standards, enforcement mechanisms and land‑use planning. Economic instruments such as taxes, subsidies, payment for ecosystem services and marketable permits seek to change behaviour. Community and participatory approaches aim to embed local knowledge and secure buy‑in, which can be critical for the sustainability of interventions.

However, constraints are significant. Financial resources, weak governance, conflicting stakeholder interests and the legacy of past damage all limit what can be achieved. Trade‑offs are common: protecting an ecosystem may limit short‑term economic opportunities; cleaning up a contaminated river may be costly and require long maintenance times. Effective management therefore often combines several strategies and is underpinned by environmental impact assessment, baseline monitoring and adaptive management so that policies can be adjusted as new evidence emerges. When evaluating attempts to improve a degraded environment you should judge effectiveness against agreed objectives, consider equity and distributional impacts, and review the durability of solutions.

## Evaluation frameworks: judging success and failure
To evaluate initiatives you need to apply clear frameworks. The three pillars of sustainability—environmental, economic and social—provide a starting point, but assessments also need to address scale, timescale and distributional outcomes. A successful initiative at one scale may generate problems at another: a national hydropower project that reduces fossil fuel imports may displace tens of thousands of people locally. Cost–benefit analysis can be useful but must include non‑market values such as ecosystem services and cultural losses. Indicators such as changes in pollutant concentrations, biodiversity measures, employment figures, and access to services provide empirical evidence, but you should always interrogate data quality, baselines and attribution. Qualitative evidence from affected communities, stakeholder analysis and governance capacity often explains why technical solutions succeed or fail.

Critical evaluation in essays therefore requires balanced discussion: state the aims of an initiative, summarise evidence of outcomes, analyse the contributing causes of success or failure, and conclude with a reasoned judgement that acknowledges uncertainties. Where relevant, compare alternative strategies and explore how different stakeholders experience the outcomes.

## Examples and case study selection for revision
Choosing case studies is an important strategic decision. Good case studies are recent, real, and well documented at different scales. They should allow you to discuss causes, impacts and management and to evaluate outcomes. For energy policy you might compare a country‑level strategy that prioritised renewables with a large infrastructural project that relied on conventional energy. For degraded environments consider contrasting an urban river cleanup with a rural reforestation programme. When revising, ensure that your case studies include the problem, the response, measurable outcomes and clear critical points. Know the timeline, the main actors involved, the technologies or policies used, and one or two quantitative indicators that demonstrate impact. Being able to place a case study in a wider context—regional economic aims, international agreements or national development plans—strengthens your evaluation and shows synoptic understanding.

## Teaching and learning focus: skills to develop
Environmental management requires both factual knowledge and practical geographical skills. You should be able to interpret graphs and tables showing energy trends, pollution levels or population affected; to draw and annotate simple diagrams that explain processes; and to synthesise information from different sources to reach conclusions. Fieldwork and practical investigation are valuable where possible: measuring water quality parameters, observing land‑use changes, or interviewing local stakeholders builds understanding and provides authentic evidence for analysis. In classrooms without fieldwork, use contemporary news reports, environmental assessments and technical summaries as resources and practise critiquing their quality and bias. Always link physical processes to human decisions and policy frameworks, and practise structuring responses that move from description through explanation to evaluation.

## Exam technique
In exams aim to answer the question precisely, using the command word as your guide. For a 20‑mark essay allocate time to introduce the issue, outline relevant theory or concepts, present at least one well‑developed case study and critically evaluate outcomes before reaching a balanced conclusion. Use clear paragraphing that links evidence to argument and integrates physical and human factors. For shorter structured questions be concise: define key terms, explain processes with one or two linked examples, and include brief evaluation where asked. Always consider scale and timescale, and where possible quantify outcomes or give specific indicators to show depth of knowledge. When asked to evaluate, weigh social, economic and environmental dimensions and discuss trade‑offs and uncertainties rather than asserting absolute success or failure. Finally, use simple diagrams or labelled sketches where they clarify your explanation, and reference your case studies by name and date to show precise knowledge.
