# Medicine Through Time (GCSE History AQA)

## Medieval medicine
Medieval medicine in England was shaped by religion, tradition, and classical ideas. Many people accepted Galen's theory of the four humours, believing that health depended on balance between blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Treatments included bloodletting, purging, and herbal remedies. The Church ran hospitals, but these mostly offered care and prayer rather than cures.

## Renaissance change
The Renaissance encouraged observation and challenge to old authorities. Andreas Vesalius improved anatomical knowledge through detailed human dissection. William Harvey described blood circulation in the 17th century, showing that blood was pumped around the body by the heart. Even with these advances, treatments often remained traditional and progress in public health was limited.

## Industrial period and public health
Industrialisation caused overcrowding, poor sanitation, and disease in towns. Edwin Chadwick's report linked poor living conditions to illness and argued for government intervention. The Public Health Act 1848 created local health boards, while the 1875 Act made sanitation measures more compulsory. These reforms reduced disease by improving water supply, sewers, and rubbish collection.

## Modern medicine
In the 20th century, science transformed diagnosis and treatment. Louis Pasteur's germ theory identified microorganisms as causes of disease, and Robert Koch linked specific microbes to specific illnesses. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, later developed for mass use during World War II. The NHS was founded in 1948, making healthcare available to everyone through taxation.

## Exam technique
For 12-mark and 16-mark questions, students should build a clear line of argument, compare factors across periods, and evaluate change and continuity. Use specific evidence such as named individuals, dates, and laws. Strong answers explain significance, not just description. A useful structure is Point-Evidence-Explain-Evaluate.
