# Elizabethan England (GCSE History AQA)

## Government and the monarchy
Elizabeth I ruled from 1558 to 1603 and used a combination of authority and political skill. She made use of her Privy Council and Parliament but retained strong control over key decisions. Problems included succession anxiety and threats from rival claimants like Mary, Queen of Scots.

## Religion
Elizabeth's Religious Settlement aimed for a moderate Protestant Church of England. The Act of Supremacy restored royal authority over the Church and the Act of Uniformity set rules for worship. Catholics and Puritans both challenged the settlement at different times. Conflict over religion was tied to politics and security.

## Exploration and conflict
England's rivalry with Spain intensified in the later years of Elizabeth's reign. Sir Francis Drake's voyages and privateering damaged Spanish shipping. The Spanish Armada of 1588 failed, which boosted Elizabeth's reputation, though war with Spain continued and remained expensive.

## Society and daily life
Population growth increased pressure on food, housing, and jobs. Poverty became a major concern, and governments introduced Poor Laws to organise local relief. Entertainment, theatre, and festivals remained important parts of life, while social hierarchy shaped opportunities and expectations.

## Exam technique
When answering causation questions, rank causes and explain interactions between them. For significance questions, focus on why an event mattered at the time and in the longer term. Use specific examples such as the Armada campaign, the Religious Settlement, and Poor Law measures.
