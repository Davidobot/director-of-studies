# UK Parliament, MPs and how laws are made (GCSE Citizenship Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## An overview of the UK political system
The United Kingdom operates a parliamentary democracy in which elected representatives make decisions on behalf of citizens. At the centre of that system sits Parliament at Westminster, made up of two Houses and working alongside the government, the civil service and an independent judiciary. The government is formed from the party, or coalition of parties, that can command the confidence of the House of Commons; ministers set policy and propose laws while Parliament debates, amends and authorises those proposals. The UK does not have a single written constitution. Instead its constitutional rules and principles come from a mixture of statute law, decisions of the courts (common law), long‑standing conventions and some modern documents. This uncodified nature means that practices can change over time, which is why understanding the roles and powers of each institution is important for citizens who want to take part in democratic life.

## Who runs the country: elections, parties and MPs
General elections choose Members of Parliament (MPs) to represent constituencies across the UK. Most general elections use the first‑past‑the‑post system, where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins; this tends to produce single‑party governments but can exaggerate the number of seats for the largest party compared with its share of the national vote. Political parties shape the options voters choose between: parties set policies, select candidates to stand in constituencies and organise campaigns. Once elected, MPs have two linked roles. Nationally, they contribute to debates, vote on laws and scrutinise government policy. Locally, they represent the views and problems of people in their area by holding surgeries, making enquiries to government departments and raising constituents’ issues in Parliament. Party discipline matters because many votes follow the party line, enforced by whips, but backbench MPs (those not in ministerial or official opposition roles) retain the power to question, criticise and sometimes rebel.

## How Parliament works: Commons, Lords and the Crown
Parliament has three distinct parts that perform different functions. The House of Commons is the elected chamber where government is formed and where most political debate about policy and money happens. The House of Lords is a revising chamber composed largely of life peers, some bishops and a small number of hereditary peers; its main role is to scrutinise, suggest amendments and delay but not permanently block most legislation. The Crown, embodied by the monarch, has largely ceremonial duties in modern practice: the monarch gives formal approval to bills passed by both Houses, known as royal assent. Parliamentary business is supported by committees that examine specific policy areas, scrutinise the work of government departments and take evidence from experts and the public. These committees are central to holding ministers to account and can influence policy by producing detailed reports. The separation between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary is a key principle: although government ministers sit in Parliament, they are accountable to it, and the courts can review whether ministers have acted within the law.

## The journey of a bill: from idea to law
Making law in the UK is a step‑by‑step process that gives MPs and peers multiple opportunities to examine proposals. A bill can begin as a government bill, a private member’s bill, or from a member or peer with particular interest in an issue. The main stages are introduction and first reading, where the bill’s title is presented; second reading, where its main principles are debated; committee stage, where detailed line‑by‑line scrutiny and amendments happen; report stage, allowing further consideration of amendments; and third reading, which focuses on the final text. After one House completes these stages the bill moves to the other House for the same process. If both Houses agree, the bill is presented to the monarch for royal assent and becomes law. Some laws also rely on secondary legislation, such as statutory instruments, which allows ministers to make more detailed rules under powers given by an Act of Parliament. Private members’ bills and pressure group campaigns sometimes lead to law changes by highlighting issues and persuading MPs and peers to support reforms, showing that law‑making is not only a top‑down process.

## Parliament, public money and the role of the Chancellor
One of Parliament’s most important functions is controlling public money. The government proposes how taxes are raised and how public spending is allocated; these proposals are set out in budgets written and presented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Parliament must authorise taxation and major spending through votes on budget measures and supply bills. MPs and committees scrutinise how money is used and can question whether the government is prioritising services such as health, education and welfare appropriately. Debates about taxation and spending often reflect different political views about the size and role of the state, fairness and the best way to meet social needs. Understanding this process helps citizens see where decisions about everyday public services are made and how to influence them.

## Holding government to account and routes of influence
Holding those in power to account is a central part of parliamentary democracy. MPs use questions, debates and votes to challenge ministers, with the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions offering a high‑profile example where the prime minister answers MPs’ questions. Select committees investigate specific departments, publish reports, summon witnesses and judge whether public policy is working. Backbench business and opposition days provide further pressure points where MPs can spotlight local or national concerns. Outside Parliament, citizens and organisations influence MPs through petitions, letters, meetings, demonstrations and membership of interest groups. The media plays a role by reporting issues and investigating matters of public interest, while pressure groups and charities use research and campaigning to change public opinion and persuade MPs to act. This network of formal and informal accountability is what allows democratic systems to respond and adapt to citizens’ needs.

## Devolution, the constitution and the wider context
Power is shared across the United Kingdom through devolution. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own legislatures with the power to make laws in devolved areas such as education, health and transport, while Westminster retains responsibility for reserved matters like defence and foreign policy. Devolution has changed how laws are made in the UK and added a layer of complexity when policies differ between the parts of the UK. The constitution’s mix of statutes, judicial decisions, conventions and historical documents means that constitutional change can be gradual and often the product of political debate and legal decisions rather than a single written charter. International relationships, including the UK’s post‑Brexit relationship with Europe, also affect parliamentary work because Parliament sometimes has to consider the impact of international agreements on domestic law. Citizens learning about Parliament should therefore pay attention to how laws are shaped not only at Westminster but across the devolved institutions and by international commitments.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on Parliament, MPs and law‑making, start by identifying which assessment objective the question targets. For knowledge questions (AO1) give clear, precise explanations of terms and institutions: define what a bill, an MP or parliamentary sovereignty is before expanding. For application questions (AO2) link your knowledge to the context provided in the question or source; describe specific processes such as the stages a bill passes through and show how these stages would apply to the example in the question. For analysis and evaluation (AO3) balance strengths and weaknesses, compare viewpoints, and reach a justified judgement. Use the PEEL approach in each paragraph: make a point, explain it, provide evidence or an example (this could be a hypothetical or a real process such as a select committee inquiry), and link back to the question. When a source booklet is provided, read the source carefully and use it to support your points rather than replace them; refer to the source to show you have understood different perspectives but expand beyond the source using your subject knowledge. Manage your time by allocating minutes to marks, leaving a short plan for longer 12‑ or 15‑mark answers, and leave time at the end to check that you have answered every part of the question. For questions about your citizenship action in Paper 2, base your answers on the evidence and reflections from your investigation, describe the research methods you used, the choices you made and evaluate the impact in relation to the goals you set. Always aim for clarity, structured paragraphs and a short concluding sentence on longer responses to show you have reached a reasoned conclusion.
