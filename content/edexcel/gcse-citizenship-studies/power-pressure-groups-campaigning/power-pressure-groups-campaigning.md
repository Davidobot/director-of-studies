# Power, pressure groups and campaigning (GCSE Citizenship Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Understanding power and influence
Power in politics and society is the ability to make things happen, shape decisions, or change how people think and act. It can be visible, such as when governments pass laws, or more subtle, such as when a well‑timed campaign changes public opinion. Influence is the softer side of power: persuading others, shaping debate and shifting priorities without necessarily holding official authority. For citizens studying GCSE Citizenship, it helps to think about power at three levels: individual power (what one person can achieve), collective power (what groups, organisations and communities can do together) and institutional power (what government, courts, police and international organisations can do). Recognising these different forms of power makes it easier to understand how change happens and where opportunities for action exist.

## How citizens can exercise power
Citizens exercise power in many ways, ranging from formal democratic acts to everyday contribution in their communities. Casting a vote in a general election or referendum is the clearest example of formal influence in a representative democracy. Standing for local councils, joining a political party, or contacting an MP are other formal routes to affect decision making. Beyond formal channels, people can campaign, petition, lobby decision‑makers, take part in demonstrations, engage in community projects, or use social media to raise awareness. Each route has strengths and limits: voting is powerful but infrequent, lobbying can be effective but often requires access and expertise, and demonstrations can draw public attention but do not guarantee policy change. Barriers to participation—such as lack of time, resources, knowledge, or perceived powerlessness—are real and important to understand; overcoming them often involves collaboration, building skills and choosing the right method for the goal.

## Pressure groups and interest organisations
Pressure groups and interest organisations are central to how citizens pool influence. These groups vary widely in purpose and methods, from trade unions representing workers’ rights to single‑issue campaigners focusing on the environment or human rights. A useful way to categorise pressure groups is by whether they are sectional, representing a particular group (for example, a professional association), or promotional, campaigning for a wider cause (for example, an environmental charity). Some pressure groups are “insider” groups with regular access to decision‑makers and the ability to influence policy through negotiation and evidence, while “outsider” groups operate mainly outside formal channels, using public campaigning or direct action to build pressure. Trade unions are a classic example of sectional groups that use negotiation and collective bargaining. Environmental organisations often combine research, public campaigns and legal action to press for change. Understanding the aims, resources and strategies of different groups helps explain why some succeed and others struggle.

## Campaigning methods and planning effective action
Successful campaigning starts with clear research and a concrete goal. Effective campaigns identify a specific problem, gather reliable evidence, decide who has the power to change the situation, and design tactics aimed at that decision‑maker or audience. Research can be secondary, using published reports and statistics, or primary, using surveys, interviews and local observations; GCSE students practising their own citizenship action will use both. Planning involves setting realistic objectives, choosing a target audience, allocating roles within a team, and selecting methods that fit the goal—whether that is raising awareness, changing a policy, or providing a community service. Methods can include lobbying politicians, running public meetings, producing leaflets, organising petitions or peaceful protests, staging awareness events, or using social media to reach a wider audience. Fundraising and partnerships can increase impact, and careful record‑keeping is essential both for evaluating progress and for exam evidence. After the action, critical evaluation asks what worked, what didn’t and why, and this reflection is central to improving future campaigning and demonstrating learning in assessment.

## The role of the media and regulation
The media and digital platforms shape what people know and how they form opinions, so they are powerful players in any democratic system. A free press is important because it informs the public, investigates wrongdoing and holds those in power to account. However, the media must balance the right to report with responsibilities to be accurate and to respect privacy. In the UK there are systems of regulation and standards designed to encourage responsible journalism and to provide remedies when reporting is unfair. Increasingly, social media is the arena where ideas spread quickly and where campaigning can go viral. Digital tools make it easier for ordinary people to create content, mobilise supporters and target messages precisely, but they also make the spread of false information easier. For campaigners, understanding how traditional journalism works alongside digital communication is crucial: a well‑crafted social media campaign can amplify an issue that then attracts mainstream media coverage, while careful outreach to journalists can turn research into influential stories.

## Power beyond the UK: NGOs, international organisations and the limits of influence
Power and influence are not only domestic. The UK interacts with international institutions and other countries, and these relationships shape national policies and citizens’ lives. International organisations such as the United Nations, NATO, the World Trade Organization and regional bodies have different roles, from peacekeeping to trade regulation and humanitarian coordination. Non‑governmental organisations (NGOs) also play a vital role by providing aid, highlighting human rights abuses and pressuring governments and international bodies to act. The UK’s influence abroad can include diplomacy, development aid, participation in international coalitions and contributions to peacekeeping. But influence has limits. Sovereignty, competing national interests, international law and the need for multilateral agreement can constrain what any single country can achieve. The example of how trade, migration and travel arrangements changed after the UK left the European Union shows how international relationships can be renegotiated with wide-ranging effects. Studying these wider contexts helps students appreciate that local campaigns can link to global systems and that international law and organisations offer avenues for action as well as constraints.

## Taking part: linking classroom learning to real action
One of the most important parts of GCSE Citizenship is learning by doing. Taking citizenship action means planning and carrying out an informed, realistic activity that aims to make a difference. This might be a local project to improve recycling, a school awareness campaign on mental health, a petition to a local council, or a fundraising effort for a charity. The stages of an effective action include identifying the issue, researching it, deciding on goals, planning the activity with clear roles and timescales, delivering the action while working as a team, and evaluating the results. Students should be prepared to explain their choices and reflect on outcomes: what evidence supported the action, how did different people react, what barriers were encountered and what was learned about citizenship and power. Centres will require confirmation that the action was the students’ own work, so accurate records, photographs, witness statements and a short, clear title are important. In examinations, answers that connect theory (how power works) to a specific, realistic action will score highly; linking classroom concepts to practical experience demonstrates deeper understanding.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on power, pressure groups and campaigning, start by reading the question carefully and identifying which assessment objective is targeted: knowledge and understanding (AO1), application to contexts (AO2) or analysis and evaluation (AO3). For AO1 questions give clear definitions and explain key concepts such as pressure groups, insider/outsider status, lobbying, or forms of power. For AO2 tasks always apply theory to a context or example; if you have carried out citizenship action, use concrete details from your project to show how strategies were chosen and what impact was intended. For AO3 responses plan a short structure before you write: introduce the issue, present different viewpoints or pieces of evidence, analyse their strengths and weaknesses, and finish with a reasoned judgement. When asked to evaluate effectiveness, consider both strengths and limitations and support judgements with evidence or logical reasoning. Use the language of cause and effect (for example, “because”, “therefore”, “as a result”) and make sure each paragraph has a clear point linked back to the question. For longer essays, aim for clarity and balance: compare methods, explain differing outcomes, and conclude by answering the question directly. Practice with past source-based questions by identifying the source’s perspective, testing its reliability, and using it alongside your own knowledge. Finally, time manage during the exam so you can plan, write and briefly check your answers; quality of analysis beats quantity of unsupported statements.
