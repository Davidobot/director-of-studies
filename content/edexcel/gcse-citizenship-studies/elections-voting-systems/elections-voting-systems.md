# Elections and voting systems (GCSE Citizenship Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: why elections and voting systems matter
Elections are the core mechanism through which citizens choose who will make decisions on their behalf. The voting system chosen affects how votes are translated into seats, which parties gain power, and how well different opinions in society are represented. For GCSE Citizenship Studies it is important to understand both the practical rules of UK elections and the broader debates they raise: how fairness, effectiveness and accountability are balanced; why some people feel represented while others feel their vote is wasted; and how different systems encourage different kinds of politics. Knowing these ideas helps you evaluate real-world examples, make reasoned arguments and understand the role of citizens in a democracy.

## Representative and direct democracy: the basic distinction
Most of the UK’s political system is based on representative democracy, which means people elect representatives—MPs, councillors or members of devolved assemblies—to make decisions on their behalf. Representative democracy is efficient for large societies and allows elected officials to develop expertise and take responsibility. Direct democracy, by contrast, involves citizens voting directly on specific issues through referendums. Referendums have been used in the UK for major constitutional questions and local issues, most notably the 2016 referendum on EU membership. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses: representative democracy supports day-to-day decision-making and accountability at elections, while direct democracy can give a clear mandate on single issues but risks oversimplifying complex topics.

## How UK elections work in practice
General elections for the UK Parliament usually decide the national government. Most voters in UK general elections must be 18 or over, and there are specific rules about who is eligible depending on the election type: some devolved elections and certain referendums have allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to vote. Elections are organised by returning officers and monitored by an independent Electoral Commission, which publishes guidance, sets campaign spending rules and tries to ensure fairness. Political parties choose or select candidates to stand in constituencies; independent candidates may also stand. Elections can be regular or triggered by specific circumstances such as the collapse of a government, and by-elections happen when an individual MP resigns or is otherwise unable to continue. Voter registration, postal votes, proxy votes and polling stations are the practical features that make elections accessible; debates about turnout and barriers to participation are part of wider citizenship questions.

## First‑past‑the‑post explained
First‑past‑the‑post (FPTP) is the system used in UK general elections. Each constituency elects one MP and the candidate with the most votes wins the seat, even if they do not have an absolute majority. This simplicity produces clear local links between MPs and their constituents and often creates single‑party governments that can be stable and decisive. However, FPTP can produce disproportional outcomes in terms of national votes compared with seats. For example, in the 2015 general election the UK Independence Party took about 12.6% of the national vote but won only one seat because its support was spread thinly across constituencies rather than concentrated. The system encourages tactical voting in marginal seats and can leave many votes “wasted” where a large number of votes do not contribute to electing any candidate. Those features lead to debates over fairness and representation that are central to GCSE study.

## Alternative voting systems and where they are used
There are several alternative systems designed to make election results more proportional or to give voters more choice. Proportional representation (PR) systems aim to allocate seats roughly in proportion to the share of the vote each party receives. One common method is the party list system, where parties present ranked lists of candidates and seats are allocated according to vote share; this approach was used for European Parliament elections when the UK participated. The Additional Member System (AMS) combines constituency representatives elected by FPTP with regional “top‑up” members from party lists and is used for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Senedd; AMS keeps local representation while producing more proportional overall outcomes. The Single Transferable Vote (STV) has multi-member constituencies, voters rank candidates in order of preference, and surplus or eliminated votes are transferred to reach quotas; STV is used in Northern Ireland and in Scottish local elections. The Supplementary Vote (SV) allows voters to indicate a first and second choice and is used for some mayoral elections. Each system influences party behaviour, coalition-building and how minority viewpoints are represented; GCSE questions often ask you to compare these effects and give examples of where different systems apply.

## Forming government and the role of Parliament and MPs
After a general election the leader of the party with the most seats is usually invited by the monarch to form a government as prime minister. If a single party has a majority of seats, it normally forms a majority government; if no party has a majority, parties may form a coalition or a minority government that relies on support from other groups. Parliament’s two Houses—the Commons and the Lords—scrutinise government proposals, debate public issues and shape legislation. MPs represent local interests, raise constituents’ concerns, sit on committees and take part in debates. The prime minister and ministers run government departments and are accountable to Parliament. Understanding these roles helps explain why the voting system matters: it determines who sits in Parliament and therefore who is able to form a government and set policy.

## Debates and criticisms: turnout, fairness and reform
The design of electoral systems raises continuing debates. One recurring issue is turnout: some argue that low participation shows a disengaged electorate, while others point to practical barriers or a lack of compelling choices. Another debate concerns fairness and proportionality. Critics of FPTP point to unbalanced results, regional distortions and under‑representation of smaller parties, while supporters emphasise decisive government and a clear link between MPs and their constituencies. The idea of extending the vote to 16‑ and 17‑year‑olds has been proposed to boost engagement, and different elections already use different age rules, which fuels discussion about consistency and civic responsibility. Tactical voting, where people vote not for their preferred candidate but for the most likely challenger to an undesired candidate, is common in FPTP and is seen by some as a democratic workaround and by others as a distortion. Proposals for reform—ranging from adopting AMS or STV nationally to keeping FPTP—must weigh competing values such as stability, diversity of representation, simplicity and public trust. Being able to explain these trade‑offs and refer to real examples—such as how UKIP’s 2015 vote share did not translate into seats, or how coalition governments have operated after elections in 2010 and in other PR systems—will strengthen your analysis in the exam.

## Connecting elections to citizen action
Elections are only one way citizens influence public life. Campaigning, joining pressure groups, volunteering, petitioning and demonstrations are all methods people use to shape outcomes between elections. Digital tools and social media have also changed how parties campaign and how voters receive information, raising new questions about regulation, misinformation and the role of the media in a democracy. For GCSE Citizenship Studies, it is useful to link knowledge of voting systems with examples of how citizens organise to change policy or hold representatives to account. Local elections, petitions, and participation in campaigns can be direct components of citizenship action projects and help students understand the practical effects of electoral rules.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about elections and voting systems, start by making sure you understand the command word and allocate your time accordingly. For short knowledge questions, give a clear definition or description and, where possible, use a short example to show understanding. For questions that ask you to explain or apply knowledge to a context, describe the relevant feature (for example: how first‑past‑the‑post works) and then link it directly to the scenario or source provided. For 6‑mark and 12‑mark questions expect to provide more depth: begin with a brief introduction that defines key terms, present balanced arguments with evidence or examples (such as UK election results, referendums or devolved systems), and finish with a short judgement that answers the question directly. When a source is supplied, use it: extract the main points and combine them with your own knowledge, showing how the source supports or challenges those points. For evaluation-style questions, aim to compare at least two perspectives, explain advantages and disadvantages, and conclude with a reasoned opinion that summarises the strongest arguments. Finally, plan your answer quickly so your writing is structured, label any examples clearly, and check that every paragraph links back to the question to gain full credit for AO1, AO2 and AO3 skills.
