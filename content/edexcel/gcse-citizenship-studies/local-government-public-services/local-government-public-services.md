# Local government and public services (GCSE Citizenship Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview of local government and why it matters
Local government is the level of government closest to people's everyday lives. It is responsible for delivering many of the services people rely on in their communities and for making decisions that shape local places. Understanding local government helps you see how public money is spent, how local priorities are set, and how residents can influence decisions that affect housing, schools, streets, parks and care services. Where national government sets broad policies and laws, local government translates those policies into practical services and local plans. This means that learning how councils work — and how citizens can take part — is essential for active citizenship.

## Types of councils and how responsibilities are split
Councils in the UK are organised in different ways depending on the area. In some places a single unitary council carries out all local services. In other areas there is a two-tier system in which a county council provides services such as education, social care and strategic transport, while district or borough councils handle housing, local planning, waste collection and environmental health. London is governed by the Greater London Authority and the Mayor of London, supported by the London Assembly, while parish and town councils exist in many smaller communities to manage very local amenities such as allotments, community halls and parks. The specific responsibilities of each type of council vary, but the important point is that local government is not uniform across the UK; its structure reflects historical development and local choice.

## Who makes decisions: councillors, officers and decision-making models
Elected councillors are the political figures who represent local residents, set council policy and make decisions about local priorities. Councillors are responsible for representing the views of people in their ward, attending council meetings, and often holding "surgeries" where residents can raise problems. Council officers are professional, paid employees who deliver services and provide specialist advice. Officers manage day-to-day administration, prepare reports, run procurement processes and ensure legal compliance. Decision-making within councils can take different forms: some councils operate a leader-and-cabinet model where the cabinet makes executive decisions, others use committees where decisions are taken in committee meetings, and some areas have a directly elected mayor who holds strong executive powers. There are also checks and balances inside councils, such as overview and scrutiny committees, that examine how decisions are made and held to account.

## What local councils provide and how services are delivered
Local councils cover a wide range of public services. Typical responsibilities include waste collection and recycling, housing and homelessness support, local planning and building control, environmental health, leisure facilities and parks, public libraries, some aspects of road maintenance and street lighting, and social services for children and adults. Councils also play a role in public health, trading standards and emergency planning. Some services, especially education and the NHS, involve both national policy and local delivery, so the lines can be complex: councils may have responsibilities for school admissions and some school support services while many schools are now academies, and the NHS provides healthcare nationally but works with local authorities on public health and social care. Increasingly councils work with charities, community groups, businesses and private contractors to deliver services, which can bring specialist skills but also raises questions about accountability and quality.

## Paying for local services: funding streams and pressures
Councils are funded through a combination of council tax, business rates, central government grants and fees and charges for services. Council tax is paid by households and is often the most visible local tax; discounts and exemptions apply in certain circumstances. Business rates are levied on non-domestic properties and are partly retained locally but often pooled and redistributed. Central government grants have historically been a substantial source of income, but reductions in these grants in recent years have placed significant pressures on local budgets. Councils also generate income from charges for services, rents from council-owned properties, and from capital receipts. When funding is tight, councils must make difficult choices about which services to protect and which to reduce, and this can lead to visible changes such as reduced opening hours for libraries or changes to care packages. Understanding where money comes from helps explain why some local decisions are controversial and why public consultation is important.

## How citizens can hold local government to account and get involved
There are many ways for residents to influence local government beyond voting in local elections. Writing to or meeting your local councillor can raise concerns about specific problems, while petitions, public consultations and neighbourhood planning provide formal pathways to shape decisions. Attending council meetings gives direct insight into debates and allows members of the public to speak on certain issues. Local scrutiny committees, independent auditors, and the Local Government Ombudsman exist to investigate maladministration or unfair treatment. In addition, citizens can use freedoms such as the Freedom of Information Act to request information, or pursue judicial review as a legal way of challenging decisions that are unlawful. Pressure groups, charities and residents’ associations also play an important role by campaigning, gathering evidence, and mobilising public opinion. For young people, school councils and youth forums are practical routes to engage with local decision-making and build a record of active citizenship.

## Current challenges and examples affecting local services
Local government faces a range of contemporary challenges which influence how services are delivered. Funding constraints after periods of central budget cuts have forced many councils to prioritise statutory services such as adult social care and children’s services, while discretionary services may be reduced. Outsourcing services to private contractors has been used to achieve savings, but cases of poor contract management have shown risks to service quality. Rapid population growth in some areas creates demand for new schools and housing, while rural areas face different pressures such as higher service delivery costs and transport issues. Devolution of powers to cities and regions has shifted some responsibilities and can lead to innovation, but it also requires careful co-operation between local and central government. Recent policy changes at national level, such as reforms to adult social care funding or changes to planning rules, have direct impacts on councils, illustrating how local and national government interact in practice.

## Taking action locally: practical ideas for students and schools
Students can apply the GCSE citizenship framework by planning and carrying out a local citizenship action that addresses an issue in their community. A practical campaign might begin with research to establish the scale of a problem, followed by contacting councillors, arranging a meeting with a council officer, or organising a public awareness event. Actions can be advocacy-focused, such as a petition to retain a library, or service-focused, like running a community clean-up or setting up a resource bank for people in need. Working with local charities, faith groups or community organisations can strengthen impact and provide access to expertise. It is important to set realistic goals, keep records of research and decisions, reflect on differences in perspective among stakeholders, and evaluate what was achieved. This practical experience not only meets the course requirement for taking citizenship action but also demonstrates how local government and public services respond to community needs.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on local government and public services, begin by showing clear knowledge: define key terms such as councillor, council tax, unitary authority or devolution where relevant. For application questions, use a local example or a practical scenario to show how the concepts play out in real life — describing how a council might fund and decide on a new youth centre, or how residents could challenge a planning decision, scores valuable AO2 marks. For evaluation questions, present balanced arguments that consider strengths and weaknesses: for example, weigh the benefits of outsourcing against issues of accountability and cost, or contrast unitary and two-tier systems in terms of clarity of responsibility. Always support your points with reasons and, where possible, evidence drawn from your own citizenship action or from local case studies. For extended answers, structure your response with a brief introduction, clear paragraphs each focusing on one idea, and a concluding judgment that answers the question directly. Pay attention to command words: explain requires detail and development, assess and evaluate ask for a judgement that considers different viewpoints, and describe needs clear factual information. Manage your time so you leave enough time to plan and check longer responses, and make your writing legible and focused so that examiners can follow your reasoning easily.
