# Taking citizenship action: planning and evaluation (GCSE Citizenship Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## What is citizenship action and why it matters
Citizenship action is a planned, evidence-based activity carried out by students to address a real-life citizenship issue, with the intention of delivering some tangible benefit or change for a community. It is more than a one-off school exercise: it asks you to research an issue, understand different viewpoints, design and deliver an activity, and then judge how effective that activity was. By taking citizenship action you apply the ideas and concepts you learn in class — democracy, rights, responsibility, participation and community — to practical problems in local, national or global contexts. The process builds useful skills such as research, teamwork, problem solving, communication and evaluation, and gives you concrete experiences to discuss in the examination. Exam boards value authentic work that demonstrates the links between knowledge and real-world practice, so choosing an issue you care about and framing it clearly will make your work more meaningful and easier to explain.

## The stages of planning and carrying out action
A successful citizenship action follows a clear sequence: identify an issue, research it, decide the goals, plan the activity, carry out the action, and evaluate the results. The first stage is to identify a real problem or opportunity related to your course content, for example local littering, lack of youth provision, mental health awareness, or access to information about voting. Once you have an issue, form a small team and carry out secondary research to understand the background: who is affected, which organisations are already involved, and what previous attempts have been made. Next, develop research questions that primary research (surveys, interviews, observations) will help you answer. Use the evidence you gather to decide what kind of activity is realistic and likely to have impact. Plan clearly by naming your target audience, setting measurable goals and allocating roles and timescales. Deliver the action professionally and record what you do and the evidence of outcomes. Finally, evaluate critically: compare your outcomes with your goals, use your evidence to explain what worked and why, and reflect on what you would change next time. Being methodical at each stage makes your action more credible and provides the material you will need for the exam.

## Research: primary and secondary methods that work
Research underpins every good citizenship action. Secondary research means using existing sources such as government statistics, reports from local councils or charities, news articles and relevant academic or organisational publications. This gives you context and helps you design better primary research. Primary research is information you gather directly to answer your specific questions: surveys of local residents, interviews with stakeholders, observation of a site, short polls on social media, or informal focus groups. When planning primary research choose methods appropriate to your questions. Surveys can provide quick quantitative measures, interviews or focus groups give depth and nuance, and observations show behaviour rather than stated preference. Think about sampling: try to reach a variety of people who represent the community affected by your issue and be open about limitations in your data. Ethical concerns matter: always explain why you are collecting information, obtain consent for interviews or photographs, protect personal data and respect privacy. Record your methods and results carefully: raw data, annotated photographs, completed questionnaires and interview summaries are all valid evidence. In the exam you will be expected to refer to this evidence to justify decisions and show learning, so reliable and well-documented research strengthens both your action and your answers.

## Project planning and practical organisation
Good planning turns an idea into a deliverable project. Start by setting clear, realistic objectives and criteria for success: what will you measure, and how will you know if the activity has helped? Use timeframes and break the work into tasks with named responsibilities so everyone on the team understands their role. Practical issues such as venue booking, permissions from the school or local authority, budgeting and risk assessment should be addressed early. Keep records of permissions and any correspondence that relates to the project, as these are important pieces of evidence. Consider resources: materials, publicity, transport and any insurance or safeguarding requirements. Contingency planning is also important; think through possible obstacles such as bad weather for an outdoor event or low attendance and how you would respond. Throughout, maintain a log of decisions and progress so that your evaluation can trace the reasoning behind each choice. Where digital tools are used — for surveys, social media promotion or online petitions — save screenshots, download analytics and archive posts to demonstrate reach and engagement.

## Delivering your action: teamwork, methods and examples
Delivering the action is where planning meets practice. Teamwork and collaboration are central: apply negotiation, delegation and communication skills so work is shared fairly and tasks are completed on time. There are several types of action you might choose. Advocacy activities aim to change opinion or influence decision makers and could include meetings with councillors, letter-writing campaigns, petitions, or public awareness events. Campaigns focus on publicity and persuasion and often use social media, posters and events to inform and mobilise people. Social action projects deliver a direct benefit, such as organising a food drive, creating a community garden, or running a drop-in advice session. Social enterprises aim to combine an income-generating activity with social benefit, for example raising funds through a fairtrade stall to support a local charity. Wherever possible, target your activity at the people who can make a difference or who will benefit most, and be specific about the change you want to see. Document the delivery with attendance lists, photographs, minutes from meetings, copies of promotional material and quantitative measures such as numbers of leaflets distributed or signatures collected. These records make it much easier to demonstrate impact later.

## Evaluating impact and learning from your action
Evaluation is not an optional extra; it is central to learning. A critical evaluation compares planned aims with what actually happened and uses evidence to explain successes and failures. Begin by restating your objectives and the criteria you set for judging success. Then present the data you collected during and after the activity: survey results, attendance figures, feedback comments, photos and any follow-up actions by the target audience or authorities. Use this evidence to assess the effect of your action on the intended beneficiaries and on your own learning. Consider the effectiveness of your methods: did your research accurately identify needs, was your publicity sufficient, and were your resources used efficiently? Explain what you would do differently in future, showing an understanding of limitations and possible improvements. Reflect on personal and team learning such as negotiation, leadership, problem solving and resilience; honest self-critique demonstrates maturity and is valued by examiners. Remember that an action that did not achieve all its aims can still provide rich evidence of learning, provided your evaluation explains why things did not go as expected and how you would adapt next time.

## Assessment requirements, authentication and common pitfalls
For Pearson Edexcel GCSE Citizenship Studies your citizenship action is assessed through Paper 2 and contributes 15% of the qualification. In the exam you will answer questions based on the action you carried out and you must supply a concise title for your action of no more than 20 words. The exam tasks expect you to apply knowledge (AO2) and analyse and evaluate evidence and viewpoints (AO3) using the real project as your context. Your centre must confirm that the work submitted for assessment is your own by completing a teacher declaration form; failing to submit this form or falsifying evidence is treated as malpractice. Common pitfalls include poor record-keeping, unclear aims, weak primary research, inadequate ethical considerations and insufficient reflection. To avoid these, keep orderly records of every stage of your project: research notes, copies of questionnaires, photos with dates and captions, minutes, emails about permissions, and a clear log of team roles and decisions. When planning, be realistic about what can be achieved in the time and with the resources you have. Ensure all participants understand safeguarding and consent protocols and obtain permissions where required. Remember that examiners are interested in your reasoning and the evidence supporting it, so good documentation and a candid evaluation improve your performance even if the action did not fully meet its goals.

## Exam technique
When answering Paper 2 questions about your own citizenship action, begin by reading the question carefully and planning how your evidence maps to it. Start short responses by stating clearly what you did, who was involved and the intended aim, then support that statement with specific evidence from your records. For medium and longer responses, structure your answers so they include a clear claim, evidence from your project (for example, survey figures, attendance numbers, written feedback or examples of media coverage), and an explanation of what that evidence shows. Examiners reward precise, relevant examples and clear links to citizenship concepts such as participation, representation, rights or community cohesion. For evaluation questions allocate time to identify strengths and weaknesses, using your success criteria to judge outcomes, then explain what you would change and why. Be explicit about methods: name the primary research tools you used, outline your sampling approach and acknowledge limitations. When asked to present different viewpoints, summarise other people’s perspectives fairly and explain why you or your team favoured one course of action over another, using evidence to justify your choice. Keep your 20-word title tight, descriptive and focused on the issue and aim; practise writing this clearly in advance. Time management is vital: allow longer for the 12-mark and 15-mark tasks and plan paragraphs before you write so your argument flows logically. Use subject vocabulary correctly and link your evaluation to broader themes where relevant, for example how your action related to local democracy or human rights. Finally, rehearse past-style questions using your actual project evidence so you can quickly locate the most persuasive examples in the exam and present them with confidence.
