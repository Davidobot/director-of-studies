# Criminal, civil and youth justice (GCSE Citizenship Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: why law and justice matter
Law shapes the way we live together: it protects people and property, settles disputes, and sets limits on behaviour so that everyone can live with a degree of safety and fairness. At GCSE level you will study why laws exist, where they come from and the principles that make a legal system legitimate in a democracy. You will also look in detail at how the justice system works in England and Wales, how criminal and civil cases differ, the special arrangements made for young people, and the purposes and effects of different kinds of punishment. Understanding these ideas helps you to think critically about questions such as whether the law is fair, how to balance rights and responsibilities, and what kinds of punishments are effective in reducing crime.

## What law is for and how laws are made
Laws exist to protect people from harm, to settle disputes, to prevent discrimination, and to respond to new social and technological challenges. The legal system is guided by core principles: the rule of law, which means that everyone is subject to the law; the presumption of innocence, which places the burden of proof on the prosecution in criminal trials; equality before the law; and the idea of access to justice so citizens can use the legal system. In England and Wales laws are created in two main ways. Primary legislation, Acts of Parliament, are laws passed by Parliament. Case law, or common law, develops when judges make decisions in individual cases and later courts follow those decisions as precedent. Understanding the difference between statute and precedent helps you to see how the law can both reflect political choices and adapt over time through court rulings. It is also important to remember that the UK’s legal arrangements are not identical across the whole country: Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own legal systems and procedures.

## Criminal justice: the police, courts and trial process
Criminal law exists to protect the public from behaviour that causes harm, such as assault, theft or serious violent offences. The police investigate suspected crimes and have powers to arrest, search and gather evidence, but citizens also have legal protections at arrest: to be told the reason for arrest, to inform someone of their detention and to consult a solicitor. Once charged, most less serious offences start in the magistrates’ court. More serious cases are tried in the Crown Court with a jury. Magistrates’ courts are usually quicker and less formal; Crown Court trials involve a judge and jury and are used for indictable offences. In a criminal trial the prosecution must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt; the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty. If a case goes to trial it will include witness testimony, cross-examination and legal argument before a verdict is returned. Roles in the criminal justice system include police officers who investigate, prosecutors who decide charges, defence lawyers who represent defendants, magistrates and judges who determine guilt and sentence, and jurors who decide facts in serious trials. Citizens may participate as jurors, magistrates, or special constables, and these roles are part of how society helps to administer justice.

## Civil law, courts and alternatives to trial
Civil law is about resolving disputes between individuals, organisations or between citizens and public bodies. Typical civil cases involve contract disputes, debt claims, personal injury, or family matters such as divorce and child arrangements. Civil law does not seek to punish in the way criminal law does; instead, it aims to provide remedies that put a person back into the position they would have been in, as far as possible, had the wrongdoing not occurred. Civil cases are heard in county courts or the High Court depending on the seriousness and value of the claim. A different standard of proof applies in civil cases: the balance of probabilities, meaning a judge decides which version of events is more likely. Tribunals exist for specialist disputes, such as employment or immigration, and mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution are increasingly used because they can be quicker, cheaper and less adversarial. Teaching and classroom activities that simulate small claims or mediation can help you see how evidence and compromise play out in real situations.

## Youth justice: different rules for young people
Young people are treated differently by the justice system because of their age and developmental needs. The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10, which means children aged 10 and over can be held responsible for crimes, though the way they are dealt with emphasises welfare and rehabilitation more than adult sentencing. Youth courts are less formal than adult courts and aim to protect the identity of young defendants. Sentencing options reflect this focus, with measures such as youth rehabilitation orders, referral orders, and community-based programmes designed to address the causes of offending and to re-integrate young people into education and family life. The youth justice system recognises that education, mental health support and family circumstances are often central to preventing re-offending, so interventions tend to combine supervision with constructive support. When studying youth justice it is useful to compare this rehabilitative approach with more punitive responses and to consider evidence about what reduces re-offending.

## Sentencing, punishment and reducing crime
Sentences in the criminal system are designed with different aims in mind: to protect the public, to punish the offender, to deter others, to rehabilitate the offender, and to provide reparation to victims. Common types of sentence include custodial sentences (prison), community sentences (often called community payback or community orders), fines, and restorative justice measures which facilitate a meeting between victim and offender to agree reparative actions. Sentencing decisions take into account the seriousness of the offence, the harm caused, the offender’s level of responsibility and previous convictions. Debates about sentencing often focus on effectiveness: does prison reduce crime, or does it increase the risk of re-offending by disrupting education and employment? Strategies to reduce crime therefore combine prevention (tackling causes such as poverty and addiction), protection (measures that make crime harder to commit), and punishment or rehabilitation. Practical approaches that have evidence of success include targeted education and training for offenders, support for mental health and substance misuse, effective policing strategies, and programmes that help ex-offenders find stable housing and work.

## Rights, responsibilities and citizen roles in the justice system
The justice system is not only run by professionals; citizens have responsibilities and rights within it. You can contribute as a juror deciding a trial, as a magistrate making decisions on local cases, as a volunteer or special constable supporting the police, or as a witness who helps the court establish facts. Citizens also have civic duties, such as obeying the law, and responsibilities to respect others’ rights. The law balances competing rights: for example, freedom of speech must be weighed against protection from hate crimes or false accusations. Access to justice is a central concern: legal aid and the cost of representation affect whether people can enforce their rights. Equality before the law is another key idea, but in practice some groups may face barriers due to discrimination or lack of resources. Classroom debates, mock juries and case studies of real legal disputes give a practical sense of how rights and responsibilities interact and why public confidence in the fairness of the justice system matters.

## Practical examples and classroom activities
To make these concepts concrete, it helps to study real cases and practical examples. Discussing a burglary case shows the journey from police investigation to magistrates’ court or Crown Court. A civil case about a car accident illustrates how damages are calculated and the role of insurance. A youth justice scenario, such as an adolescent caught vandalising local property, can be used to explore restorative justice and youth rehabilitation programmes. Classroom activities that support learning include mock trials that require students to act as prosecution, defence and jury; debates about sentencing philosophy where students weigh retribution against rehabilitation; and small research projects on local policing and community safety initiatives. If students plan citizenship action projects, they might research community responses to anti-social behaviour or campaign for improved youth services, linking practical action to the theoretical concepts of law and justice studied in the course.

## Exam technique
In the exam, answer the question directly and use appropriate legal terminology. For knowledge-based questions (AO1) make sure you can clearly define terms such as rule of law, presumption of innocence, magistrates’ court, Crown Court, civil claim and restorative justice. For application questions (AO2) apply your knowledge to the context or source given: show how legal principles work in a scenario, refer to the correct court or procedure, and use specific examples where possible. For analysis and evaluation (AO3) weigh up different viewpoints, consider strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and reach a supported judgement. When tackling longer 12‑ or 15‑mark questions plan a brief structure: a clear introduction, two or three developed points with evidence or examples, consideration of alternative arguments, and a concise conclusion. Time management is essential: read the question carefully, annotate the source material if given, and allocate time according to the marks available. Use classroom examples and case studies you have practised as evidence in answers, and remember to link back to the big concepts—rights, responsibilities, fairness and effectiveness. For Paper 2, if you have completed a citizenship action, be ready to describe what you did succinctly and evaluate its impact; the exam will ask you to apply your experience to questions about planning, methods and outcomes, so prepare concise notes from your project to recall key facts and reflections under timed conditions.
