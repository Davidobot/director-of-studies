# The UK in the world: EU relations and international bodies (GCSE Citizenship Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Why the UK’s international role matters
Understanding how the UK fits into Europe and the rest of the world helps explain many of the big public debates you will study in Citizenship. Decisions about trade, migration, security and human rights are taken not only in Parliament but also in international bodies and through agreements with other countries. These decisions affect jobs, prices, travel rules, and how the UK responds to wars, humanitarian crises and global problems like climate change. For the purposes of your GCSE, it is useful to think about the different ways the UK exercises power: through formal membership of organisations, by working with others in coalitions, by using economic tools such as trade or sanctions, and by providing aid and diplomatic mediation.

## The UK and the European Union: the change from membership to partnership
For more than four decades the UK was a member of the European Union. EU membership involved shared rules about the single market, freedom of movement for people, and common policies on trade, fisheries and many other areas. A national referendum in 2016 led to the UK leaving the EU in 2020, an event commonly called “Brexit.” Leaving the EU changed the relationship in practical ways that are important to understand.

One key change is trade. While the UK and EU agreed a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the UK is no longer part of the EU single market and customs union. This means there are new customs checks, regulatory differences and paperwork for businesses when goods cross the UK–EU border. These changes have sometimes caused delays and increased costs, affecting exporters and importers, particularly small businesses.

Freedom of movement ended when the UK left the EU. EU citizens no longer have an automatic right to live and work in the UK, and UK citizens similarly lost the right to live and work in EU member states without meeting local immigration rules. The UK introduced a new points‑based immigration system that treats applicants from the EU and from outside the EU in the same way, prioritising skills and job offers. This has changed patterns of migration and raised debates about labour shortages in some sectors, such as health care and agriculture.

Fishing rights were another high profile area. During membership the UK shared fishing stocks under EU rules. After Brexit the UK regained control over its territorial waters, but access and quotas are now negotiated between the UK and the EU. These discussions have led to political disputes, because fishing communities often feel strongly about sovereignty and livelihoods, while the industry itself represents a relatively small part of the UK economy.

Travel rules also changed in practical ways. New passport and visa conditions, and checks at borders, have made some trips more complicated than before. While short visits for tourism remain relatively straightforward, longer stays, student exchanges and work placements are subject to immigration requirements set out by each country.

It is important to remember that the UK and EU still cooperate on many issues. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement includes arrangements on trade, fishing, security cooperation and data sharing, but the relationship is now governed by negotiations, agreements and diplomatic channels rather than by being part of the EU’s institutions.

## The European Union and the Council of Europe: what is the difference?
Students sometimes confuse the European Union with the Council of Europe. The EU is a political and economic union of member states that makes laws and has institutions such as the European Commission, European Parliament and the European Court of Justice. The Council of Europe is a separate, older organisation focused on human rights, democracy and the rule of law across Europe. The Council of Europe’s most widely known instrument is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg hears complaints that national courts have failed to protect rights guaranteed by the Convention.

When the UK left the EU it remained a member of the Council of Europe and remained bound by the ECHR, which underpins important rights protections in the UK, as incorporated into domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998. So, leaving the EU did not end the UK’s obligations under the ECHR. This distinction matters in questions about human rights, international courts and the checks on government.

## The UK and major international organisations: UN, NATO, Commonwealth and WTO
The United Kingdom is active in many international organisations, each with a different purpose. The United Nations is the main global forum for diplomacy, conflict resolution, peacekeeping and international development. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which gives it special responsibilities and influence in decisions about peace and security, sanctions and authorising peacekeeping missions.

NATO is a military alliance whose members agree collective defence. The UK is one of NATO’s leading members and contributes troops, equipment and funding to collective defence and exercises. NATO membership involves commitments under Article 5, the principle that an attack on one member is treated as an attack on all. This is central to UK defence policy and its relations with allies.

The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 56 independent countries, most of which were formerly part of the British Empire. Membership is not binding in the same way as NATO or the UN, but it provides a platform for diplomatic, cultural and development links across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific. For the UK, the Commonwealth offers opportunities for trade, education links and soft power.

The World Trade Organization oversees rules of international trade. The UK works within the WTO to settle trade disputes and to shape global trading rules. After leaving the EU the UK needed to negotiate its own trade agreements and to re-establish its voice in certain WTO discussions.

Together these memberships bring benefits—security guarantees, trade rules, a voice in global decisions and opportunities for cooperation—but they also bring obligations. The UK must meet financial contributions, follow agreed rules, and sometimes accept constraints on its freedom of action.

## International law, humanitarian law and human rights in conflict situations
International law is a set of rules and agreements between states. Treaties, conventions and customary international law create obligations that states accept when they sign and ratify agreements. Examples that matter for GCSE Citizenship include the Geneva Conventions, which form the basis of international humanitarian law and set out protections for civilians and combatants in armed conflicts, and international human rights treaties that set standards for governments in peacetime and war.

When conflicts occur, international law aims to limit suffering and protect human rights. International courts, such as the International Criminal Court, can investigate crimes like genocide and war crimes, although their reach depends on state cooperation. The UK is a party to many human rights and humanitarian treaties and has often supported international justice, though enforcing international law can be difficult and politically sensitive.

Humanitarian responses to crises also involve decisions about refugees and asylum. International law recognises the right of people to seek asylum from persecution, and many UK policies and international debates focus on how to balance protecting refugees with managing borders and security. These are complex ethical and political issues that often feature in Citizenship questions about rights and responsibilities.

## NGOs, sanctions, mediation and the methods of influence
The UK uses a mix of tools to influence international outcomes. Diplomacy is the routine method: ministers, ambassadors and negotiators work in international fora to reach agreements. When diplomacy is not enough, the UK may support sanctions—economic or travel restrictions—to pressure governments to change behaviour. Sanctions are widely used as a non‑military means to respond to actions such as human rights abuses or illegal aggression.

When violence breaks out, the UK may take part in or support humanitarian relief through non‑governmental organisations. NGOs such as the Red Cross, Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières operate on the ground, providing food, medical care and shelter, and they often call on governments for funding and political support. NGOs also play an important role in documenting human rights abuses and campaigning to influence public opinion and policy.

Force is a last resort in international politics. When used, it is typically justified by governments on the basis of self‑defence, international law or a UN mandate. The UK has participated in military interventions under a range of rationales and usually in coalition with allies. These choices involve heavy political and ethical trade‑offs, and the outcomes are often debated in Parliament and the public.

Mediation and peacekeeping are other ways the UK contributes. The UK may help negotiate ceasefires, support peace processes or contribute troops or police to UN peacekeeping missions. These roles depend on political will and resources, and they illustrate the variety of ways a country can influence events without resorting to force.

## Limits to UK influence and the debates this raises
Even though the UK is a major country, its power is not unlimited. Global problems require cooperation among many states, and different countries have different priorities. The UK’s influence can be limited by practical constraints such as military capacity, budget pressures, and competing diplomatic interests. Domestic politics also affects foreign policy: governments must consider public opinion, Parliament, and legal limits when making international decisions.

Brexit is a clear example of how change in one area reshapes influence in others. Leaving the EU gave the UK more direct control over its laws and borders, but it reduced UK access to some decision‑making forums where policies affecting Europe are set. This trade‑off feeds into broader debates about whether the UK is better off making independent choices or working closely within supranational institutions to shape outcomes from the inside.

There is also an ongoing debate about soft power versus hard power. Soft power—culture, education, diplomacy and international aid—can be very effective in building long‑term influence. Hard power—military and economic coercion—can achieve immediate results but risks backlash and long‑term costs. The balance between these forms of power is a central theme of modern British foreign policy.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about the UK’s relations with the EU and international bodies you should make sure your answers do three things: define the key idea in clear terms, apply knowledge to the context in the question, and evaluate or reach a reasoned judgement where required. For shorter knowledge questions aim to give a concise definition or description and include a brief example. For application questions (AO2), link your facts to the scenario: if a question asks about the effect of Brexit on trade, explain how leaving the single market causes customs checks and give an example of an impacted group such as small exporters. For evaluation questions (AO3), organise your answer into paragraphs that consider different viewpoints. Explain the strengths of an argument, then consider the limitations, and conclude with a balanced judgement that answers the question directly.

Start by planning a quick structure: identify the issue, choose one or two clear points to develop, and pick a relevant example (for instance the Trade and Cooperation Agreement for trade questions, the European Convention on Human Rights when discussing the Council of Europe, or the UK’s role on the UN Security Council for questions about international action). Use terms from the specification—such as sovereignty, international law, sanctions, humanitarian aid and collective defence—so your knowledge is precise. For 6‑mark and 12‑mark responses include both explanation and a judgement; for 15‑mark or higher extended responses make sure you evaluate at least two sides and reach a substantiated conclusion. Finally, check your spelling and clarity, and make sure every paragraph links back to the question so your answer stays focused and convincing.
