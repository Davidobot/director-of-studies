# Britain 1625–1701: conflict, revolution & settlement (A-level History Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction and chronological framework
The period 1625–1701 is one of the most dramatic in early modern British history. It spans the disastrous final years of Charles I’s reign, the three-way experiment of king, commonwealth and protectorate, the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, the crises of the 1670s and 1680s, and the overthrow and settlement that followed 1688–89. Students should learn to read this era as a sequence of intertwined political, religious, social and economic developments in which struggles over authority and legitimacy repeatedly re-shaped the relationship between crown and parliament. While the timeline runs from Charles I’s accession to the eve of the eighteenth century, the better answers will always pay attention to continuities as well as change, and will situate episodes such as the English Civil Wars, the Interregnum, and the Glorious Revolution in long-term processes that include state formation, religious pluralisation and overseas expansion.

## The quest for political stability, 1625–88
The central political narrative is the search for stable government. The early period is dominated by the failure of monarchical rule: Charles I’s conflicts with parliament over finance, religion and prerogative culminated in open war (1642–46), regicide (1649) and the abolition of the monarchy. The subsequent republic and Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell exposed the difficulties of non-monarchical government as different interests and military force struggled to secure political order. The Restoration of 1660 brought back the monarchy and a quick settlement intended to reconcile royal and parliamentary interests, but tensions remained. Charles II’s reign featured recurrent frictions over money, religion and foreign policy, and James II’s open Catholicism and assertion of royal prerogative provoked the crisis that led to his removal in 1688. The settlement of 1689–91 placed important limits on royal power and redefined the constitution in practice: regular parliaments, legal restrictions on arbitrary rule, and a stronger role for the political nation. Yet students should remember that political stability was never total; faction, patronage and local power structures remained decisive, and the Crown retained substantial influence in government and foreign policy.

## Religion: conflict, conformity and dissent
Religion is the other main axis of conflict. Under Charles I the push for religious uniformity, exemplified by Archbishop Laud’s policies, alienated many Puritans and fuelled fears of popery. The Civil Wars opened the front for radical religious experimentation: Presbyterians, Independents, sectaries and Levellers all vied for influence, and the period 1649–60 saw a diversity of worship. The Restoration attempted to restore the Church of England’s position; the Clarendon Code and subsequent legislation reasserted Anglican supremacy, but they also hardened dissent and created a substantial body of nonconformists. Anti-Catholic feeling surged after events such as the Popish Plot and Exclusion Crisis, culminating in an intense crisis under James II when his attempts at toleration for Catholics collided with widespread suspicion of a Catholic monarchy. The Glorious Revolution answered that crisis by settling the monarchy on Protestant foundations and producing key legislative measures, notably the Bill of Rights and the Toleration Act of 1689, which permitted dissenters a measure of legal toleration while preserving Anglican establishment. Nonetheless, the settlement left Catholics largely excluded from political life and did not bring equality for all Protestants; the Church of England retained its privileged position.

## Social and intellectual challenge, 1625–88
Beneath the political and religious turmoil there were important social and intellectual shifts. Population growth, urbanisation and the growth of trade transformed social structures. The gentry and commercial classes rose in influence, while the composition of the political nation slowly changed as officeholders and local elites adapted to new financial and administrative requirements. Intellectual life reflected and influenced politics: radical political ideas circulated in the 1640s (Levellers, Diggers) and were later succeeded by more systematic theories of sovereignty and government. Thomas Hobbes and John Locke offer useful focal points for students: Hobbes’s stress on order and monarchy contrasts with Locke’s later emphasis on contractual government and natural rights, the latter proving especially influential after 1689. The scientific revolution and the founding of the Royal Society in 1660 also indicate a broader intellectual ferment in which empirical methods and sceptical inquiry grew in prestige, contributing to a climate in which conventional religious and political certainties could be questioned.

## Economy, trade and empire, 1625–88
Economic and commercial change is an essential context for the century’s politics. Agricultural improvement and changes in land use altered rural life and supported population growth. The cloth trade, shipping and the growth of London as a commercial centre fuelled wealth and the emergence of a professional and merchant class increasingly influential in national affairs. Overseas expansion and the beginnings of profitable colonial enterprises — notably in North America and the Caribbean — provided new sources of income and strategic interest. The Navigation Acts and early mercantilist policies reflected an emerging national commercial strategy and intensified rivalry with the Dutch; naval and commercial competition shaped foreign policy and domestic debates. The East India Company and developments in the Atlantic economy, including the triangular trade, were already planting the seeds of a global British presence that would matter for politics and finance. Finally, the financial demands of late Stuart warfare and government led to important institutional innovations that some historians call the beginnings of a financial revolution: public credit, more regular taxation, and later institutions such as the Bank of England (founded in 1694) would have a profound long-term effect on state finances and parliamentary control over money.

## How revolutionary was the Glorious Revolution?
One of the key interpretative questions for this option is how far the events of 1688–89 should be regarded as a revolution. The traditional Whig interpretation presents 1688 as a fundamental constitutional revolution that established parliamentary supremacy, secured a Protestant monarchy and laid the groundwork for modern constitutional government and the financial revolution. On this view the Bill of Rights, the Toleration Act and subsequent parliamentary reforms mark a decisive break with the divine-right monarchy of the Stuarts. Critics, however, emphasise continuity: many institutional habits of monarchy persisted, the landed elite preserved much of its local power, and the settlement represented a negotiated transfer of power rather than a radical social upheaval. A middle position recognises both elements: the revolution was limited but real. It established a new constitutional balance and altered the language of legitimacy, yet left social hierarchies intact and operated primarily within elite politics. For students, the most convincing answers will weigh evidence across political, religious, economic and cultural domains, showing whether the changes of 1688–89 represented a decisive turning point or a reconfiguration of existing trends.

## Exam technique
In examinations you will face three sorts of task: essays testing knowledge and argument (AO1), source-based analysis (AO2 in Paper 2/3), and interpretation evaluation (AO3 in Paper 1 and coursework). For AO1 essays, begin with a brief direct answer to the question that outlines your argument and signposts the factors you will discuss. Use thematic paragraphs that each open with a clear topic sentence, analyse evidence (events, legislation, personalities), and link back to the question. Avoid narrative that merely recounts events; every paragraph must advance your argument. For timing, in a 45–50 minute essay aim for a concise introduction (5–7 minutes), three strong analytical paragraphs (10–12 minutes each), and a summing conclusion (5 minutes). For source-based questions, always place the source in context: say what it is, who produced it, and why it might have been written, then analyse content, tone and provenance. Discuss usefulness or limitations with reference to corroboration from your wider knowledge. For interpretation questions (AO3), compare the interpretations directly, identify the points of agreement and divergence, explain why the historians differ (focus, evidence, political or intellectual framework), and evaluate strength by testing interpretations against the wider historical record. Make use of historiographical vocabulary—terms such as revisionist, Whig, conservative or structural explanations—only when you can define and apply them.

Always plan before you write: a five-minute plan avoids waffle and ensures your response is balanced. Use specific examples — names, dates, acts, battles and legislation — to anchor claims. Where appropriate, demonstrate awareness of causation and consequence, and show sophistication by weighing relative importance and showing links between short-term triggers and long-term structures. In conclusion, synthesise your analysis; a strong concluding paragraph does more than summarise, it explains how the evidence supports your judgement and acknowledges any limitations. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions, annotate model answers to see what high-grade responses do, and revise common exemplars (for example Charles I’s Personal Rule, the execution of Charles I, Cromwell’s Protectorate, the Restoration settlement, the Exclusion Crisis, and the terms of the Glorious Revolution) so that you can deploy them fluently in exam answers.
