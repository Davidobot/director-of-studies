# Britain 1785–1870: democracy, protest & reform (A-level History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: a transformative era
The period c.1785–c.1870 in Britain covers a time of intense and overlapping change: the spread of industrial production, the reconfiguration of political representation, the rise of organised protest and the attempt by the state to manage mass poverty and social disorder. These decades see Britain move from an old order dominated by landed interests and limited urban manufacturing elites to a more complex society with industrial towns, expanding middle classes and an increasingly politicised working class. Reform was rarely the product of a single cause or moment; it was the result of long-term economic shifts, sudden crises, cultural campaigns and political recalculation. To succeed in this topic you should be able to connect economic change to political pressures, appreciate the variety of protest (from petitions to machine-breaking), and understand why some reforms succeeded while others were delayed.

## The growth of parliamentary democracy, c1785–1870
Parliamentary reform was the central political contest of the period. In the late eighteenth century the unreformed parliament contained so-called rotten and pocket boroughs, while the rapidly expanding industrial towns were under-represented. Pressure for reform built slowly and episodically: intellectual and political arguments, the impact of French revolutionary turmoil, and growing urban mobilisation all contributed. The Great Reform Act of 1832 was a partial but important victory: it eliminated many rotten boroughs, redistributed seats towards industrial areas and extended the franchise to men of property in towns, enfranchising a new urban middle class. However, 1832 left most working-class men without the vote, and the chartist movement of the late 1830s and 1840s—demanding universal male suffrage, secret ballots, annual parliaments and other measures—showed both the appetite for deeper reform and the limits of elite willingness to concede it. Later mid-century debates, the emergence of organised pressure groups such as the Reform League and changing party strategies culminated in the Second Reform Act of 1867. That Act extended the vote to many urban working men and illustrated the piecemeal, negotiated nature of British democratization: reform in this era was rarely revolutionary but cumulatively profound.

## Industrialisation, regions and social impact
Industrialisation reshaped the geography and social texture of Britain. New industries—especially cotton in the north-west, iron and coal in the Midlands and North—created rapidly growing towns like Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham. These towns presented new challenges: overcrowded housing, public health crises, and new forms of labour discipline within factories and mines. The factory system changed the rhythms of work and family life, concentrating labour in time- and place-bound factories where adults, women and children worked long hours. Economic growth produced wealth and political influence for new industrialists but also produced endemic insecurity for many workers. Regional variations mattered: while Lancashire's cotton towns developed factory-based communities, other regions retained craft and small-scale production for longer. Understanding these regional and occupational differences helps explain the diversity of protest and the varying pace of reforms.

## Protest, combinations and the rise of trade unions
Resistance to the new industrial order took many forms. Early industrial protest in the first decades of the nineteenth century included Luddism and machine-breaking, reflecting artisans’ fears that mechanisation would destroy livelihoods. Rural unrest such as the Swing Riots combined food shortages, agricultural change and anti-enclosure sentiment. Political agitation for reform ranged from middle-class petitioning to mass movements: the moral suasion and parliamentary campaigns of the early reformers contrasted with more vociferous popular pressure later. The legal framework for worker organisation shifted: the Combination Acts (1799–1800) had outlawed trade unions, but by the 1820s and 1830s pressure, covert and overt, pushed towards repeal and toleration. The Tolpuddle Martyrs episode (1834) showed the harsh reaction of authorities to early collective action, but by the mid-century the rise of “new model” trade unions—more structured, with skilled membership and advocacy for collective bargaining—made organised labour a durable force. By the 1860s and 1870s, national union platforms and political alliances increased the ability of labour to influence policy, even if the franchise remained limited.

## Poverty, pauperism and the Poor Law
The social question—what to do about mass poverty—was central to nineteenth-century politics. Before reform, relief was primarily parish-based with a mix of outdoor relief and workhouse provision. Growing concern about cost, perceived dependency and social order led to the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, which aimed to reduce poor relief expenditure and deter reliance on charity by promoting the workhouse system and the principle of “less eligibility” (i.e. conditions in workhouses should be worse than the lowest paid labour). The 1834 Act provoked strong opposition, particularly in the industrial north and in agricultural districts where the workhouse test was seen as brutal and unjust. Scandals such as Andover in the late 1840s exposed abuses and provoked demands for reform, while intellectual challenges from figures like Charles Dickens and the evidence of investigators like Seebohm Rowntree highlighted the complexity of urban poverty. The interaction between state policy, philanthropic initiatives and self-help organisations (friendly societies, cooperatives) illustrates how responses to poverty combined coercion, charity and, gradually, state provision culminating in later welfare developments.

## Key debates: why was the slave trade abolished c1785–1807?
The abolition of the British transatlantic slave trade in 1807 is a central interpretative question for this period and a good example of how historians weigh multiple causes. One strand emphasizes humanitarian and evangelical campaigns: the sustained moral activism led by figures such as William Wilberforce, backed by testimonies from former enslaved people like Olaudah Equiano, produced powerful public opinion against the trade. Another argument stresses economic change: some historians argue the industrial revolution and changing economic interests made the plantation system less central, or that the cost-benefit calculus of the Atlantic economy had altered. Political factors also mattered: the fear of slave rebellions, especially after the Haitian Revolution, and the changing electoral landscape influenced MPs. International and naval power considerations played a role, as the Royal Navy’s dominance made enforcing abolition more feasible and Britain able to present itself as morally and politically leading on the international stage. Finally, the role of key individuals and networks—abolitionist societies, parliamentary allies, and grassroots petitioning—was decisive in converting moral pressure into parliamentary success. Most historians now see abolition as the result of a complex of humanitarian campaigning, political opportunity, shifting economic interests and geopolitical calculation.

## Interpreting continuity and change
When preparing for essays on this topic, it is important to balance long-term continuities with identifiable turning points. The early nineteenth century did not witness a single decisive break from the old order; instead the era is best understood as a sequence of partial reforms, activist campaigns and institutional adjustments. For instance, the 1832 Reform Act changed parliamentary structures but not the franchise for most working people. Similarly, factory reform began with limited legislation (e.g. 1833 Factory Act) and developed through subsequent acts and enforcement changes rather than through immediate transformation. Teaching this topic well requires linking economic causes to political outcomes, assessing the relative weight of different pressures, and acknowledging regional and social diversity in experience.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on Britain c1785–c1870 successfully depends on three interlocking skills: accurate knowledge, clear argument, and critical evaluation. Begin essays with a focused introduction that sets out the argument and situates it chronologically. For AO1-style essays (Sections A and B in Paper 1) structure your response around a clear line of reasoning: present the claim, support it with precise evidence (dates, laws, personalities, case studies such as the Peterloo Massacre 1819 or the Tolpuddle Martyrs 1834), explain how the evidence supports the claim, and address counter-arguments. Use paragraphs that each have a topic sentence and link back to the central thesis. For the Section C interpretations question practise analysing short extracts: identify the historian’s argument, the emphasis or omission, the likely provenance and the perspective that might explain the interpretation. When you evaluate interpretations (AO3) consider criteria such as use of evidence, contextual knowledge, methodology, and political or ideological perspective. Ask why an historian might have written in a particular way and whether later research or different types of evidence challenge their view. Time management is crucial: plan each answer, allocate time per question, and leave a few minutes to revise conclusions. In essays always aim to reach a judgement that weighs competing explanations rather than simply listing factors. Finally, use precise terminology—causation, continuity, significance, representation—and practice linking micro-level examples to macro-level arguments so that your essays combine detail with analytical depth.
