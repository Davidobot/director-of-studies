# Anglo‑Saxon to Anglo‑Norman England (c1053–1106) (A-level History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview and significance
The years c1053–1106 cover one of the most transformative decades in English history: the fall of late Anglo‑Saxon rule, the Norman Conquest of 1066 and the consolidation of Norman authority in England and Normandy through to Henry I’s victory at Tinchebray in 1106. This was a period in which monarchy, landholding, government, law and the Church were reworked. For A‑level study the period is best understood as a sequence of linked changes: the crisis of succession in a powerful late Anglo‑Saxon kingdom; a violent and decisive military takeover in 1066; the extension of Norman control across the kingdom; and long‑term institutional adjustments that shaped medieval English government and society. These developments are central to questions of continuity and change: some Anglo‑Saxon structures—shires, sheriffs, the witanary tradition of advice to the king—survived and adapted, while the ruling elite, patterns of land tenure, military organisation and relations with Normandy were dramatically altered.

## Late Anglo‑Saxon England, c1053–66
By the mid‑eleventh century England was a relatively prosperous and well‑governed realm. Royal government relied on a network of earls, the office of the sheriff, royal landholdings and a functioning shire system. The Godwin family dominated politics from the 1030s: Earl Godwin of Wessex and his sons, especially Harold, exercised enormous local and national influence. Edward the Confessor’s reign (1042–66) exposed tensions between royal prerogative, aristocratic power and ecclesiastical influence; the court was a focus of competing factions. Economic life included an established coinage centred on the silver penny, coastal trading towns, taxation systems such as the geld, and a mixed rural economy with a range of tenures. The succession crisis on Edward’s death combined competing claims to the throne (Harold Godwinson, William of Normandy, and Harald Hardrada of Norway) with the political realities of the witan and factional rivalries. The invasions of 1066—Harald Hardrada’s landing in the north and William’s invasion from the south—exposed both the vulnerabilities and resilience of the Anglo‑Saxon polity and culminated in the decisive clash at Hastings.

## The Norman conquest and extension of control, 1066–93
William of Normandy’s victory at Hastings in 1066 was not simply a battlefield coup but the opening move of a wider military and administrative programme to transform England. William combined military skill and claim‑making with political calculation: securing a papal backing, assembling a trained force and exploiting weaknesses in English defensive coordination. After Hastings he moved quickly to secure submission in the south and to push into the Midlands and north. Resistance did not end with 1066. The years 1067–70 saw local uprisings, foreign interventions and the famous Harrying of the North (1069–70), a campaign of scorched earth designed to eliminate opposition in Yorkshire and the north‑west. The Norman response combined punitive devastation with long‑term strategies of control: the creation of a military state based on castle building, the redistribution of land to Norman followers (tenants‑in‑chief), and the imposition of a new ruling elite that owed service and military obligation to the king. Castles—motte‑and‑bailey and later stone keeps—were a key instrument: highly visible, militarily effective and administrative centres for controlling localities.

The consolidation of Norman power also involved handling Wales and Scotland. William established marcher control along the Welsh borders while northern politics involved intermittent conflict with Malcolm III of Scotland. Rebellions continued, including the East Anglian uprisings and the revolt of 1075, demonstrating that Norman authority was contested and required constant reinforcement.

## The founding of a military state: land, castles and social change
Norman rule in England reorganised landholding around the feudal bond between lord and vassal. The king became the principal landowner, distributing large estates to his principal followers as tenants‑in‑chief in return for military service. This reallocation had immediate social consequences: many leading English landholders were dispossessed or diminished, although the process was uneven and some Anglo‑Saxon families retained local influence. The Domesday Survey of 1086 provides striking evidence of land transfers and the composition of landholding; it is indispensable for understanding the extent of change and the persistence of local continuities in agriculture and settlement.

Military obligation and the castle network transformed local power relations. Castles served as bases from which Norman lords could assert authority, collect revenue and administer justice. The construction of castles and the practice of retaining followers—livery and maintenance—helped to create a new aristocratic class whose status derived from service and royal favour, rather than wholly from older kinship networks. This period also saw important social shifts in towns and trade: some coastal and river ports expanded as trade links with Normandy and the Continent developed, while village life adapted to new patterns of manor‑based lordship. The gradual decline of slavery and the changing status of peasants under imposed manorial systems were long‑term social trends in this era.

## State, church and society, 1066–1106
Norman governance combined centralising reforms with pragmatic use of existing institutions. The king’s household and the evolving chancery developed into instruments of royal administration, issuing writs and managing finances. The office of sheriff was retained and extended, increasingly responsible for royal authority at a local level and for collection of taxes such as the geld. The silver penny and royal mints remained central to fiscal policy; royal revenues were augmented by exploitation of feudal incidents and profits of justice. The Domesday Book itself was an administrative tool to assess the wealth of the kingdom for taxation and control.

The church underwent parallel transformation. The deposition of Stigand and the appointment of Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury signalled a program of reform and reorganisation. Lanfranc’s reforms professionalised the episcopate, reorganised diocesan structures and aligned the English church more closely with papal reform movements. Anselm’s later disputes with William II over investiture and clerical rights foreshadowed a longer conflict between royal and papal authority, resolved only partially in Henry I’s reign. The relationship between king and church was complex: Norman rulers sought legitimacy through ecclesiastical endorsement but also resisted clerical independence that threatened royal prerogatives.

By the end of the period England was a polity with Norman elites dominating landholding and military power, a centralising royal administration, and a reformed church—yet many local structures and practices retained Anglo‑Saxon forms. This combination of innovation and continuity is essential to understanding why the Conquest was both revolutionary and conservative.

## Normandy, Anglo‑Norman relations and the restoration of the kingdom, 1066–1106
England and Normandy remained interdependent. William’s dual role as Duke of Normandy and King of England created a trans‑Channel polity whose rulers moved between territories and whose aristocracy held lands on both sides of the Channel. Normandy itself was not simply a secure backwater; it faced its own military pressures and rebellions, and William’s sons created dynastic tensions. The rebellion of 1088 against William Rufus, the rivalry between Robert Curthose and William Rufus, and the involvement of Anglo‑Norman nobles in continental affairs show how the two realms were connected politically and militarily.

William Rufus’s reign (1087–1100) illustrated tensions between royal priorities in England and ducal needs in Normandy. Robert Curthose’s decision to go on crusade and to maintain his own power base in Normandy further complicated Anglo‑Norman politics. Henry I’s seizure of the English throne in 1100 and his subsequent campaign in Normandy culminating in the victory at Tinchebray in 1106 reunited the Anglo‑Norman territories under one ruler and re‑established the Anglo‑Norman kingdom. Henry’s rule began to reverse some of the fragmentation of the previous decades and to build the centralised structures that would characterise the early twelfth century.

## Sources and how historians use them
Key contemporary and near‑contemporary sources for this period include the Anglo‑Saxon Chronicle, William of Poitiers, William of Jumièges, Orderic Vitalis and the Bayeux Tapestry; Domesday Book provides administrative ground‑truth. Each source has limitations: chronicles often reflect local bias or the agenda of patrons; the Bayeux Tapestry is a visual narrative shaped to glorify a particular view of events; Domesday is administrative and not narrative but is invaluable for economic and landholding evidence. Good historical practice is to combine narrative chronicles, administrative records and archaeology to triangulate evidence. When assessing change and continuity, be alert to regional variation (for example the north vs south) and to the different scales of time: short‑term violence and long‑term institutional shifts.

## Exam technique
Paper 2 (Depth study) requires two answers in 1 hour 30 minutes: a compulsory Section A task based on two sources (AO2), and a Section B essay from a choice of questions (AO1). Time management is crucial: aim to spend about 45 minutes on the source question and 40–45 minutes on the essay, leaving a few minutes to proofread each answer.

For the source (AO2) question begin with a brief introduction that locates the sources: identify the type of source, the general content and the focus of the question. Always address provenance before detailed content analysis: who produced the source, when, for what audience and purpose? Explain how provenance affects reliability and usefulness. Then analyse the content carefully: what specific claims does each source make about the issue (for example, the nature of resistance, Norman methods of control, or the role of a particular individual)? Use your contextual knowledge to test the claims, citing events, dates and relevant facts to corroborate or challenge each source. Compare the two sources directly: do they agree, diverge or complement one another? Conclude with a clear judgement on the value of the sources for the enquiry, weighing both evidence and limitations.

For the essay (AO1) start with a focused thesis that answers the question directly and outlines the argument. Structure the essay thematically or chronologically as appropriate, but ensure each paragraph advances the argument and links back to the question. Use precise factual knowledge and concrete examples—Hastings 1066, Harrying of the North 1069–70, Domesday 1086, Lanfranc’s reforms, castle building, Tinchebray 1106—to support analysis. Evaluate causation and significance rather than merely narrate events: explain why change occurred, who benefited, and how far continuity persisted. Where relevant, consider regional differences and the range of social groups affected (nobility, clergy, peasants, townsfolk). End with a balanced conclusion that weighs evidence and reaches a reasoned judgement.

Avoid common pitfalls: do not write a descriptive narrative without analytical focus; do not treat Domesday or chronicles as transparent facts without assessing bias; do not ignore provenance in source work; and do not overclaim continuity or change without supporting evidence. Practice writing succinct, evidence‑rich paragraphs and linking sentences that make your argument easy to follow. With clear organisation, precise knowledge and careful evaluation of sources and interpretations, you can demonstrate the depth of understanding required for this topic.
