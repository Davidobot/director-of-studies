# Russia 1917–1991: Lenin to Yeltsin (A-level History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: the arc from empire to post‑Soviet state
The period 1917–1991 traces one of the most dramatic political experiments of the twentieth century: the collapse of the Romanov autocracy, Bolshevik seizure of power, building of a one‑party communist state, its rise to superpower status, and its eventual disintegration into independent republics. Key themes for revision are the nature of revolution and consolidation (1917–24), the transformation under Stalin (1928–53), post‑Stalin reforms and international position (1953–85), and the failures and reforms of the last decade (1985–91). Throughout, students should link political change to economic policy, social developments and the challenge of nationalities, and weigh continuity against change. Understanding that historical interpretations differ — for example on reasons for Stalin’s terror or the causes of the USSR’s collapse — is central to the Pearson Edexcel specification and to the AO3 tasks in Paper 1.

## Revolutionary transformation, 1917–24: from dual power to one‑party state
The February 1917 revolution ended imperial rule and brought a precarious dual power arrangement: the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet. The continued commitment to war, economic collapse and social unrest created the conditions for Bolshevik success. The October revolution, led by Lenin, replaced the Provisional Government with a Bolshevik-led regime that sought to end imperial war (Brest‑Litovsk), redistribute land, and transfer power to workers’ councils. The civil war (1918–21) tested the new regime: the Red Army under Trotsky defeated the Whites and other opponents, while foreign interventions were limited and ultimately unsuccessful. War Communism — grain requisitioning, nationalisation and central control — helped sustain the Bolshevik war effort but provoked economic breakdown and peasant resistance, culminating in uprisings such as Kronstadt (1921). Lenin’s response was pragmatic: the New Economic Policy (NEP) restored limited market mechanisms, stabilised the economy and underpinned Bolshevik survival, while the party introduced one‑party rule via the ban on factions and the centralisation of power. Lenin’s death in 1924 left a power vacuum and a debate over succession that set the stage for Stalin’s rise.

## Stalinism: industrialisation, terror and the making of a superpower, 1928–53
Stalin’s rule transformed Soviet society by forcible collectivisation of agriculture and rapid industrialisation through successive Five‑Year Plans. Collectivisation aimed to increase grain procurement and free labour for heavy industry, but it provoked catastrophic disruption, resistance and famine in the countryside, most notably in Ukraine. The industrial push achieved impressive growth in heavy industry and defence capacity, but at enormous human cost. Political consolidation was enforced by the party apparatus and the secret police. The 1930s saw show trials, purges of the party, army and intelligentsia, and the expansion of the Gulag system. Historians debate motivations: some interpret the terror as a proactive strategy by Stalin to eliminate rivals and reshape society; others emphasise structural pressures and local dynamics. The Second World War (the Great Patriotic War) was decisive: initial defeats in 1941 were reversed by tenacity and mobilisation, and Soviet victory over Nazi Germany elevated the USSR to superpower status. Post‑war reconstruction and the Cold War confrontation consolidated authoritarian control and militarised priorities, leaving forthcomings for later leaders.

## The USSR in the Cold War: thaw, détente and stagnation, 1953–85
After Stalin’s death in 1953, leadership struggles gave way to Nikita Khrushchev’s leadership and the process of de‑Stalinisation. Khrushchev’s 1956 Secret Speech denounced Stalin’s cult and terror, initiating cautious liberalisation, decentralisation attempts and the controversial Virgin Lands campaign. The era brought short‑term cultural thaw and agricultural experiments, but foreign policy crises — Hungary 1956 and the Cuban Missile Crisis 1962 — exposed limits to reform. Khrushchev’s erratic policies led to his removal in 1964 and the Brezhnev era ushered in political stability and economic inertia. Brezhnev promoted détente with the West and emphasised stability; the period saw improved living standards for some, expansion of social welfare and an entrenched nomenklatura. Yet underlying economic problems — slow productivity, technological lag, and over‑concentration on military expenditure — deepened. Events such as the Prague Spring of 1968, suppressed by the Warsaw Pact, showed the USSR’s insistence on political control in its bloc. The Afghan intervention of 1979 further strained resources and international standing and marked the beginning of a costly quagmire.

## Gorbachev, perestroika and glasnost: reform and unraveling, 1985–91
Mikhail Gorbachev’s arrival in 1985 marked a genuine attempt to reform the Soviet system. Glasnost (openness) relaxed censorship, encouraged public debate and exposed past abuses; perestroika (restructuring) sought to revive the economy through limited market mechanisms, enterprise autonomy and reduced central planning. Gorbachev also pursued arms‑control talks with the West and attempted to reform the Communist Party’s monopoly. However, reforms opened up crises they could not control. Economic reform was halting and uneven; glasnost unleashed nationalist movements, ecological grievances and historical reappraisals; party authority eroded. The August 1991 coup by reactionary elements failed but fatally weakened the centre. Boris Yeltsin’s rise and the declarations of sovereignty by republics culminated in the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991. Debates remain about responsibility: Gorbachev’s failure to manage the transition, long‑term structural economic weaknesses, and the surge of republican nationalism each played roles.

## Economic, social and cultural change across the period
Economic policy oscillated between central planning and limited market reform. War Communism, NEP, Five‑Year Plans, state socialism, and perestroika represent evolving strategies to mobilise resources. Industrialisation changed the social fabric: rapid urbanisation, the growth of an industrial proletariat, educational expansion and improvements in health and literacy created a modernising society. Women’s roles changed significantly, as the Soviet state promoted female labour and formal equality, though traditional social roles persisted. Cultural policy alternated between avant‑garde experimentation in the 1920s, Socialist Realism as official policy under Stalin, and periodic cultural thaws. The state provided broad social security, housing programmes and universal education, forming a social contract that linked stability to regime legitimacy until economic strains and political repression eroded consent. Throughout, the Party’s control over appointments (nomenklatura), media and education shaped social mobility and identity.

## Nationalities, dissent and the security apparatus
The USSR was a multi‑national state of republics and many ethnicities, with a long history of tension over language, religion and autonomy. Central policies oscillated between Russification, korenizatsiia (indigenisation) in the 1920s, and repression. Dissident movements — from samizdat writers and human rights activists to organised campaigns in the Baltic states and Ukraine — tested limits of control. The KGB and local security organs monitored dissent, but glasnost weakened their grip. Nationalist sentiments, amplified by economic grievances and historical memory, were crucial in the USSR’s collapse. Internationally, Soviet control over Eastern Europe destabilised in 1989 when satellite states abandoned communism, reducing Moscow’s leverage and accelerating internal pressures.

## Interpretations and historiographical debates
Students should be familiar with major interpretative debates they are likely to encounter in essays and the Section C interpretation question. Historians disagree about causes and character: Was the Bolshevik takeover inevitable given 1917 conditions, or contingent on mistakes by the Provisional Government? Was Stalinism an outgrowth of Leninist centralism or a personal dictatorship shaped by contingency and terror? On the USSR’s collapse, structuralists emphasise long‑term economic inefficiency and systemic contradictions of command economy, while agency‑centred accounts highlight Gorbachev’s policies and political miscalculations; nationalist interpretations stress the decisive role of republican assertiveness and identity politics. For teaching, use primary examples — a quotation from the Secret Speech, statistical data on industrial growth, or contemporaneous accounts of the August 1991 coup — to illustrate and weigh each perspective, and encourage students to evaluate historians’ motives and evidence when answering AO3 questions.

## Exam technique
Begin every essay with a clear thesis that directly answers the question and maps your argument. For AO1 essays, structure your response chronologically or thematically as appropriate, but always maintain a line of argument and use named examples and dates to support points: for instance, cite Brest‑Litovsk, Kronstadt, the Five‑Year Plans, the Great Purge, the Secret Speech, and the August 1991 coup where relevant. For source and AO2 questions, consider provenance, purpose, tone and content; practise unpacking how a source’s origin (an official speech, a dissident memoir or a KGB report) shapes what it can and cannot tell you. For AO3 interpretation questions, place extracts in context, identify the historian’s argument, compare with at least one alternative interpretation, and explain why differences exist (ideology, evidence, chronology, or access to archives). Use short, evaluative historiographical labels — for example, “structuralist” versus “agency”— but always justify those labels with specifics. Time management is vital: for a two‑hour 15‑minute paper, plan roughly how long you will spend on each question and leave the last 10 minutes to edit. In all answers, balance knowledge with analysis: avoid narrative that simply lists events without explaining their significance. Finally, practise past papers under timed conditions and get feedback that focuses on argument clarity, use of evidence and engagement with interpretations — this will convert knowledge into exam success.
