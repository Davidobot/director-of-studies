# Tudor England: authority, nation & religion (1509–1603) (A-level History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: a transformative century
The Tudor period, from Henry VIII’s accession in 1509 to Elizabeth I’s death in 1603, is one of the most dramatic and consequential centuries in English history. It is characterised by the centralisation of royal power, the break with Rome and the religious upheavals that followed, the creation of new political institutions and ideas about sovereignty, and profound social, economic and cultural change. For A‑level study this option asks you to understand long‑term developments across the period as well as to engage with historians’ interpretations. You will need to combine secure factual knowledge with an ability to explain change and continuity, cause and consequence, and to assess competing explanations—for example, why the English Reformation happened, how effectively Tudor monarchs controlled the realm, and whether Elizabeth’s final years constituted a crisis of government.

## Monarchy and government: personalities and institutions
Tudor government rested on the person of the monarch, but the nature of kingship and the machinery of state evolved significantly. Henry VIII’s reign showed how royal will could reshape institutions: the use of parliament to legalise the break with Rome, the expansion of royal revenue through the dissolution of the monasteries, and the rise of powerful ministers such as Wolsey and Cromwell who combined household, administrative and legal power. Under Edward VI the crown’s Protestant policy was driven by a regency, revealing the vulnerability of minority rule. Mary I’s short restoration of Catholicism demonstrated limits to royal control when religious change lacked popular support and when foreign policy (her marriage to Philip of Spain) alienated domestic opinion. Elizabeth I’s long reign established the model of a prudent, politically astute monarch who balanced crown, court, council and parliament. The role of councillors, the development of the privy council and the increasing importance of the justices of the peace at local level show how Tudor government depended on networks of patronage as well as formal offices. Understanding the balance between personal monarchy and developing administrative state is central to this component.

## Religious change: rupture, settlement and survival
Religion is the twin focus of this route. Henry’s break with Rome in the 1530s was rooted in dynastic and personal concerns but it produced a constitutional and ecclesiastical revolution. The dissolution of the monasteries removed an important social and economic institution and redistributed wealth and land, accelerating social change. Under Edward VI the country moved decisively towards Protestant worship and doctrine; under Mary I a counter‑reformation sought to restore papal authority and bring back Catholic clergy and ritual. Elizabeth’s settlement attempted a via media: the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity, the new Prayer Book and a deliberately ambiguous theological position designed to secure public conformity. Yet the settlement did not mean uniform belief. Catholic recusancy persisted in pockets; the emergence of Puritan ideas challenged the limits of the settlement from within; and the arrival of Jesuit missionaries and papal plots in the 1570s and 1580s turned religion into a security issue. You must be able to explain the policies, their aims and their failures, and to weigh evidence on how extensive popular attachment to Catholic or Protestant identities really was across regions and social groups.

## State control, resistance and rebellion
The Tudors faced numerous challenges to order, some local and social, some dynastic and conspiratorial. Rebellions such as the 1536 Pilgrimage of Grace demonstrate how religious change and socio‑economic grievances could combine to threaten royal authority in the regions. During Elizabeth’s reign the Northern Earls’ rebellion of 1569 and later plots—Ridolfi, Throckmorton, Babington—reveal the continuing link between Catholic resistance at home and foreign power politics. At the local level, unrest over taxation, enclosure and poor relief could explode into disorder, while the crown’s response developed from military force to legal and administrative remedies: stronger regional councils, the use of the justices of the peace, and a tightening of surveillance and legislation against recusants. The Irish wars late in Elizabeth’s reign, and the costly campaigns and rebellions they produced, show the limits of Tudor power overseas and the expense of enforcing conformity and control beyond England. You should trace how the crown’s methods of control changed and why some rebellions succeeded in generating real threats while others were contained.

## Economic, social and cultural change
Tudor England saw important economic shifts that affected social structures and culture. The cloth trade remained central but was transformed by new draperies and the international migration of skilled workers. Population growth and inflation put pressure on the rural poor and encouraged enclosure, changes in land use and migration to towns. The dissolution of the monasteries removed traditional local welfare providers and contributed to the development of new systems of poor relief, culminating later in Elizabethan poor laws. Cultural life was reshaped by the Reformation, the growth of literacy and the printing press, and by courtly patronage. Drama, music and the poetry of the age—Shakespeare, Marlowe, the courtly imagery around Elizabeth—reflect and reinforce social and political values. Exploration and early commercial ventures brought new goods and ideas, and increased London’s importance as a commercial and cultural centre. When answering essays, show the connections between economic forces, social tensions and political responses, and avoid treating these spheres as isolated.

## Historical interpretations: was there a crisis in Elizabeth’s last years?
A central historiographical question tied to this option is whether Elizabeth’s final years (1589–1603) represent a general crisis of government. Historians who argue that there was a crisis point to several strands of evidence: the threat from Spain culminating in the Armada and the ongoing war with Spain and the rebellion in Ireland, harvest failures and social distress in the 1590s, factionalism at court over the succession, and the 1601 Parliament which revealed tensions between crown and Commons over monopolies and finance. These elements, taken together, suggest a government stretched to breaking point. Opposing interpretations emphasise Elizabeth’s survival strategies and the resilience of her political system: the continuing operation of the privy council, effective fiscal adaptations (including newer forms of revenue raising), the failure of court faction to cohere into a successful plot, and the disciplined management of succession issues until her death. A useful approach when tackling the AO3 question is to map the evidence for crisis and counter‑evidence, to consider the scale and geography of problems (local famine versus general breakdown), to evaluate the role of contingency (bad harvests, deaths), and to assess whether short‑term pressures mean systemic failure. Be prepared to judge how persuasive each factor is and whether the combination genuinely amounts to a crisis or merely the strains of a long and costly reign.

## Sources and historiography: reading the past critically
For Paper 1 Section C you will be given interpretations (short extracts) to analyse and evaluate. The skills tested are: placing an interpretation in context; understanding the historian’s argument; assessing the evidence and perspective used; identifying omissions and emphases; and comparing interpretations. When you read an extract ask: what is the historian’s key claim, what evidence would support it, what might they be downplaying, and how does this view relate to other historians’ accounts? Consider the date of the interpretation—interpretations written in the nineteenth, mid‑twentieth or late‑twentieth centuries are often shaped by different priorities (nationalism, domestic politics, ideological context). Use your knowledge of the period to test an interpretation’s plausibility and to offer alternative readings. Good answers balance close analysis of each extract with clear knowledge of the period and an overall judgement about which interpretation is the most convincing, explaining why.

## Exam technique
Answering the three-question Paper 1 exam requires a clear strategy. For the AO1 essays in Sections A and B plan briefly before you write: identify the approach the question requires—causation, change and continuity, significance, or comparison—then choose two or three well‑developed points with specific evidence and end with a concise judgement. Time management matters: allocate time so you can plan, write and proofread. For the AO3 interpretation question in Section C begin by summarising each extract’s argument in one sentence, then analyse the methods and evidence used, consider the historian’s perspective and possible reasons for that stance, and finally compare the interpretations and make a reasoned judgement that refers to wider knowledge. Use provenance—date, genre, intended audience—only where it helps explain emphasis and bias. Always link your comments back to the extracts; do not digress into a general essay. Practice with past interpretation extracts under timed conditions, and develop the habit of structuring paragraphs: topic sentence, evidence and analysis, link to the question. Clear, factual knowledge, precise terminology, and a steady focus on answering the question are what lift answers into the higher levels.
