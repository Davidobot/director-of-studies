# USA 1917–1996: In search of the American Dream (A-level History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview and themes
The period 1917–1996 is presented in this specification as a long sweep in which the promise and contradictions of the “American Dream” are repeatedly tested. From the United States’ entry into the First World War through the social, political and economic convulsions of the twentieth century, the nation alternated between periods of confident expansion and moments of intense retrenchment. Key themes for study are political leadership and institutional change; the relationship between economic growth, inequality and state intervention; struggles for civil rights and the extension of citizenship; cultural and social transformations that reshaped identity and values; and the international role of the United States as a global power. To understand the period you will need to combine factual knowledge of major events with an awareness of long-term continuities and changing interpretations about what the American Dream meant in different decades.

## Political change and presidential leadership
Politically, the United States moved from relative isolation at the start of the period to international leadership after 1945 and then into contested retrenchment by the 1980s and 1990s. The wartime presidency of Woodrow Wilson, with his Fourteen Points, set a pattern of charismatic presidential leadership that continued through Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal and leadership in the Second World War. Roosevelt’s New Deal (1933–39) transformed the relationship between state and citizen through social security, public works and regulatory agencies, establishing the expectation that the federal government would act to stabilise the economy and protect citizens in times of crisis. The Cold War shaped the presidencies of Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, with domestic policy often subordinated to anti-communist priorities, most dramatically during McCarthyism in the early 1950s. The Vietnam War exposed limits to presidential power and fuelled public distrust, culminating in the Watergate crisis that forced Nixon’s resignation in 1974 and produced long-lasting scepticism about government. The Reagan years (1981–89) signalled an ideological shift: smaller state rhetoric, supply-side economics and assertive anti-communism. Ronald Reagan’s popularity and policy choices have been read in different ways by historians, some seeing a decisive conservative counter-revolution while others emphasise continuities with earlier trends and the persistence of an activist state in new forms.

## Economy, labour and the changing quality of life
Economic change is central to understanding the American Dream across this period. The roaring twenties delivered consumer prosperity for many but left farmers and minorities vulnerable, and the stock market crash of 1929 ushered in the Great Depression that reshaped public expectations. The New Deal and wartime mobilisation brought recovery and full employment; the post-1945 decades saw unprecedented mass affluence, suburban growth, the GI Bill’s expansion of higher education and home ownership, and the rise of a strong middle class. Yet this prosperity was uneven: structural racial and regional disparities persisted, and the oil shocks and stagflation of the 1970s disrupted the postwar consensus. The 1980s added deregulation, tax cuts and a turn towards market solutions; they also produced rising inequality and a fiscal deficit. By the 1990s the economy moved into high-tech growth and globalisation, but debates continued over whether economic opportunity had expanded or narrowed for ordinary Americans. When you revise this period, link economic policies to social outcomes: how did the New Deal change poverty relief; who benefited from postwar suburbs; why did deindustrialisation hit particular regions and communities hardest?

## Civil rights, social movements and changing identities
The long struggle for civil rights shows both the power and the limits of law and protest. Black Americans pressed for full citizenship through legal challenges, organised protests and community activism. Landmark Supreme Court rulings such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954) provided legal foundations for desegregation, and mass direct action—Montgomery 1955, the March on Washington 1963, Selma 1965—produced transformative legislation in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Yet historians emphasise that legislation did not automatically end structural discrimination; the shift from legal gains to social equality was contested and incomplete. The period also saw diversification of protest: the rise of Black Power, Native American activism, Chicano and Hispanic movements, feminist campaigns that culminated in the women’s liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and the beginnings of organised gay rights activism. These movements broadened the meaning of the American Dream, arguing that it must encompass not only economic security but social dignity and equal citizenship. When considering these developments, pay attention to continuities as well as ruptures: long-term grassroots organising, wartime migrations, and the interplay between local struggle and federal legislation.

## Culture, media and social change
Culture and mass media played a formative role in shaping hopes and anxieties about the American Dream. The Jazz Age and Hollywood in the 1920s helped create a mass culture; radio and later television became central forums for politics, entertainment and social instruction. The postwar era relied on the image of suburban domesticity as an ideal, simultaneously producing anxieties that were expressed through literature, film and music. The counterculture of the 1960s used music, film and alternative media to challenge conformity, while television coverage of the Vietnam War and civil rights protests brought events into living rooms and helped mobilise opinion. Immigration policy shifted in 1965 with the Hart-Celler Act, which altered the ethnic composition of the nation and reshaped urban and cultural life. Cultural history is vital for this option because it reveals how ordinary Americans perceived opportunity and belonging; when you revise, integrate cultural evidence—films, songs, television, advertisements—into political and social narratives to show how the Dream was imagined and contested.

## Foreign policy, the Cold War and global leadership
The United States’ international role is inseparable from domestic debates about identity and purpose. Entry into the First World War, leadership in World War Two, and the post-1945 Cold War consensus established the United States as a global superpower. Containment against the Soviet Union guided interventions and alliances from Korea to Vietnam and shaped domestic priorities from civil defence to spending on science and education. Historians debate the causes of the Cold War and the extent to which American foreign policy both defended and exported American values. The late 1970s and 1980s saw détente, renewed confrontation and an arms build-up; the later Reagan administration pursued a mix of military pressure and diplomacy that contributed to the end of the Cold War. Interpreting these global developments in relation to domestic transformations is crucial: defence spending reshaped industry, anti-communist rhetoric affected civil liberties, and foreign crises could accelerate or blunt reform movements at home.

## Exam technique
You will face three types of assessed task in the Paper 1 examination: essay questions on themes (Sections A and B) and a compulsory interpretations question (Section C). For essay questions you must show secure factual knowledge, make analytical use of that knowledge, and deploy it to address the specific question. Start each essay with a concise introduction that sets the argument in time and defines key terms, and use the body paragraphs to develop linked analytical points, each supported by specific evidence and explanation. Avoid narrative that simply lists events; organise evidence to show causation, consequence or extent of change as required by the question. For the interpretations question you will be given two short extracts. Your task is to show how the extracts represent particular historical arguments and to weigh them against wider evidence. Begin by paraphrasing each extract to show you understand the author’s claim, then compare and contrast the two viewpoints and explain reasons for differences—context, sources, ideological perspective or intended audience. Crucially, evaluate both extracts by bringing in additional knowledge and a clear final judgement: which interpretation you find more convincing and why.

Time management is essential. In a 2 hour 15 minute paper aim to spend roughly equal time on Sections A and B for the depth of argument they require, and reserve time for the interpretations question in Section C where precision and evaluative judgment are critical. Use short plans to structure each answer before writing so that paragraphs are purposeful and arguments coherent. Where possible, integrate historiography into essays even when not explicitly required: a sentence or two that recognises competing interpretations shows awareness of AO3-style thinking and strengthens your AO1 analysis. In source questions (Paper 2 and Paper 3), focus on provenance as well as content: who produced the source, for what purpose and how that shapes reliability. Above all, answer the question set, not everything you know about the period; selective, well-illustrated and clearly argued essays will gain marks ahead of unfocused, exhaustive narrative.
