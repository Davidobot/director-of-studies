# Henry II and the Angevin Empire (1154–1189) (A-level History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: the king who rebuilt royal power
Henry II came to the throne in 1154 after two decades of civil war known as the Anarchy. He inherited a fragmented realm: a weakened royal treasury, a fractious nobility and an Anglo-Norman monarchy that had lost much of its authority. His personal position was unusual. As Count of Anjou and Maine, Duke of Normandy and, through marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine (1152), ruler of vast southern French lands, he controlled what later historians call the Angevin Empire. Henry’s reign is best understood as a sustained programme to restore and extend royal authority across England and his continental domains, to modernise government and finance, and to impose royal justice. At the same time his reign was marked by explosive tensions: between king and church, between the monarch and his ambitious sons, and between competing claims in France. These tensions shaped both his successes and his eventual decline.

## Restoration and extension of royal authority, 1154–72
On accession Henry faced immediate structural problems: powerful barons who profited from the chaos of the previous decades, illegal or private castles that challenged central control and a depleted exchequer. He moved quickly and deliberately. The early policy of destroying unauthorized castles and curbing the private power of magnates reduced the military independence of the great lords. Administrative measures such as the Cartae Baronum (a survey of baronial tenures) and the Inquest of the Sheriffs strengthened central oversight of landholding and royal officials. Henry reasserted control in the regions: he made peace in Wales and secured submission from Scottish kings, and he worked to re-establish control across his Angevin lands in France, using diplomacy and force where required. The presence of Eleanor of Aquitaine in the political mix added enormous resources and a powerful dynastic claim, but also created rival centres of influence within the royal family.

## Reforms in England: justice, finance and administration
Henry’s long-term legacy rests heavily on institutional reform. He reorganised central government around the Curia Regis (the king’s council), fitted new senior ministers into formal roles such as the justiciar and the chancellor, and extended royal administration into the localities through itinerant justices and the system of general eyres. Legal developments under Henry were crucial: the Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton strengthened royal jurisdiction and the use of royal courts, while writs such as novel disseisin and mort d’ancestor provided mechanisms for local plaintiffs to seek redress in the king’s courts. These changes did not create a uniform system overnight, but they steadily increased the reach of royal justice and made the crown the arbiter of disputes.

Financially, Henry revived old taxes and improved revenue collection. He extended royal income by restoring crown lands, reforming the coinage in 1158 (with further issues later) and making skilled use of scutage and feudal incidents to extract money from his vassals. Figures such as Richard fitzNigel were important in financial administration. The combined effect of legal reform and improved finance was to increase the king’s independence from his barons and to provide the resources needed for military campaigns and government.

## Henry II and the church: the Becket crisis
The relationship between Henry and the English church was central to his reign and to his international reputation. Henry appointed his former chancellor, Thomas Becket, as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162 hoping to secure ecclesiastical cooperation with royal policy. Instead Becket became a formidable defender of ecclesiastical privilege. The conflict climaxed with the Constitutions of Clarendon (1164), a royal attempt to define and restrict clerical immunities and to subject the church to royal law on certain matters. Becket’s refusal to accept these measures, his subsequent flight into exile and his return in 1170 set up a bitter confrontation.

Becket’s murder in Canterbury Cathedral in December 1170 was a turning point. Whether Henry intended the king’s angry words that preceded the killing is debated, but the political fallout was immediate and severe. Henry performed a public penance at Avranches in 1172 and made concessions to the papacy. The incident damaged his moral standing in Christendom and forced him to make compromises over investiture and the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts. Nonetheless, Henry’s position after 1174 showed that he could survive a major reputational crisis while continuing to pursue practical aims: maintaining authority and recovering control of his realms.

## Crises within the family: inheritance, rebellion and the Great Rebellion 1173–74
Henry’s dynastic arrangements sowed the seeds of recurrent instability. He sought to provide for his sons through shared power and titles: the premature coronation of his eldest surviving son as Henry the Young King in 1170, and the grant of duchies or counties to Richard, Geoffrey and John, were intended to secure succession but instead fuelled rivalry. The “Great Rebellion” of 1173–74 saw Henry’s sons, encouraged and supported by foreign powers (notably Louis VII of France) and alienated nobles, take up arms. Even Eleanor of Aquitaine supported her sons and was imprisoned for the duration of the revolt. Henry’s military response, however, demonstrated his resilience. Skilled campaigning in England and on the Continent, the suppression of invaders in Normandy and the capture of William the Lion of Scotland in 1174 secured a settlement that temporarily restored royal authority. The rebellion showed, though, that dynastic policy and the distribution of power among sons created a persistent vulnerability.

## The later reign: decline, external pressure and the collapse of authority, 1180–89
The 1180s brought fresh misfortunes. A series of untimely deaths and continuing fraternal rivalry destabilised the succession. The Young King died in 1183; Geoffrey died in 1186, leaving Richard and John as the principal contenders. Richard’s military ability and charisma made him a powerful figure, and Philip II of France—reinvigorated and driven to expand Capetian power—found an ally in Richard. By the late 1180s Henry’s position weakened: failures in diplomacy, growing debts, and the erosion of control in parts of his French domains combined with the open treachery of his sons to undermine him. In 1189 the alliance of Philip and Richard forced Henry into a humiliating position; he was compelled to make concessions and eventually to accept Richard’s succession. Henry died in 1189, leaving a mixed legacy: a kingdom strengthened by institutions of governance and royal justice, and an imperial network of continental holdings that others would soon alter or lose.

## The Angevin achievement and its limits
Henry II’s reign is often judged a success in institutional terms. He created structures of royal administration and justice that outlasted his reign and that provided a foundation for future English government. The expansion and consolidation of royal revenue, the promotion of itinerant justice, and the assertion of royal rights over barons were all significant. At the same time, Henry’s empire was not a centralized state; it rested on personal loyalties, vassalage and the king’s ability to move resources and men across a large and diverse realm. This made it powerful but fragile. The combination of territorial reach, legal innovation and dynastic fragility defines the Angevin epoch: an ambitious attempt to weld wide-ranging possessions into coherent rule, yet one ultimately undermined by competing interests, family dynamics and pressures from emerging powers such as the French crown.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on Henry II and the Angevin Empire, tailor your approach to the Assessment Objective being targeted.

For AO1 essays (breadth and depth): begin with a brief thesis that answers the question directly, then plan two or three developed paragraphs that each make one clear point supported by specific evidence—examples might include the Assizes of Clarendon, the Inquest of the Sheriffs, the Cartae Baronum, the invasion of Ireland (1171) or the suppression of the Great Rebellion (1173–74). Always link evidence to the argument: explain not just what happened but why it matters for your judgement. Conclude by returning to the question and weighing the relative significance of the points you have made.

For source questions (AO2) practice a structured source evaluation: identify and explain content, then analyse provenance—who produced the source, when and why—and assess how provenance affects reliability and usefulness. Consider corroboration and limitation: what other evidence supports or contradicts the source? Remember to place the source in its historical context and to use your contextual knowledge to evaluate claims precisely.

For interpretations (AO3) you will be asked to compare historians’ explanations (for example, reasons for Becket’s murder’s impact or why the Great Rebellion occurred). Don’t merely paraphrase the interpretations: analyse their arguments, consider authors’ perspectives and purposes, and relate them to the wider historical context and other evidence. To score highly you must judge which interpretation(s) you find most persuasive and explain why, using specific factual examples as support.

Timing and structure in the exam matter. For a 30-mark essay allow about 45–50 minutes: spend 5–10 minutes planning, 30–35 minutes writing and 5 minutes to check. For a 20-mark source question allocate time to read both sources carefully, draft a rapid plan and then write with clear paragraphs. For an interpretations question allocate time to outline each view, compare them and reach a supported judgement.

Use precise terminology—terms such as itinerant justice, assize, scutage, investiture, penance and overlordship are useful and show command of the period. Where appropriate, explain continuity and change and avoid anachronism. Finally, memorise a handful of well-chosen examples and short facts (dates, names, places) and practise deploying them under timed conditions; accuracy and relevance win marks, especially when used to evaluate an interpretation or support an argument.
