# Coastal Landscapes and Change (A-level Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Coastal systems and how coasts are classified
Coasts are dynamic systems where energy from wind, waves and tides interacts with inputs of sediment from rivers, cliffs, offshore banks and human activity to build distinctive landscapes. The littoral zone is usually divided into backshore, nearshore and offshore; these functional zones help you to organise descriptions of processes and landforms. Coasts can be classified in many ways. One useful distinction is between rocky coasts, where resistant geology and high-energy waves produce cliffs and other erosional features, and sandy or estuarine coasts, where low relief and abundant sediment lead to beaches, dunes, spits and salt marshes. Another useful framework is concordant versus discordant coasts: concordant coasts display long runs of the same rock type, sometimes producing Dalmatian-type coastlines of parallel islands, while discordant coasts expose alternating bands of hard and soft rock that form headlands and bays. Always link classification to process: geology, wave energy, tidal range and sediment supply together determine coastal character.

## Processes that shape the shoreline
Understanding coastal change depends on knowing how waves, tides and currents work. Waves are generated by wind; where the fetch is long and winds are strong they become high-energy and erosive. Constructive waves are lower and flatter, with strong swash that builds beaches; destructive waves are steeper, with powerful backwash that removes sediment. Key erosional processes include hydraulic action, abrasion (corrasion), attrition and solution (corrosion). Transport processes include longshore drift, driven by waves approaching the shore at an angle, and tidal currents which redistribute sediment in estuaries. Subaerial processes — weathering (freeze-thaw, salt crystallisation, chemical processes), and mass movement (rotational slumping, landslides, blockfall) — supply sediment to beaches and drive cliff recession. These processes operate at different temporal scales: storms produce rapid change, while background processes mould longer-term evolution.

## Erosional landforms: how they develop and what they tell us
Erosional features form where waves concentrate energy against resistant sections of coast. Wave-cut notches at the base of cliffs form from constant erosion; continued undercutting leads to rock collapse and creation of a wave-cut platform. Where headlands are exposed to focused wave attack, the cave–arch–stack–stump sequence can develop as joints and faults are exploited and progressively enlarged. On discordant coasts the differential erosion of hard and soft strata produces headlands and bays; on concordant coasts, long offshore structures such as tombolos or Dalmatian coastlines may develop where geology and sea level interact. Roches moutonnées, crag-and-tail features and other glacial relics can also influence present-day coastal form where ice-age legacy affects coastal topography. When you describe erosional landforms in answers, explain the processes that create them and use a specific example to show their scale and human impact.

## Depositional landforms, sediment cells and budgets
Where energy falls or sediments are abundant, depositional landforms develop. Beaches are the most familiar, with sediment size and sorting reflecting wave type and supply; spits form where longshore drift deposits sediment across a bay mouth and recurved ridges build at their ends under variable winds and waves. Barrier beaches, offshore bars and tombolos reflect more complex interactions of waves, tides and sea-level change. Estuarine coasts develop where fluvial and tidal processes interact and where sedimentation in sheltered waters creates mudflats and salt marshes. The sediment cell concept — sources, transfers and sinks within a defined stretch of coastline — is central to managing coasts; sediment budgets quantify inputs and outputs and reveal whether a cell is in deficit or surplus. Human actions such as dredging, dam-building and coastal protection can alter these budgets, often reducing sediment supply and accelerating erosion elsewhere, so management must be planned at the cell scale to avoid unintended consequences.

## Sea-level change, coastal recession and flooding risk
Sea-level change influences coasts on short and long timescales. Eustatic change (global changes in sea volume, often from ice melt or thermal expansion) and isostatic change (local vertical movements of land, for example post-glacial rebound or subsidence) together create emergent and submergent coastlines. Emergent coasts show raised beaches and fossil cliffs, while submergent coasts include rias and fjords. Contemporary sea-level rise combined with storm surges increases coastal flood risk, especially on low-lying coastlines and in small island states. Rapid coastal recession examples include the Holderness coast in eastern England, where soft boulder clay cliffs retreat quickly, threatening property and infrastructure. In developing regions, the risks are amplified: Bangladesh and low-lying atolls such as the Maldives face major displacement and livelihood threats from combined sea-level rise, storm surges and subsidence. Remember that rates of recession are not constant: they vary with storm frequency, human intervention, seasonal sediment supply and episodic events like tsunami and extreme storms.

## Managing coasts: strategies, conflicts and integrated approaches
Coastal management spans hard engineering, soft engineering and strategic policy choices. Hard engineering — sea walls, rock armour, groynes and offshore breakwaters — provides immediate protection at often high cost and can displace erosion downdrift. Soft engineering — beach nourishment, dune stabilisation, salt-marsh creation and cliff drainage — attempts to work with natural processes and can be more sustainable in the long term. The concept of shoreline management plans (SMPs) and integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) seeks to plan over management cells and across stakeholders. Shoreline policy options, formally articulated as Hold the Line, Managed Realignment (Strategic Realignment), Advance the Line and No Active Intervention, all have different costs, environmental impacts and social winners or losers. Managed realignment, which allows selected areas to flood to re-establish natural defenses like salt marshes, can offer resilience and habitat gain but implies relocation and compensation. Conflicts commonly arise between homeowners, local authorities, environmental groups and national planners; the case of Happisburgh in Norfolk illustrates how local communities, long-term retreat expectations and national funding constraints produce contested decisions. Effective management requires consideration of the sediment cell, cost–benefit analyses, environmental impact assessments and transparent engagement with the players involved.

## Fieldwork and geographical skills for studying coasts
Coastal topics provide excellent fieldwork opportunities to use both quantitative and qualitative methods. Common field techniques include beach profile surveys, pebble size and shape sampling to test longshore drift or cross-shore sorting, sediment grain-size analysis, measurement of cliff recession rates using historic maps and aerial photos, and surveys of stakeholder perceptions. Geospatial technologies such as GIS and satellite imagery are invaluable for mapping coastal change, calculating retreat rates and analysing land use. Statistical skills are important: measures of central tendency and dispersion, t-tests to compare pebble characteristics across sites, Spearman’s rank to look for relationships (for example between cliff height and recession rate), chi-squared tests for categorical data and the Gini coefficient for inequalities in coastal investment or risk. Fieldwork planning must address sampling strategy, timing (tide state, recent storms), safety and ethical issues. In the NEA or coursework, clear justification of methodology, careful recording of limitations and critical evaluation are essential to achieve high marks.

## Exam technique
Answering examination questions on coastal landscapes requires clarity, structure and evidence. Start longer answers by defining key terms and situating the place or process you will discuss. For describe/explain questions, sequence points logically: set out the process, explain the mechanics (for example how hydraulic action undercuts a cliff), and illustrate with a named example. For 12-mark and 20-mark tasks include both explanation and evaluation: after describing processes or management, consider effectiveness, consequences and contrasting viewpoints. Use the specification’s synoptic themes to add depth in higher-mark answers — identify relevant players, explain differing attitudes and actions, and discuss futures and uncertainties (for example the uncertainties in sea-level rise projections and implications for adaptation). When asked to assess or evaluate, weigh pros and cons, use cost–benefit considerations, and conclude with a balanced judgement that reflects evidence. Always attempt to include one labelled diagram where appropriate; a clear sketch of a sediment cell, a wave-cut platform, or a management cross-section can save time and score marks. Refer to real place examples to anchor arguments and, in longer responses, compare developed and developing contexts to show understanding of how governance and resources change outcomes. Finally, plan your essay briefly before writing so that each paragraph has a clear point, supporting evidence and a sentence linking it back to the question.
