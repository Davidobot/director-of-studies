# Tectonic Processes and Hazards (A-level Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: why tectonics matter
Tectonic processes — the movement of the Earth’s plates and the energy they release — shape many of the world’s most dramatic landscapes and present significant hazards to people. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and the tsunamis that sometimes follow sub‑marine earthquakes are concentrated in particular parts of the globe, but whether a hazard becomes a disaster depends as much on human factors as on physical ones. Understanding plate tectonics, the physical mechanisms that produce hazards, the ways we measure and compare events, and the human contexts that create vulnerability and resilience are central to succeeding in this topic and to applying geography to real‑world problems.

## Plate tectonics and the global distribution of hazards
The theory of plate tectonics explains the large‑scale movements of the lithosphere. The Earth’s outer shell is broken into plates that ride on the hotter, mobile asthenosphere. Processes including sea‑floor spreading at mid‑ocean ridges, slab pull and ridge push, and subduction at convergent margins drive plate motion. The distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes is closely linked to plate boundaries: divergent boundaries produce new crust and volcanic outpourings, convergent (destructive) margins produce deep earthquakes and explosive volcanism where oceanic crust is subducted, and conservative (transform) margins generate shallow, often damaging earthquakes where plates slide past one another. Intra‑plate earthquakes and hotspot volcanism are important exceptions: mantle plumes can create chains of volcanoes away from plate boundaries, and stress reactivation within plates can produce major earthquakes, as in parts of eastern USA and in the 1811–12 New Madrid events.

Maps of plate boundaries explain the broad spatial pattern of tectonic hazards, but local factors — such as the type of crust, rock structure and historical human settlement — control the precise locations of risk. For example, tectonically active coastal margins like the western Pacific combine high earthquake and tsunami risk with dense coastal populations, increasing disaster potential.

## How tectonic processes generate hazards: earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis
Earthquakes release energy stored as elastic strain in crustal rocks. Rupture produces primary (P) and secondary (S) body waves and longer period surface waves, which cause ground shaking, surface rupture and slope failure. Shallow focus earthquakes typically cause the most intense damage to buildings, while deep focus events may be felt over large areas but cause less surface destruction. Secondary effects of shaking include liquefaction where saturated, loose sediments temporarily behave like a fluid, leading to building collapse, and triggered landslides in steep terrain.

Volcanoes display a wide range of behaviours determined by magma composition, gas content and eruptive style. Basaltic magmas at constructive margins and hotspots tend to be low viscosity and produce effusive lava flows, while andesitic to rhyolitic magmas at subduction zones are gas‑rich and produce explosive eruptions, pyroclastic flows, ash clouds and volcanic gases. Secondary volcanic hazards include lahars (volcanic mudflows) and jökulhlaups (glacial outburst floods) when eruptions interact with ice or heavy rainfall.

Tsunamis are long‑wavelength waves generated by sudden displacement of the seafloor, most commonly during large subduction zone earthquakes. They travel rapidly across ocean basins and may be low in amplitude at sea but build dramatically on shallow coastlines, producing devastating inundation and damage. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami are stark demonstrations of the ocean‑scale reach of sub‑marine rupture.

## From hazard to disaster: vulnerability, resilience and the PAR model
A hazard becomes a disaster where exposure, vulnerability and lack of resilience combine to cause severe social, economic or environmental damage. The hazard risk equation (Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability / Capacity) summarises this relationship: the same earthquake magnitude will cause very different outcomes in different places depending on building quality, governance, emergency planning, public education and social inequality.

The Pressure and Release model (PAR) is a useful framework for exam answers. PAR traces root causes (such as political and economic systems), dynamic pressures (lack of education, urban migration, poor land management) and unsafe conditions (fragile housing, high population density) that, when combined with the triggering natural hazard, produce disasters. Use PAR to explain why a magnitude 7 earthquake in a low‑income megacity results in far greater loss of life and longer recovery than the same magnitude event in a high‑income, well‑regulated city.

Development, governance and geographic context therefore matter. Inequalities in access to education, healthcare and secure housing increase vulnerability, while effective governance, planning and infrastructure improve resilience. Comparing case studies from developed, emerging and developing countries is essential to show this interaction: studies of Kobe (1995), Christchurch (2011), Haiti (2010) and Nepal (2015) illustrate contrasts in preparedness, building standards, emergency response and recovery.

## Measuring, profiling and comparing hazards
To compare events and build hazard profiles you must know the commonly used scales and what they measure. The Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS) is the modern measure of earthquake energy release; it replaces older scales that saturated at high magnitudes. The Mercalli Intensity Scale measures observed impacts and shaking severity at specific locations, which is useful for explaining variation in damage across a city. For volcanoes, the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) rates eruptions by volume of material erupted and eruption column height.

Hazard profiling is a powerful exam tool: students should be able to compare hazards using attributes such as magnitude, speed of onset, areal extent, duration, frequency and spatial predictability. A hazard profile for a tsunami differs markedly from one for a volcano or earthquake; tsunamis have high speed and potentially wide areal extent but a predictable travel time once generated, whereas volcanic ash clouds may drift unpredictably and affect global systems such as aviation, as in the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption that disrupted air travel and demonstrated global interdependence.

Use profiles to explain differential impacts. For example, similar magnitude earthquakes can produce very different death tolls because of time of day, building collapse, secondary hazards and the presence or absence of warning systems.

## Prediction, preparedness and the hazard management cycle
Prediction accuracy varies by hazard type and location. Volcanoes often provide precursory signals such as increased seismicity, ground deformation and gas emissions; these can allow short‑term forecasts and evacuations where monitoring is strong. Earthquake prediction remains much more limited; while long‑term probabilistic forecasts and seismic hazard maps are valuable, precise short‑term prediction is not yet reliable. Tsunami early warning systems use seismic and sea‑level monitoring to trigger alerts and model tsunami travel times, allowing crucial hours for evacuation in many cases.

The hazard management cycle — mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery — structures effective practice. Mitigation aims to reduce exposure and vulnerability through measures such as land‑use zoning, building codes and engineered defences. Preparedness covers education, planning, drills and warning systems. Response covers emergency services, search and rescue and immediate aid, while recovery addresses reconstruction, rehabilitation and long‑term development.

Park’s model (the “disaster curve”) is a useful way to compare recovery trajectories between places. It plots quality of life against time before, during and after a hazard, showing the immediate drop and the shape and speed of recovery. Use Park’s model to evaluate why wealthy nations may exhibit a faster or more sustained recovery curve compared with poorer nations, and to discuss how international aid, insurance and local capacity affect recovery outcomes.

## Mitigation, adaptation and the role of players
Mitigation strategies include both structural responses such as earthquake‑resistant design, base isolation and retrofitting buildings, and non‑structural approaches like land‑use planning and critical infrastructure protection. Soft engineering and community preparedness — public education, drills, and local evacuation plans — are vital to reducing death tolls.

Adaptation recognises that hazards will continue and focuses on increasing resilience. This includes diversifying livelihoods, restoring natural buffers such as mangroves that reduce tsunami impacts, and adopting climate‑aware planning where tectonic processes interact with sea‑level rise.

Multiple players are involved: scientists provide monitoring and forecasts; local and national governments lead planning and emergency response; NGOs and international agencies coordinate aid and capacity building; engineers and planners design defences; insurers manage financial risk. Highlighting the roles and sometimes conflicting priorities of these players lends depth to synoptic responses and essays. Successful management often depends on coordination between players, clarity of responsibility and trust in institutions.

## Practical skills and useful case studies
Exam answers should draw on well‑chosen case studies that illustrate both physical processes and human responses. Use examples from developed, emerging and developing contexts to demonstrate contrasts. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami illustrates how lack of warning systems and coastal exposure can produce catastrophic loss of life across multiple countries. The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami show how high‑tech preparedness and robust infrastructure can reduce casualties but not prevent catastrophic impacts and longer‑term consequences such as the Fukushima nuclear crisis. Eyjafjallajökull (2010) shows the global reach of volcanic ash in a highly interconnected world.

Develop your skills in interpreting and using geographical data. Practice map analysis to identify plate boundary patterns, use block diagrams to describe different margin types, interpret tsunami travel‑time maps to explain warning times, and use correlation techniques to compare magnitude with deaths and economic damage. Familiarity with GIS concepts and the ability to discuss how spatial data can identify at‑risk zones will strengthen answers.

## Exam technique
Start answers to longer questions with a brief, focused introduction that states your approach and which case studies you will use. For explanation and analysis questions, move logically from physical cause to human consequence: explain the process (for example subduction producing megathrust earthquakes), then describe the hazard (shaking, tsunami) and finally evaluate the social, economic and environmental impacts, linking to vulnerability and resilience factors. When asked to assess or evaluate, use the PAR model, Park’s model or the hazard risk equation to give a structured argument and reach a clear judgement.

Always integrate place context and specific examples. A strong essay uses at least two contrasting case studies and refers explicitly to development, governance and local factors. Use hazard profiles or a short table in your planning to compare hazards quickly, and refer to monitoring and prediction limitations where relevant. When command words ask you to “suggest” or “explain”, tailor your depth: suggest questions require plausible reasoning for unfamiliar scenarios, while explain questions need causal links and physical detail.

Manage time by allocating minutes per mark and planning extended responses with a quick plan. Use labelled diagrams to support descriptions (for example cross‑sections of subduction or volcano anatomy), making sure to explain the diagram’s relevance. Where numerical or statistical skills are required, show working and interpret results in geographical terms.

Finally, evaluate evidence and uncertainty. A high‑level answer recognises data limitations, differing perspectives among players, and the challenge of predicting complex natural systems. Conclude with a clear, balanced judgement that reflects both physical processes and human factors. Practice past papers, refine your case studies and learn key technical terms so your explanations are precise and your evaluations convincing.
