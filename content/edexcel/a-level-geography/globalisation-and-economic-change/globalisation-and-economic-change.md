# Globalisation and Economic Change (A-level Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## What globalisation is and why it matters
Globalisation describes the widening, deepening and speeding up of global connections and interdependence. It shows itself through flows of goods, capital, information, ideas and people that cross national borders more easily than in the past. For geographers the key point is that these flows change places: they alter where jobs are located, how people identify with culture and community, and how environments are used and managed. Globalisation is not new — nineteenth century steam shipping and railways began the process — but the pace of change increased dramatically in the twentieth century with jet travel, container shipping and later, in the late twentieth and early twenty‑first centuries, with cheap digital communication. This time‑space compression (the shrinking of perceived distance) means economic decisions in one country can have rapid effects thousandsof kilometres away, creating opportunities and risks for different kinds of places and people.

## The principal drivers of economic globalisation
Technology and policy together drive global economic change. Improvements in transport — the steamship and railway in the nineteenth century, containerisation from the 1960s and air freight since the 1950s — reduced the cost and time of moving goods. Information and communication technologies (ICT), particularly the internet, mobile phones and global banking systems, have lowered the cost of coordinating multinational production and financial flows. At the same time political and economic decisions matter: international institutions (such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and World Bank), regional trade blocs and national policies to liberalise markets, attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and create special economic zones have encouraged transnational corporations (TNCs) to build global production networks. China’s 1978 Open Door policy and the rise of special economic zones such as Shenzhen are classic examples of how deliberate policy can re‑orient a national economy into global circuits of production and trade.

## Who benefits, who loses: spatial patterns and key players
Globalisation does not operate uniformly. Indices such as KOF and the AT Kearney/Foreign Policy Globalization Index reveal that some countries and cities are highly integrated into global systems while others remain peripheral. Transnational corporations are central players: they organise global value chains, allocate investment, and decide where factories, offices and research centres are located. Places with good infrastructure, skilled labour and political openness tend to attract investment and high‑value jobs. The result is a complex geography of winners and losers. The “global shift” of manufacturing to Asia has created rapid growth in many emerging economies — with large gains in GDP, infrastructure and employment in cities such as Shenzhen and Guangzhou — but has also left deindustrialised regions in developed countries, such as parts of the US “Rust Belt”, with high unemployment, dereliction and social problems. Meanwhile some locations are largely detached from globalisation, whether for political reasons (for example North Korea) or because of remoteness, poor infrastructure or weak governance.

## Economic change at the local and regional scale
Economic restructuring affects places at smaller scales as well. Urban and rural areas respond differently to the loss of traditional industries and to new investment. Regeneration and rebranding are strategies used by local and national governments to attract new industries, tourists and middle‑class residents. For example, dockland regeneration in many UK cities has transformed former industrial sites into mixed‑use quarters combining housing, offices and leisure, while “science parks” and technology clusters around major universities aim to create local competitive advantage. These processes affect local labour markets, housing affordability and social composition, producing winners among skilled newcomers and losers among displaced or long‑term low‑income residents. The measurement of success in regeneration is contested: economic indicators such as jobs and investment tell one story, while changes in lived experience, social cohesion and environmental quality tell another. Geographers therefore examine both quantitative evidence (employment data, income, deprivation indices such as the IMD) and qualitative evidence (oral accounts, media representations) to evaluate change.

## Social, cultural and environmental consequences
Globalisation shapes culture as well as the economy. Cultural diffusion spreads consumer brands, media and lifestyles widely, creating a visible “global culture” in many cities. This can bring benefits — access to new goods, ideas and opportunities — but it can also lead to cultural erosion, where languages, traditions and local practices decline. Migration is a key human outcome of economic globalisation: labour moves within countries (rural–urban migration that fuels megacity growth) and between countries (skilled and unskilled labour flows). Remittances from migrants are an important part of livelihoods in many source countries, while destination regions gain skills and labour but may experience social tensions linked to identity and integration. Environmental pressures are substantial: rapid industrialisation and urbanisation increase pollution, resource extraction to feed industrial demand damages ecosystems, and rising consumption in emerging middle classes increases global resource demand. Measuring these impacts requires a mixture of indicators: economic measures such as GDP per capita, social measures such as the Human Development Index (HDI), and inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curves. These methods help reveal how gains in aggregate wealth can coexist with widening inequalities and environmental degradation.

## Managing globalisation: policies, local responses and alternatives
Responses to globalisation come from many players and operate at many scales. National governments can promote openness to attract FDI or adopt protectionist measures to shield local industries. International institutions attempt to manage global trade and finance, while NGOs and local groups campaign for fairer trade, environmental protection and human rights standards. Local responses include community‑led initiatives such as transition towns and local sourcing projects that try to offset some negative effects by strengthening local economies, promoting sustainability and reducing ecological footprints. Businesses have responded through corporate social responsibility and sustainability reporting, though the effectiveness of voluntary approaches is debated. In some cases, countries or regions pursue a “managed integration” strategy that balances attracting investment with policies to improve skills, planning and social protection. The outcomes of these choices are uncertain; they depend on power relations between players, public attitudes, and the feasibility of long‑term cooperation on global issues such as climate change and resource security.

## Illustration through short examples
Concrete examples help anchor the concepts. China’s rapid industrialisation after 1978 shows how policy, infrastructure investment and openness to FDI can transform an economy and its place in global supply chains, but this growth has come with urban air pollution, regional inequality and rising resource demand. India’s TNC‑linked service sector demonstrates the economic benefits of outsourcing and global business services — higher employment in IT and call centres in cities such as Bangalore and Mumbai — alongside urban slums, infrastructure stress and uneven rural development. In developed economies, the social legacy of deindustrialisation is visible in former manufacturing towns where regeneration schemes (for instance Salford Quays in Greater Manchester) have created high‑value precincts but not always solved deeper social inequalities. These examples show the need to compare places inside and outside the UK and to think comparatively about scale and context.

## Exam technique
When answering examination questions on globalisation and economic change you should begin by defining the key terms clearly and placing them in a geographical framework. For shorter (e.g. 8–12 mark) answers use a focused structure: definition, brief explanation of key processes or causes, one or two well‑chosen examples and a short evaluative comment that recognises limits or alternative perspectives. For extended answers (18–24 or 20 marks) structure your response with an introduction that frames the issue, clear paragraphs that develop distinct lines of argument (causes, impacts, players, spatial variation), and a balanced conclusion that weighs evidence and reaches a judgement. Always integrate place‑based evidence: students who use contrasting examples from developed, emerging and developing contexts score more highly. Make explicit use of geographical concepts required by the specification (for example systems, feedback, interdependence, global production networks) and where relevant draw on synoptic themes: identify the players involved, show how attitudes and actions shape outcomes, and consider futures and uncertainties when evaluating policy options. Use quantitative evidence where possible — refer to indices like HDI, Gini or measures of globalisation — and complement numbers with qualitative insights from lived experience or media representations. Finally, answer the command word precisely: “explain” requires causes and mechanisms, “assess” requires balanced evaluation, and “suggest” or “evaluate” asks for justification with acknowledged uncertainty. Practise planning answers under timed conditions, annotate resource material carefully, and ensure you always end with a clear, evidence‑based conclusion.
