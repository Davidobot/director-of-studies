# The Water Cycle and Water Insecurity (A-level Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction
Water is the thread that connects atmosphere, land, ice and ocean. The water cycle (or hydrological cycle) describes how water is stored and moved through these reservoirs, from evaporation and precipitation to runoff, infiltration and groundwater flow. For people, reliable access to fresh water underpins health, food production, energy generation and economic activity. At A‑level it is important to understand the physical processes that control water movement, how those processes vary across space and time, and why mismatches between supply and demand produce water insecurity. This topic links physical systems (stores and fluxes, drainage basins, hydrographs) with human geography (demand drivers, governance and management) and requires you to think synoptically about actors, attitudes and futures.

## The global hydrological cycle: stores, fluxes and residence times
At the planetary scale the hydrological cycle is a largely closed system driven by solar energy and gravity. Most of the Earth’s water is saline in the oceans; only a small fraction is freshwater available for human use. Freshwater is stored in glaciers and ice caps, groundwater, lakes and rivers, the biosphere and a minute but climatically important pool in the atmosphere. Fluxes between these stores—evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation and runoff—vary in magnitude and seasonality. Residence times differ widely: water in the atmosphere cycles on timescales of days; river water may spend days or weeks in transit; groundwater and polar ice may store water for decades, centuries or much longer, so some stores act as slow or even non‑renewable resources at human timescales. Understanding the relative sizes of stores and the rates of exchange is essential because it constrains how much water can realistically be captured for use, and which stores might be vulnerable to long‑term depletion.

## Drainage basins, water budgets and hydrographs
At a local to regional scale the drainage basin is the most useful system to study. A drainage basin functions as an open system with inputs (precipitation), outputs (evapotranspiration, river discharge) and internal flows (infiltration, throughflow, groundwater flow and surface runoff). The water budget for a basin compares inputs and outputs across seasons and years and helps explain soil moisture availability, aquifer recharge and the timing of river flows. A river’s regime—the pattern of discharge through the year—reflects climate, geology, vegetation and human alterations. Storm hydrographs summarise the response of a catchment to a rainfall event: key characteristics include lag time, peak discharge and baseflow. Short lag times and high peaks occur where run‑off is rapid (steep relief, impermeable rocks, urbanisation), whereas permeable geology, vegetation and soil storage lengthen lag time and lower peaks. Being able to draw and annotate a labelled hydrograph, explain why it has its particular shape and link features to basin characteristics is a core skill for this topic.

## Short‑ and long‑term variability: droughts, floods and climate change
Water availability varies on multiple timescales. Short‑term variability includes intense storms that trigger flash floods and prolonged wet periods that saturate soils and raise river levels. Droughts can be meteorological (deficit of rainfall), agricultural (soil moisture shortage) or hydrological (reduced river and groundwater levels). Large‑scale climate patterns such as ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) modulate extremes and can produce linked drought or flood conditions across distant regions. Over longer timescales human‑forced climate change is altering precipitation patterns, accelerating glacier retreat and changing the seasonality of snowmelt, with direct consequences for river regimes and water storage. The key classroom task is to link physical cause to human impact: for example, glacier retreat reduces summer meltwater inputs to rivers that communities depend on, while warming increases evapotranspiration and can exacerbate drought even if precipitation does not fall dramatically.

## Water insecurity: causes and consequences
Water insecurity occurs when the supply of suitable water cannot meet demand for domestic use, agriculture, industry and ecosystems. The specification thresholds are useful to remember: water stress is often described where national per capita supply falls below about 1,700 m3 per year and water scarcity below about 1,000 m3 per year. Causes combine physical factors—arid climate, variable precipitation, sea‑water intrusion at coasts—and human drivers: population growth, urbanisation, agricultural expansion, over‑abstraction of groundwater and pollution. Socio‑economic capacity matters: economic scarcity occurs when water is physically available but infrastructure, governance or funds to deliver it are lacking. Consequences range from health problems where safe sanitation is absent, to loss of livelihoods when irrigation fails, to conflict where transboundary rivers are contested. Examples make the point: groundwater depletion in parts of India and the Central Valley in California threatens food production; the Colorado River’s over‑allocation leaves downstream users and ecosystems short; in 2018 Cape Town’s “Day Zero” drought highlighted how urban demand, governance and a prolonged dry spell combined to create a near‑crisis that was averted by strict demand management and emergency measures.

## Managing water supply: technological fixes and sustainable approaches
Responses to water insecurity lie along a spectrum from large engineering solutions to softer demand‑side and ecosystem‑based approaches. Mega‑infrastructure projects include dams, reservoirs and inter‑basin transfers (for example the South–North Water Transfer Project in China). These can secure supplies and store seasonally abundant water, but carry costs: ecosystem disruption, sediment trapping, displacement of people, evaporation losses and high capital and social costs. Desalination and groundwater mining provide options in water‑poor but wealthy or energy‑rich contexts; desalination is reliable for coastal cities but energy‑intensive and produces brine disposal problems.

Sustainable approaches focus on reducing demand and restoring natural services. Improving irrigation efficiency with drip systems, lining canals, adopting deficit or precision irrigation and shifting to less water‑intensive crops can reduce agricultural demand, which is the largest use worldwide. Urban measures include leak reduction, water metering and pricing incentives, greywater recycling, rainwater harvesting and public behaviour campaigns. Managed aquifer recharge can capture surplus water for later use, and restoration of wetlands and river floodplains enhances natural storage and reduces flood risk. Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and basin‑scale governance, including treaties for transboundary rivers, aim to coordinate players, balance uses and reduce conflict. Innovative policy tools—payment for ecosystem services, virtual water trade (importing water‑intensive goods rather than producing them locally), and investment in wastewater reuse—also feature in contemporary strategies. Case comparisons are instructive: Singapore combines desalination, wastewater recycling (NEWater) and strong demand management; contrasts with the Nile basin where competing upstream and downstream needs make cooperative solutions politically complex.

## Case studies and classroom/fieldwork opportunities
Use case studies to ground theory in place: Cape Town’s 2018 drought is a compact study of climate variability, urban demand, governance decisions and rapid behavioural change; Singapore shows a planned, multi‑vector approach to water security that integrates technology and policy; the Colorado and Nile systems illustrate complex transboundary issues and legacy infrastructure problems; the Mekong highlights how upstream dams affect downstream fisheries and sediment loads. Fieldwork is invaluable: urban water audits, investigation of local drainage catchments with hydrograph construction, measuring infiltration rates, surveying public attitudes to water use and mapping local supply infrastructure develop both practical skills and critical thinking. Quantitative analysis—calculating a water budget, plotting river regimes, using water poverty indices or computing per‑capita water availability—links directly to exam skills and to the assessment objectives.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions, be explicit and structured. Define key terms early (for example, what you mean by water stress or water insecurity) and use precise physical geography vocabulary: evapotranspiration, throughflow, baseflow, lag time, aquifer recharge. For shorter marks, write a concise point with a brief explanation and, where possible, an example. For 12– and 20‑mark essays, use a clear paragraph structure: a short introduction that defines the issue and outlines your approach, developed paragraphs that combine physical and human causes or processes with place‑specific evidence, and an evaluative conclusion that weighs competing explanations and considers uncertainties or future options. Always link examples back to the question: do not list case studies without analysis. For synoptic 24‑mark style questions, explicitly bring in the synoptic themes: identify the key players (governments, NGOs, TNCs, local communities), explore attitudes and actions (trade‑offs between development and conservation, contestation over pricing or allocation), and discuss futures and uncertainties (climate projections, demographic change, likely effectiveness of mitigation/adaptation). Where relevant, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different management strategies, consider equity and governance, and acknowledge scientific uncertainty. Finally, use data when provided: interpret graphs and maps with reference to trends and drivers, and draw clear conclusions that are justified by both theory and evidence. Practise drawing annotated diagrams—hydrographs, water budgets and the drainage‑basin schematic—as these communicate understanding quickly and earn credit.
