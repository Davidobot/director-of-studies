# Fieldwork, Geographical Skills and the NEA (Independent Investigation) (A-level Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview of requirements and purpose
Fieldwork and the Non‑Examination Assessment (NEA) are central to the A‑level Geography specification because they ask you to apply classroom theory to real places and to develop the practical, analytical and evaluative skills that are essential for higher study and for many careers. At A level you must complete a minimum of four days of fieldwork that cover both physical and human geography. This fieldwork underpins the independent investigation (the NEA), but the data you collect during those four days can be used in that investigation only if you are the originator and analyst of the relevant material. The NEA itself is an independent research project of 3000–4000 words in which you define a question or issue, gather and analyse quantitative and/or qualitative data, and produce a sustained, evidence‑based conclusion. The process is designed to test the full range of assessment objectives: knowledge and understanding (AO1), application and interpretation (AO2), and practical skills of data handling and evaluation (AO3).

## Geographical skills you must demonstrate
Success in both fieldwork and the NEA depends on demonstrating a balance of qualitative and quantitative skills. You will be expected to use geospatial technologies such as GIS and to collect geo‑located primary data as well as to interrogate secondary data sources. Quantitative techniques include descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, measures of dispersion), measures of association (scatterplots and lines of best fit), and inferential or relational tests such as Spearman’s rank, t‑tests and chi‑squared where appropriate. You will also need to understand and be able to present data with clarity using maps, graphs, hydrographs, box plots, Lorenz curves and proportional symbols. Qualitative methods are equally important: structured and semi‑structured interviews, content analysis of local media, photographic interpretation, field sketches and participant observation will help you to explain people’s perceptions, attitudes and behaviours. Above all, examiners look for evidence that you can choose appropriate methods, justify your choices, critically appraise the strengths and limitations of your approaches and integrate qualitative and quantitative findings into coherent geographical explanations.

## Planning fieldwork: practical and ethical considerations
Good fieldwork begins with careful planning that considers the research question, the context, required equipment, health and safety, and ethical implications. When choosing a study question think about scale and manageability: a clear, focused question about a neighbourhood, a river reach, a coastal cell or a small urban redevelopment area is far more effective than a vague, wide‑ranging title. Plan sampling so it is explicit and defendable; for example, stratified sampling along different beach zones, systematic transects across a river profile, or quota sampling for household surveys in contrasting wards. Health and safety must be thought through and recorded: use school risk assessments, consult weather forecasts and design lone‑working protocols if students will be collecting data without direct supervision. Ethical issues include informed consent for interviews, protecting anonymity where required and respecting cultural sensitivities when working with communities. Teachers can give general guidance on risk and ethics but must not provide candidates with detailed solutions or templates that would compromise independence.

## Designing and managing the Independent Investigation
The NEA is an independent piece of work in which you must demonstrate the ability to research, plan and execute an enquiry. Start by researching the theoretical and place‑based context so your aim or hypothesis is grounded in geographical literature and linked to the specification. The investigation proposal should clearly indicate your aim, sub‑questions, anticipated methods and a sampling strategy; teachers will check that the investigation is feasible and appropriate but must not rewrite titles or supply finished analytical steps. During fieldwork you may collaborate with peers to collect data, but analysis, interpretation and written synthesis must be your own. Time management is essential: draft a timeline that schedules literature review, field days, data processing, analysis, write up and editing. Adhere to the recommended word range of 3000–4000 words; examiners do not impose a strict penalty for being slightly over or under, but verbosity or omission can prevent you from evidencing the assessment criteria fully.

## Data collection, analysis and presentation
Collect primary data with accuracy and record metadata carefully: date, time, weather, instruments used, calibration details and location coordinates. Use GIS or digital mapping where possible to geo‑reference sample points and to combine spatial datasets. When analysing quantitative data make appropriate use of measures of central tendency and dispersion, and use statistical tests where they add value and are correctly applied and interpreted. For qualitative data apply coding and thematic analysis; triangulate findings from interviews, observations and secondary documents to strengthen arguments. Present findings in a variety of ways that suit the data: well‑labelled graphs, annotated maps, hydrographs for river studies and cross‑section diagrams for coastal and glacial work. Critically evaluate the reliability and representativeness of your data: discuss measurement errors, sampling bias and the consequences of any missing data. In the evaluation, reflect on how alternative methods or repeated sampling might alter your conclusions and identify the wider implications for the place you studied.

## Teacher guidance, authenticity and assessment controls
Teachers have an important role as facilitators: they may provide broad parameters for topics, advise on the practicalities of field techniques and safety, and confirm that a proposed title could meet the assessment criteria. What teachers must not do is supply candidates with a choice of ready‑made titles to choose from, give detailed, individualised feedback that tells the candidate exactly how to meet assessment criteria, or provide primary or secondary data that should have been collected by the student. Any specific assistance beyond permitted guidance must be recorded and taken into account in marking. Each candidate must complete the Independent Investigation Form and a declaration to authenticate that the work is their own. Schools must securely store drafts and final submissions, keep signed declarations, and undertake internal standardisation where more than one assessor marks work. The NEA is internally assessed to the published criteria and externally moderated; therefore clear annotation, justification of marks and honest recording of any assistance are essential.

## Examples, exemplification and common good topics
Strong NEA topics are place‑based, focused and linked to clear processes or issues from the specification. Examples include investigating how beach sediment size and shape vary along a drift‑aligned coast and testing hypotheses using t‑tests and size distribution analysis; analysing the effect of urban greening on surface temperature and pedestrian comfort using transect temperature readings and surveys; or examining perceptions of place change by comparing oral histories, social media representations and IMD figures in a regenerated neighbourhood. Fieldwork that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches often produces richer conclusions: for instance, linking interview data about community resilience with measured post‑event changes in river channel form can illustrate both lived experience and geomorphological response. Use accessible contexts for study: local rivers, parks, urban centres or nearby coastline work well because they are logistically manageable and allow repeated sampling if needed.

## Exam technique
When writing your NEA and preparing for synoptic assessments, structure matters. Begin the investigation with a concise contextual introduction that sets the place, frames the issue and states a clear aim and sub‑questions. In the methods section justify your choices: explain why particular sampling strategies, instruments and statistical tests are appropriate and how you accounted for reliability and ethics. Present results clearly, using annotated figures and tables that are referred to in the text, then move to interpretation: explain what the data show and link findings to geographical theory and the wider context. In your conclusions synthesise how the evidence answers your aim and consider alternative explanations and limitations. Use precise geographical terminology and embed quantitative evidence rather than leaving it as an appendix. For exam papers, practise answering resource‑based questions under timed conditions, plan extended responses using PEEL (point, evidence, explanation, link) paragraphs and include layered synoptic links between players, attitudes and futures where relevant. Above all, demonstrate analytical depth, critical evaluation and an ability to locate specific findings within broader geographical debates.
