# Glaciated Landscapes and Change (A-level Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: what glaciated landscapes are and why they matter
Glaciated landscapes are places shaped by the action of ice—by glaciers and ice sheets operating as dynamic systems of erosion, transport and deposition. These landscapes include current ice-covered regions such as Greenland and Antarctica, upland valley systems with cirque and valley glaciers like parts of the Alps, and relict or formerly glaciated lowlands where Pleistocene ice once flowed, leaving features such as drumlin fields and erratics. The cryosphere (the Earth’s frozen water) is an integral part of the global system: it stores freshwater, influences sea level and interacts with the carbon and water cycles. For an A-level student, understanding glaciated landscapes links physical processes, long-term climate change, and human uses and impacts, and it provides ideal contexts for fieldwork and quantitative skills such as mapping, measurement and statistical analysis.

## Ice, climate and the timescales of change
Glaciation is not a single event but the product of repeated cold (glacial) and warm (interglacial) phases through the Quaternary, especially the Pleistocene. Milankovitch cycles—variations in Earth’s orbit, axial tilt and precession—are a primary driver of these long-term climate rhythms, modifying solar input and triggering growth or decay of ice sheets. Superimposed on those slow cycles are shorter-term drivers such as volcanic eruptions and natural oscillations like ENSO; in the Anthropocene, human-driven greenhouse gas emissions now add a new, rapidly changing influence on glacier mass balance.

At the scale of individual glaciers the key concept is mass balance: the difference between accumulation (snowfall, avalanches, wind deposition) and ablation (melting, sublimation, calving). Where accumulation exceeds ablation the glacier grows; where ablation dominates it retreats. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) marks the boundary between net gain and net loss on a glacier and shifts upward as the climate warms. For exam answers, link changes in mass balance to both local impacts—reduced summer meltwater supply downstream—and to global consequences, such as sea level rise where ice sheets lose mass.

## Glaciers as systems: movement and processes
Glaciers move because gravity acts on ice that behaves plastically under pressure. Movement is achieved by internal deformation of ice crystals, basal sliding where meltwater reduces friction at the bed, and processes such as regelation that allow ice to flow around obstacles. Polar glaciers, where the base remains below the pressure melting point, and temperate glaciers, with warm beds and abundant meltwater, show different movement regimes and therefore different erosive potentials.

Erosion under glaciers occurs chiefly by two mechanisms. Abrasion grinds rock fragments embedded in the ice across the bed, producing polished rock and striations. Quarrying or plucking loosens and removes blocks when meltwater refreezes in bedrock joints and pries rock away as the glacier moves. These processes combine to deepen and widen valleys, sculpt cirques (corries) and steepen interfluves. Englacial and subglacial drainage routes transport sediment and water; supraglacial streams and seasonal melt can produce dramatic outflows and store energy that may be released as floods. In answers, explain how basal conditions (bedrock, presence of meltwater) and glacier thickness control the rate of movement and the intensity of erosion.

## Erosional landforms and landscape signatures
Erosion by valley and ice-sheet glaciation yields a suite of classic landforms used to reconstruct ice extent and direction. At the head of upland glaciers, cirques or corries form where nivation, freeze–thaw and glacial plucking hollow a basin often with a small tarn. Narrow arêtes and pyramidal peaks (horns) result from headward erosion of adjacent cirques. Down-valley, V-shaped river valleys are transformed into U-shaped troughs with truncated spurs where glacial abrasion truncates interlocking spurs. Hanging valleys, left high above the glacial trough floor, form where tributary glaciers had less erosive power and often host waterfalls.

Ice-sheet scouring produces broader features: roches moutonnées show asymmetric smoothing on stoss sides and plucked lee sides; crag-and-tail landforms record resistant blocks protecting downstream tails of softer material. Fjords are drowned glacial troughs where sea-level rise has flooded glaciated valleys; Norway and the west coast of Scotland provide clear examples. For examination work, be prepared to compare upland valley glaciation with ice-sheet scouring, linking landform scale to ice thickness and flow regime.

## Depositional and meltwater landforms: reading the sedimentary record
Deposition by ice and meltwater leaves a different set of landforms and sediment characteristics. Till or glacial drift is the unstratified, poorly sorted mixture dropped directly by ice and found in moraines—lateral, medial, terminal and recessional—each indicating ice margin positions. Drumlins are streamlined, elongate hills of compacted till that record former ice flow direction; drumlin fields, such as in parts of Northern Ireland and Cumbria, allow reconstruction of ice movement patterns. Erratics—discrete large boulders transported far from their source—are useful provenance indicators.

Meltwater reworks glacial debris, producing fluvioglacial or outwash deposits that are well-sorted, stratified and show imbrication, forming features such as eskers (sinuous ridges of sand and gravel deposited in subglacial channels), kames (mounded drift) and kame terraces. Outwash plains or sandurs form beyond ice margins where braided meltwater channels spread sediment. Kettle holes and kettle lakes mark sites of buried ice blocks that melted to leave hollows. In essays, stress the contrasting sedimentary textures and sorting between glacial till and fluvioglacial deposits, and explain how those differences help reconstruct processes and environments.

## Periglacial processes and relict features
Periglacial environments, occurring beyond ice margins under permafrost conditions, produce distinctive landforms through freeze–thaw and seasonal frost action. Patterned ground, frost heave, solifluction and pingos (ice-cored mounds) form in permafrost landscapes. Loess—wind-blown silt deposited downwind of glaciated areas—creates fertile blankets in some lowland areas and can be used as evidence of past periglacial climates. When answering questions that require contrast between glacial and periglacial processes, focus on mechanism and timescale: periglacial change is active where permafrost persists and has its own geomorphic signature separate from direct glacial erosion.

## Human uses, threats and management of glaciated landscapes
Glaciated and formerly glaciated landscapes are valued for water resources, hydroelectric power, tourism, grazing and cultural heritage. Alpine valleys support farming, skiing and mountain tourism; the Himalaya and Andes supply meltwater critical to downstream agriculture and hydropower. However, their fragility makes them vulnerable. Climate change is driving glacier recession globally—from the retreat of Himalayan valley glaciers to the rapid losses across the European Alps and Greenland—altering seasonal water supply and increasing hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Human pressures from tourism, infrastructure and resource extraction can accelerate erosion, damage habitats and change sediment yields.

Management responses combine conservation and practical adaptation. Protected area designations (national parks, World Heritage Sites) can regulate land use and tourism; monitoring programmes and early-warning systems can reduce risk from GLOFs and avalanches. At local levels, approaches include visitor management in popular valleys (path zoning, surface reinforcement) and engineering interventions where necessary, but be cautious in exam answers: engineering solutions often redistribute risk and can be costly. Effective management requires multi-scale stakeholder coordination—from local communities and park authorities to international bodies—and must balance preservation, sustainable use and adaptation to ongoing climatic change. Use Yosemite Valley as a teaching example of how a protected status manages tourism alongside conservation, and the Himalaya to illustrate transboundary concerns over water security.

## Fieldwork and quantitative skills: turning observations into evidence
Glaciated landscapes are ideal for fieldwork that combines quantitative measurement and qualitative interpretation. Typical investigations include mapping landforms on OS maps and aerial imagery, measuring valley cross-sections to identify U-shaped profiles, conducting drumlin morphometry and orientation surveys, analysing till fabric with rose diagrams, and sampling sediment size and roundness across an outwash plain to apply t-tests or measures of central tendency. Mass balance calculations, equilibrium line position estimates and time-series analysis of glacier recession rates using satellite imagery or historical maps introduce valuable numerical and GIS skills. When writing up investigations, integrate field data with secondary sources—geological maps, BGS drift maps, published recession rates—and explicitly discuss uncertainty and measurement error. Examiner mark schemes reward clear justification of sampling strategies, careful data presentation, appropriate statistical tests and critical evaluation of methods.

## Exam technique
Begin answers by directly addressing the question and using precise geographical terminology—terms such as abrasion, plucking, equilibrium line altitude, till, esker, cirque and mass balance must appear where relevant. For 12- and 20-mark extended responses, allocate time to a clear structure: a brief introduction defining key terms and outlining the approach, a main body where processes and landforms are explained with specific examples (draw on both UK and international contexts), and a conclusion that offers evaluation or judged perspective. Use place-specific examples to illustrate points—Scottish corries and fjords of Norway for erosional features, drumlin fields in northwest Britain for depositional evidence, Himalayan glacier retreat for contemporary climate impacts—and link processes to human consequences and management. When required to use geographical skills, refer explicitly to maps, diagrams or datasets, describe patterns (direction, magnitude, time trends) and include simple quantitative statements (rates of retreat, orientation statistics, mass balance changes). For synoptic questions, make connections to wider themes—players (who is responsible for management), attitudes and actions (conflicts over tourism or water use) and futures and uncertainties (mitigation and adaptation choices). Finally, practice past-paper questions under timed conditions, annotate diagrams carefully, and in longer answers balance description with explanation and evaluation to reach the highest mark bands.
