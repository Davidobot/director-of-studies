# Religious texts, authority and sources of wisdom (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction: why texts and authority matter
Religious texts and other sources of wisdom are central to how believers understand the world, make moral choices and shape their communities. In GCSE Religious Studies you are asked not only to know what different religions teach, but to explain why particular texts, traditions and authorities carry weight for believers. This means learning the names and contents of key scriptures, understanding how religious communities interpret them, and recognising how religious authority interacts with reason, experience and wider society. Throughout the course you will compare religious sources with non-religious ways of deciding what is right and true, so it helps to keep thinking about both what religious sources say and how they are used in practice.

## What counts as a religious text or source of wisdom
Religious texts include scriptures that communities treat as especially authoritative, but sources of wisdom also extend to ritual practice, ethical teachings, stories and respected commentaries. For Christians the Bible (Old and New Testaments) is primary and appears in many forms: the Nicene Creed summarises core belief, while the Catechism and church councils shape interpretation, especially in Catholic Christianity. Muslims regard the Qur’an as the direct word of God revealed to Muhammad; the Hadith literature records the Prophet’s words and actions and is central to understanding the Qur’an in Sunni and Shi’a traditions. Jews rely on the Tenakh (Hebrew Bible) together with the Talmud, which contains rabbinic law and commentary. Hindus draw on a wide range of scriptures including the Vedas, Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, while Sikhs consider the Guru Granth Sahib to be their living guide. Buddhists refer to the Dhamma recorded in various sutras and Pali texts; some schools place different emphasis on particular collections. These texts serve functions such as teaching doctrine, giving moral guidance, prescribing worship and preserving religious memory.

## Authority beyond the written word: tradition, leaders and community
Authority in religion often rests on more than a book. Tradition—ways of thinking and acting handed down through generations—gives meaning to texts and shapes daily practice. In Catholic Christianity the magisterium (pope and bishops) and ecumenical councils interpret the Bible and issue authoritative teaching, while papal encyclicals such as those on social teaching influence modern Catholic responses to ethical questions. In Islam religious scholars and legal schools (madhabs), together with the community’s consensus, guide the application of Qur’anic principles; Shi’a Islam also honours the authority of Imams. Judaism relies on rabbinic interpretation: the Talmud and later responsa explain how Torah laws apply in changing circumstances. Sikhism emphasises the teachings in the Guru Granth Sahib and the life-example of the Gurus; the Sangat (community) and institutions like the langar play an authoritative role in communal life. Even where texts are central, the interpreter—priest, imam, rabbi, guru or teacher—helps to make scripture relevant to lived experience, so studying authority means studying people and institutions as well as pages.

## Revelation, experience and other sources of wisdom
Many believers accept that God or the divine acts in history and in personal lives. Revelation—God making truth known to humans—appears in different forms: the Qur’an is described as direct revelation, Christians speak of revelation supremely in the person of Jesus, and Sikhs recall Guru Nanak’s revelation experiences. Religious experiences such as visions, miracles, conversions and mystical encounters can be powerful sources of personal conviction and communal authority; Lourdes or Pentecost are examples that shape belief and practice. Philosophical arguments and reason remain important too. Design and cosmological arguments have been used across religious traditions to argue for a creator, while scriptures are often read alongside natural science. Non-religious sources such as conscience, human experience, ethical theories and scientific evidence also inform moral decisions; many religious communities engage with these in forming responses to modern issues. Understanding sources of wisdom therefore requires attention to private experience, communal testimony and rational argument.

## Interpreting scripture: literal, contextual and critical approaches
A crucial part of this GCSE is recognising that people read texts in different ways. Some take a literal approach, seeing scripture as an exact record to be followed word for word. Others read texts metaphorically or symbolically, accepting that historical context, genre and language shape meaning. Historical-critical methods ask about the human authors, historical circumstances and literary forms found in scripture; this approach helps explain divergent Christian readings of Genesis, or different Muslim views of certain Qur’anic passages. Tradition shapes interpretation too: the same text can support different positions on issues such as gender roles, medical ethics or economic justice. Teachers should encourage students to practise explaining how a passage might be read by one group in one way, and by another group differently, and to show how interpretation affects belief and behaviour. In exam answers, it is good practice to name the text, explain its meaning in context, and then show how different groups might interpret it.

## How texts and authority shape belief and practice: examples
Religious texts and authorities are not abstract; they lead to concrete actions and institutional choices. Christian doctrines such as the Incarnation and Resurrection, grounded in the New Testament, inform worship (the Eucharist, Christmas and Easter) and ethical commitments such as care for the poor. Catholic teaching on marriage and sexual ethics cites scripture, tradition and papal teaching when addressing contraception, divorce or same-sex relationships. The Qur’an and Hadith establish practices such as prayer (salah), fasting in Ramadan and obligations to care for the needy (zakah); legal rulings and community norms guide how these are carried out in diverse cultures. Jewish mitzvot, explored and applied through the Talmud, regulate food laws, Sabbath observance and ritual life. Hindu ideas of karma and dharma, taken from the Gita and Upanishads, influence views on duty, caste and liberation. Buddhist teachings on suffering and the Eightfold Path inform meditation practices and compassion-based ethics. Sikh principles of sewa and equality, rooted in the Guru Granth Sahib and tradition, shape institutions such as the langar and community service. Showing this practical link is essential in exam answers: name the text or authority, explain the teaching, and then show its effect on real life.

## Comparing religious and non-religious sources; issues of authority today
Modern plural societies bring religious authority into conversation with secular laws, human rights and scientific insights. Debates about bioethics, environmental responsibility or equal rights often require religious voices to explain how ancient texts apply today. Non-religious worldviews such as humanism offer alternative sources of authority: reason, empathy, human rights and scientific consensus. Many religious communities respond by reinterpreting texts in the light of new knowledge, engaging in interfaith dialogue, or defending traditional readings. Some tensions are predictable: when scripture seems at odds with scientific accounts, believers may adopt metaphorical readings or argue for complementary understandings. Teachers can help students evaluate sources by asking whether a source is historically reliable, widely accepted within the tradition, or adaptable; whether it addresses modern concerns; and how persuasive it is to believers and outsiders alike.

## Exam technique
When you answer exam questions about religious texts, authority and sources of wisdom you need to combine clear knowledge (AO1) with evaluation (AO2). For AO1, be precise: name the text or authority, give a short quote or reference if you can (for example, mention Genesis 1–3 when discussing creation or Surah 2:183 when explaining fasting), and explain the teaching in your own words. Place the source in context by saying which tradition uses it and whether interpretation varies within that religion. For AO2, analyse how convincing the source is as guidance, consider alternative sources (such as reason, experience or human rights), and reach a balanced conclusion. A good long answer will usually begin by explaining the source (AO1), then examine the influence of that source on belief and practice with examples (AO1/AO2), and finally weigh strengths and weaknesses before giving a reasoned judgement (AO2). Use comparative language where appropriate to show similarities and differences across religions or between religious and non-religious positions. Remember to meet the SPaG expectations by writing clearly, checking spelling of key terms (for instance Qur’an, Torah, Guru Granth Sahib), and using specialist vocabulary such as “revelation”, “tradition”, “interpretation” and “magisterium”. Manage your time so you can plan, write and proofread answers; examiners reward clarity, accurate use of sources, balanced evaluation and a justified conclusion.
