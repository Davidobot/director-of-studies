# Creation, humanity and stewardship (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Creation accounts and the nature of God
Religions offer different but overlapping ways of explaining how the universe began and what that origin tells believers about God or ultimate reality. In the Bible, Genesis 1–3 presents a structured account in which God brings the world into being by divine word, ending with the creation of humankind “in the image of God.” Christians often use these chapters to reflect on God’s power, goodness and order. In Christianity the opening of John’s Gospel (John 1:1–18) links creation with the divine Word (Logos), presenting Jesus as intimately involved in creation. In Islam the Qur’an speaks of God (Allah) as Creator and Sustainer, and passages such as the declaration that humans have been appointed as God’s khalifah (vice‑regent) on earth are used to explain human responsibilities. Hindu and Buddhist accounts approach origins differently: Hindu texts describe cyclical cosmologies and the presence of Brahman (ultimate reality) manifesting as many forms, while Buddhist teaching focuses less on a creator deity and more on dependent origination, a continuing process rather than a single event. These different frameworks shape how believers understand the world’s value and their place within it.

## Literal and metaphorical readings
Students must recognise that sacred creation texts are interpreted in a variety of ways. Some believers read Genesis literally, describing six days of divine creation; others read it as metaphorical or theological poetry that conveys truths about God, purpose and moral order rather than scientific detail. The same is true across traditions: Hindu myths about cosmic cycles are often treated as symbolic rather than literal history, and many Muslims accept scientific accounts of the universe while seeing them as compatible with Qur’anic statements about creation. Catholic thought provides a useful example of this flexibility: contemporary Catholic teaching allows for non-literal readings and accepts scientific explanations such as the Big Bang and evolution, emphasising that scientific accounts and religious meaning answer different kinds of questions. Understanding the distinction between “how” (scientific mechanisms) and “why” (purpose and meaning) helps explain why faith communities often hold diverse views without losing the core of their beliefs.

## What it means to be human: image, soul and self
Central to the study of creation is the question of human nature. In Christianity and Judaism the idea of humans being made “in the image of God” (imago Dei) underpins claims about human dignity, moral responsibility and the special status of human life. For many Christians this supports the sanctity of life and human rights. Islam similarly stresses the special status of humans as God’s khalifah, responsible for ethical stewardship. Hinduism and Sikhism offer different emphases: Hindu thought teaches the atman (eternal self) and its relationship with Brahman, which grounds beliefs about reincarnation and moksha (liberation). Sikh teaching emphasises the possibility of uniting with God through devotion and ethical living. Buddhism, with its doctrine of anatta (no permanent self), challenges the notion of an unchanging soul, instead focusing on the processes that make up a person and the ethical consequences of actions (karma). These theological and philosophical differences lead to distinct moral reasoning about issues such as rights, personhood and responsibility.

## Stewardship, dominion and ethical responsibility
Two contrasting ideas often appear in religious responses to the natural world: dominion and stewardship. “Dominion,” sometimes read as licence to exploit, has been interpreted by some as permission to use nature for human benefit. Many religious thinkers, however, stress “stewardship”: the idea that humans are caretakers who must protect and preserve creation. Christian, Islamic and Jewish scriptures contain resources for stewardship—calls to tend the garden, to act with justice and to preserve community welfare. In Islam the concept of khalifah carries an ethical obligation to care for the earth, while in Sikhism sewa (selfless service) and the principle of equality extend to how people treat the environment and each other. Hindu teachings on ahimsa (non‑violence) and reverence for living beings also support environmental care. These religious principles are often applied in contemporary debates about pollution, resource use and climate change, and they form the ethical basis for many faith-based environmental initiatives.

## Science and religion: evolution, cosmology and responses
Modern science—cosmology, evolutionary biology and ecology—raises questions and sometimes tensions for religious belief. Some people see science and religion as in conflict, particularly where a literal reading of creation narratives clashes with evolutionary theory. Others find them complementary: scientific explanations describe mechanisms and processes, while religion addresses meaning and values. Across traditions there are influential figures and statements showing compatibility: for example, the Belgian priest and scientist Georges Lemaître proposed the idea now known as the Big Bang, and contemporary religious leaders have repeatedly emphasised that evolution and faith need not be opposed. Many religious communities therefore develop nuanced positions that accept scientific evidence while maintaining theological convictions about purpose, value and moral responsibility.

## Value and sanctity of life: ethical implications
Beliefs about creation and what it means to be human are central to moral debates about abortion, euthanasia and medical ethics. Where traditions teach the sanctity of life—often grounded in the belief that life is a gift from God or that the human person bears special dignity—there is strong resistance to practices that intentionally end life. For example, Catholic teaching affirms the sanctity of life from conception and is broadly opposed to abortion and euthanasia, while also encouraging compassionate care and hospice services. In Islam debates often hinge on the concept of ensoulment and the stages of fetal development, producing a range of positions among scholars. Hindu and Buddhist approaches take account of karma and compassion; views on abortion and euthanasia vary accordingly, with careful attention to intention, suffering and ethical duties. These differences show how creation beliefs translate into distinct moral conclusions, and why discussions typically involve both religious reasoning and ethical theories such as utilitarianism, natural law or situation ethics.

## Religious action for the environment and animal ethics
Religious responses to environmental threats are not only theoretical; they include practical programmes and community actions. Many faith groups run charities and campaigns: Christian organisations such as CAFOD and Christian Aid work on development and environmental justice, Muslim organisations promote stewardship through community projects, Sikhs and Hindus may support river cleanses or cow protection schemes associated with religious duty, and Buddhist engaged movements promote climate action informed by compassion for all beings. Debates about animal rights and experimentation also reflect religious teaching: some faiths emphasise kind treatment and limits on suffering, while ethical theories such as utilitarianism are sometimes used to justify or oppose particular practices. Teaching about stewardship therefore includes both the principles that inspire care and the concrete actions communities take to protect creation.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on creation, humanity and stewardship, aim to show both clear factual knowledge (AO1) and well‑reasoned analysis and evaluation (AO2). Start by defining key terms—creation, stewardship, sanctity of life, imago Dei—so markers know you understand the language. Use specific examples from religions studied: cite Genesis 1–3 or John 1 for Christian views, Qur’anic references and the idea of khalifah for Islam, atman and moksha for Hinduism, anatta and dependent origination for Buddhism, and references to sewa or the Mool Mantar for Sikhism. For short questions be precise; for explain questions develop a reasoned paragraph with a supporting example or source. For evaluate/’to what extent’ questions present two sides of the argument: outline a religious or scientific position, give reasons and examples, raise a relevant counterargument and weigh strengths and weaknesses before reaching a justified conclusion. Use ethical theory where appropriate to show breadth of understanding, and remember to answer the precise question asked rather than writing everything you know. Finally, clear structure, accurate spelling and specialist terms will help secure marks for SPaG and demonstrate disciplined exam technique.
