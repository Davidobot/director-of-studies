# Religion, peace, conflict and pacifism (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview of the topic and why it matters
Religion, peace, conflict and pacifism is a central theme in GCSE Religious Studies because it asks students to connect beliefs with real moral choices and global events. The topic explores how religious teachings shape responses to war, violence, justice and reconciliation, and it asks whether violence can ever be justified. Exam questions will expect knowledge of beliefs and practices from the religion you study for this Area of Study, plus the ability to explain and evaluate different viewpoints. To do well you need to show clear factual knowledge, understanding of sources of wisdom and authority, and the ability to analyse and weigh arguments for and against conflict, pacifism and forms of punishment.

## Religious beliefs that shape attitudes to peace and conflict
Different religions offer distinct starting points for thinking about violence. In Christianity, the example and teachings of Jesus are central: his emphasis on love, mercy and reconciliation often leads Christians to favour peacemaking and forgiveness, while other Christian traditions also accept the idea of a morally justified war under strict conditions. In Islam the concept of peace is reflected in the word Islam itself and in teachings that stress mercy and justice; at the same time the Qur’an and hadith include guidance about legitimate defence and the restrictions that must govern it. Buddhism tends to focus on non-harming, compassion and the avoidance of greed and hatred, so many Buddhists favour pacifist approaches, though history shows a range of responses. Hinduism and Sikhism include teachings about duty, righteousness and the protection of the innocent; in the Bhagavad Gita a form of duty-bound fighting is discussed, while Sikh tradition also values the ideal of the saint-soldier who resists oppression. Judaism gives strong weight to the sanctity of life and justice and contains both commandments that protect life and passages that reflect conflict in particular historical contexts. These core beliefs—about the nature of God or ultimate reality, human duty, and the sanctity of life—help explain why religious communities may support peacemaking or, in some cases, armed resistance.

## Pacifism and non-violent responses
Pacifism is the position that violence and war are always wrong. Religious pacifists base their view on the belief that taking life contradicts divine commands, the sanctity of life, or the goal of spiritual transformation. Christian pacifism draws on Jesus’ teachings such as “turn the other cheek” and the Sermon on the Mount to argue that non-violence and active peacemaking are the Christian response to evil. The Quaker tradition and other peace churches exemplify committed pacifism, often engaging in non-violent protest and reconciliation work. In Hindu and Jain thought, ahimsa—non-harm—has been powerful in shaping movements of non-violent resistance; Mahatma Gandhi famously combined ahimsa with political activism to oppose injustice. Buddhist pacifism flows from the precepts against killing and from a compassionate ethic that seeks to reduce suffering. In each case, religious pacifists often practice constructive alternatives, such as civil resistance, negotiation, sanctuary for victims, or projects that address the root causes of conflict. When you explain pacifism in the exam, show how specific teachings support it and offer concrete examples, such as civil rights movements, interfaith peace groups, or religious aid organisations that promote reconciliation.

## The Just War tradition and religiously framed armed resistance
Not all religious responses to conflict are pacifist. The Just War tradition, which has deep roots in Christian theology, sets out strict criteria for when it is morally permissible to use force. These criteria typically include just cause, legitimate authority, right intention, probability of success, proportionality and last resort. Catholic teaching has developed Just War theory in detail, and many other Christians reference similar principles when arguing that force can be justified to protect the innocent. In Islam the concept of jihad is complex and multifaceted; while jihad primarily means struggle in the way of God, classical sources distinguish between spiritual struggle and armed defence, with strict rules about who may fight and how non-combatants must be protected. Sikh tradition has also wrestled with the question of armed resistance, teaching the importance of defending the helpless while maintaining a spiritual life. When discussing Just War in exams it is important to explain the conditions that make war permissible and then evaluate whether those conditions are realistic in modern conflicts. Use examples such as international peacekeeping, humanitarian intervention, or historical cases to illustrate how Just War principles have been applied or challenged.

## Peacemaking, reconciliation and restorative justice
Religions not only provide reasons for rejecting or justifying violence; they also offer positive practices for building peace. Peacemaking involves active efforts to prevent conflict, to mediate disputes, and to restore relationships after harm. Christian churches may emphasise forgiveness, confession and restorative practices that seek to heal victims and offenders. Jewish traditions emphasise justice and repair, and the principle of pikuach nefesh (the preservation of life) prioritises saving life over ritual observance. Islamic teachings stress compassion and reconciliation, and many Muslim organisations work in interfaith initiatives to build trust across communities. Buddhism’s emphasis on compassion and mindfulness has inspired peace projects that focus on inner transformation as well as social change. Restorative justice models, used in many places today, aim to repair harm through mediated encounters, making amends, and community involvement rather than focusing only on punishment. When explaining these ideas, show how religious teachings support practical peacemaking work, and give examples such as community reconciliation commissions, faith-based charities, or well-known figures who campaigned for social justice and non-violent change.

## Weapons, terrorism and modern ethical challenges
Modern warfare raises issues that classical teachings did not anticipate, and religious responses vary. Weapons of mass destruction pose an acute moral problem because they cause indiscriminate suffering and long-term environmental harm. Many religious leaders and communities condemn WMD because they violate the sanctity of life and the principles of proportionality and discrimination between combatants and civilians. Terrorism raises related ethical questions about violence in the name of a cause; religious condemnations of terrorism emphasise that the deliberate targeting of civilians is unjustifiable and often contrary to authoritative teachings. At the same time, some believers point to structural injustice, occupation, or persecution to explain why violent extremism emerges, and they call for political and social solutions alongside moral criticism. In an exam answer you should distinguish between condemning violence in principle and understanding its causes, and you should be ready to consider whether religious responses focus more on moral teaching, on practical relief for victims, or on political engagement to prevent further violence.

## Ethical frameworks and how religions use them
To analyse questions about peace and conflict you will often apply ethical theories alongside religious teachings. Situation ethics, which argues that moral decisions depend on context and seeks the most loving outcome, is sometimes used to justify choices that depart from strict rules, particularly in dilemmas like humanitarian intervention or difficult choices about prisoners and torture. Utilitarian thinking, which aims to maximise overall good, can be used to justify or criticise actions such as strategic bombing or the development of deterrents, but religions that emphasise sanctity of life may object to calculating lives as mere numbers. Virtue ethics asks what a good person would do, focusing on qualities like courage, compassion and justice; many religious traditions align naturally with this approach because they emphasise character formation as well as rules. In the exam, demonstrating awareness of how these theories support or challenge religious positions will strengthen evaluation and show AO2-level analysis. Remember to link ethical theory to specific teachings and practical examples to make your points concrete.

## Exam technique
Answering exam questions well means combining clear knowledge with careful analysis and evaluation. For AO1 (knowledge and understanding), make sure you explain key beliefs, name relevant teachings or practices, and show how they form a coherent religious response. Use specific examples from the religion you study—teachings, scripture, or named practices—and avoid vague generalities. For AO2 (analysis and evaluation), consider different viewpoints, discuss strengths and weaknesses, and reach a reasoned judgement. When a question asks you to ‘evaluate’, present arguments for and against the statement, refer to religious teachings and ethical theory, and finish with a concise conclusion that weighs the evidence. Structure longer answers by planning a short introduction, developing distinct paragraphs for each point with clear links to belief or teaching, and ending with an evaluative conclusion. Time management is vital: spend the first few minutes planning, allocate time according to mark values, and leave a minute at the end to check spelling, punctuation and grammar. For SPaG marks, write clearly, use specialist terms such as ‘just war’, ‘pacifism’, ‘sanctity of life’, ‘jihad’ or ‘ahimsa’ correctly, and make sure sentences are complete. Practice past questions under timed conditions, learn a few strong examples and quotations you can adapt, and always show both knowledge and thoughtful evaluation to reach the higher mark bands.
