# The Five Pillars and Islamic Practices (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction: Islam as a lived religion in Britain and beyond
Islam is a global faith with a rich variety of beliefs and practices that shape the daily lives of Muslims. At GCSE level it is important to study both the core teachings that unite most Muslims and the ways in which practice can vary between communities, for example between Sunni and Shi’a Muslims, and within cultural contexts in Britain. The Five Pillars—Shahadah, Salah, Sawm, Zakah and Hajj—provide a clear framework for understanding the obligations that guide worship and community life. Around these pillars sit other practices and sources of authority: the Qur’an, the Hadith, the jurisprudence of Shari’ah, communal institutions such as the mosque, and devotional expressions like Sufism. Understanding how these elements interlink helps explain how belief becomes practice and how Islam shapes personal, social and ethical life.

## The Five Pillars: what they are and why they matter
The Five Pillars are often introduced as the essential acts that structure Muslim religious life. The Shahadah is the declaration of faith, Salah is formal prayer performed five times a day, Sawm is fasting in Ramadan, Zakah is a compulsory form of almsgiving, and Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca that every adult Muslim who can afford it and is physically able should undertake at least once. Each Pillar combines inward faith and outward action: Shahadah expresses theological commitment, Salah and Sawm cultivate discipline and remembrance of God, Zakah institutionalises social responsibility, and Hajj embodies unity and submission before God. Together they form a practical ethic: belief expressed through regular worship, community care, self-restraint and acts that remind Muslims of their place in the wider ummah (community).

## Shahadah, belief and differences between traditions
The Shahadah—“There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”—is the simple yet profound statement that marks the entry into Islam and expresses the monotheism (Tawhid) that lies at the heart of Muslim belief. For most Sunnis and Shi’a it is the foundational confession, but Shi’a Islam often adds a phrase acknowledging Ali as the wali (friend) of God, reflecting a different emphasis on authority and the role of the Prophet’s family. In practice, reciting the Shahadah sincerely in front of witnesses is the normal way to convert to Islam, while in daily life the Shahadah is affirmed in prayer and ritual. The Shahadah also frames other beliefs: the oneness of Allah (Tawhid), belief in prophets, scripture and the Day of Judgment. Teaching and exam answers should be careful to explain how the Shahadah connects theology to practice, for instance why a strong emphasis on Tawhid leads to strict rejection of idolatry (shirk) and an emphasis on worship focused on God alone.

## Salah: structure, ritual and spiritual meaning
Salah is the most visible practice in Muslim life. Performed five times a day at prescribed times, the prayers mark out the day and create a rhythm of worship. Salah requires ritual purity through wudu (ablution), facing the Ka’ba in Mecca, and a sequence of physical postures and Qur’anic recitation. Congregational prayer on Fridays (Jummah) has special communal importance and is often led by an imam. Sunni and Shi’a practices have differences in the number of rak’ahs (units) combined or how certain phrases are recited, and Shi’a Muslims commonly perform three distinct times of prayer with combined rak’ahs. In the classroom, it is useful to explain both the practical steps of Salah and its spiritual purpose: it disciplines the believer, creates continuous remembrance of God (dhikr), and embodies submission. A good exam answer will show knowledge of the ritual elements while also explaining how prayer shapes ethical life and community cohesion.

## Sawm, Ramadan and festival life
Fasting during the month of Ramadan is commanded in the Qur’an and remains one of the most formative practices for Muslims. Sawm involves abstaining from food, drink and sexual relations from dawn to sunset, but it also emphasises self-restraint, empathy for the poor and increased prayer, including special night prayers (taraweeh) and seeking Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Power, believed to be when the Qur’an began to be revealed. The end of Ramadan is celebrated with Id‑ul‑Fitr, a festival of communal prayer, charity and feasting. Id‑ul‑Adha, which commemorates Ibrahim’s willingness to submit to God, follows the Hajj season and includes sacrifice and distribution to the needy. Shi’a Islam also has distinct commemorations such as Ashura, which remembers the martyrdom of Husayn and carries deep communal and historical significance. When answering exam questions, linking the ethical and social outcomes of Sawm—such as increased compassion and solidarity—to the scriptural basis in the Qur’an (for example the verses on fasting) strengthens AO1 knowledge and AO2 evaluation.

## Zakah, Khums and Islamic approaches to social justice
Charitable giving institutionalises the idea that wealth carries moral duties. Zakah is the mandatory annual alms calculated on accumulated wealth and set items, intended to redistribute resources so that the most vulnerable are supported. Khums, more associated with Shi’a practice, requires one-fifth of certain items (often surplus income) to be given, historically to the Prophet’s family and community leaders and today often directed through scholars and community structures. Beyond these obligatory payments, sadaqah (voluntary charity) and waqf (endowments) play vital roles in Muslim welfare provision. Zakah and Khums are not only economic mechanisms: they express theological claims about stewardship and test the sincerity of faith by linking worship to social responsibility. Teaching examples can include modern Muslim charities and local projects that provide disaster relief, food banks and community development, demonstrating how classical rules are applied in contemporary Britain.

## Hajj, pilgrimage and the unity of the ummah
Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to Mecca required of those who are able. It involves a sequence of rites: entering a consecrated state (ihram), performing Tawaf (circumambulation of the Ka’ba), walking between Safa and Marwah, standing at Arafat, and symbolic acts such as the stoning of the pillars at Mina and the animal sacrifice at Id‑ul‑Adha. The rites recall the stories of Ibrahim and his family and symbolise submission, repentance and renewal. Umrah is a shorter, non‑obligatory pilgrimage that may be performed at any time. The experience of millions gathering from diverse cultures to perform the same rites powerfully expresses Islamic unity and equality before God, as all pilgrims wear simple garments and perform the same acts regardless of status. Hajj raises practical and ethical questions that are useful for evaluation in exams: access and inclusion, environmental and safety challenges, and the spiritual benefits claimed by pilgrims. A balanced answer will note both the obligations set out in scripture and the lived realities of modern pilgrimage.

## Exam technique
To score well on Edexcel GCSE questions about the Five Pillars and Islamic practices, combine clear factual knowledge (AO1) with analysis and evaluation (AO2). For short answer questions, give precise definitions and brief examples—define terms such as Tawhid, Shahadah, Zakah, and describe key practices like wudu or the Arafat standing concisely. For mid‑length questions, explain significance: do not only describe the ritual, but say why it matters to a Muslim personally and to the community. For extended “evaluate” questions aim to present more than one perspective. Start by explaining the religious teaching with reference to a relevant source (for Islam this can be a Qur’anic verse or a Hadith), then give strengths of the view, consider challenges or alternative interpretations (for example Sunni vs Shi’a practice or secular critiques), and end with a supported conclusion that weighs the arguments. Use specialist vocabulary accurately and watch SPaG—clear sentences and correct technical terms are rewarded. Time management is crucial: for a typical 50‑minute paper plan your answers, allocating more time to higher‑mark questions and leaving a couple of minutes to check spelling and to add any final evidence or a short concluding sentence that reinforces your judgement. Finally, wherever appropriate, bring in contemporary examples such as charities, local mosques, or public issues surrounding pilgrimage and dress; examiners value answers that show both textbook knowledge and an understanding of how religion is practised in the real world.
