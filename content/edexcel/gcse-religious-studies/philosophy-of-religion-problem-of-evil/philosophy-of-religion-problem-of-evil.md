# Philosophy of religion: problem of evil and arguments about God (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview
Philosophy of religion asks big questions about whether God exists and, if so, what God is like. Two of the most important ideas on the Edexcel specification are the problem of evil and the main arguments offered for God’s existence. The problem of evil challenges the idea of an all-powerful, all-knowing and all-loving God by asking how such a being could allow suffering. In response, theists (people who believe in God) and non-theists (people who do not) offer a range of philosophical, theological and practical answers. Alongside theodicies (attempts to justify God in the face of evil) are positive arguments for God’s existence such as the cosmological, teleological (design), moral and experiential arguments. Understanding both the questions and the replies is vital for clear, balanced exam answers.

## The problem of evil: what it is and why it matters
The problem of evil can be stated simply. If God is omnipotent (all-powerful), omnibenevolent (all-good) and omniscient (all-knowing), then why does suffering exist? The question has two main forms. The logical problem of evil claims that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with a God who has these three attributes; if God exists as classically defined, then evil should not. The evidential problem of evil is weaker: it accepts that God and evil might be compatible in principle, but argues that the amount, kind and distribution of suffering in the world make God’s existence unlikely. Students should be able to define moral evil as harm resulting from human choices (for example theft or violence) and natural evil as harm caused by natural events (for example earthquakes, disease and floods). Examples that often appear in teaching include wars, severe illness, natural disasters and historical atrocities; these highlight how powerful the ethical challenge is for believers.

## Classical theistic responses: the main theodicies
A theodicy is an attempt to show why evil and suffering might exist even if God does too. The Free Will Defence is one of the best-known replies. It argues that God gave humans free will because genuine love and moral responsibility require freedom. Some evil is the result of human misuse of that freedom; it is not caused by God but permitted so that people can make morally significant choices. This defence is often linked to Augustine and developed by later philosophers. It works well for moral evil but is weaker when explaining natural suffering that is not obviously the result of human choices.

The Soul-Making theodicy, associated with Irenaeus and later developed by modern philosophers, suggests that suffering can be a means of developing virtues such as courage, patience and compassion. In this view, a world with challenges is necessary for moral and spiritual growth; an immediately perfect world would offer no scope for character development. This approach helps explain why some suffering might be permitted but can seem insensitive when applied to extreme suffering and has to answer why seemingly pointless suffering exists.

Other responses include denying some classical attributes of God. Process theology, for example, suggests that God is not omnipotent in the classical sense and cannot unilaterally prevent all suffering; instead, God works persuasively within the processes of the world. Another option is sceptical theism, which argues that human beings have limited knowledge and cannot expect to see God’s reasons; what looks gratuitous to us may have reasons beyond our understanding. Finally, some theists appeal to mystery or the inscrutability of God, accepting that there are limits to human understanding when it comes to divine purposes. Each response has strengths and weaknesses and different religious traditions use different combinations of them.

## Arguments for the existence of God
Philosophy of religion also includes several classical positive arguments that aim to show that belief in God is reasonable. The cosmological argument starts from the existence of the universe and argues that there must be a first cause or necessary being that explains why anything exists at all. Thomas Aquinas formulated versions of this argument (the “First Cause” or “Unmoved Mover”) and some modern defenders use the Kalam cosmological argument, which focuses on the impossibility of an actual infinite series of past events and argues that the universe had a beginning and thus a cause.

The teleological or design argument draws attention to apparent order, purpose and complexity in nature. It claims that features such as the fine-tuning of physical constants, the complexity of biological systems and the regularity of natural laws are best explained by an intelligent designer rather than by blind chance. William Paley’s famous watch analogy is often used: finding a watch implies a watchmaker; in the same way the universe’s order implies a designer. Critics point to naturalistic explanations, including Darwinian evolution by natural selection, as alternative accounts.

The moral argument suggests that objective moral values exist and that the best explanation for such moral realism is a moral law-giver—God. Immanuel Kant and later thinkers argued in different ways that moral duties presuppose a just and moral order that culminates in God, though critics argue objective morality can be grounded in human reason, social contracts or evolutionary psychology without positing God.

Religious experience and miracles form a different kind of argument. Many people report personal experiences of the divine, conversions, visions or answered prayers; for believers these experiences are evidence for God. Miracles—events that seem to break natural laws—are also presented as signs of divine action, such as reported healings at Lourdes. Philosophers debate whether religious experiences and miracles provide reliable evidence, and whether memory, psychology and confirmation bias can explain them.

## Criticisms and counter-arguments
Each argument for God faces classical criticisms. The cosmological argument must handle the question “Who caused God?” and the problem of infinite regress. Supporters answer that God is a necessary being that by definition does not need a cause. Skeptics may accept a first cause but deny that it must be a theistic God. The design argument was given a major challenge by Darwin’s theory of evolution, which offers a natural mechanism for apparent design, and David Hume raised formal criticisms about inferring a designer from imperfect and disordered features of the world. The moral argument must show that objective moral duties cannot have other roots, and testimonies of religious experience are often judged suspect because experiences can be explained psychologically or sociologically.

When it comes to the problem of evil, criticisms of theistic responses are powerful. The Free Will Defence struggles to explain natural evil and gratuitous suffering. The soul-making approach faces the emotional objection that no amount of character growth justifies extreme suffering, especially of innocent children. Process theology invites questions about the nature and worth of a God who is not omnipotent. Sceptical theism prompts worries about moral paralysis: if God’s reasons are unknowable, we may never criticize unjust suffering or hold people accountable for evil in the way moral reasoning requires.

## Religious and comparative perspectives
Different religions approach the problem of evil and arguments about God in varied ways. Within Christianity, the Book of Job records a profound wrestling with undeserved suffering and offers no simple explanation, instead depicting faith that survives doubt. Catholic and Protestant theologies draw on Augustine’s free will theodicy and Irenaean soul-making, alongside pastoral care and sacramental resources. In Islam, suffering is often understood as a test from Allah and believers emphasize patience (sabr), trust and the idea of divine justice in the afterlife. Non-theistic traditions such as Buddhism interpret suffering (dukkha) as central to human life and offer a practical path (the Eightfold Path) for reducing suffering rather than arguing about a creator God. Recognising these differences helps students show awareness of how the problem of evil and arguments about God are handled in lived religion and in scripture, which is important for AO1 marks in exams.

## Weighing up the debate: can God and evil coexist?
Philosophers and theologians offer a spectrum of conclusions. Some argue that the sheer scale of suffering makes belief in an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God untenable; others hold that theodicies provide satisfactory explanations or at least permit rational belief. Students should practise balanced evaluation: showing understanding of the arguments, explaining the strongest replies, and assessing counter-arguments with reasons. A good GCSE answer recognises complexity, makes clear which objections are the most serious, and reaches a supported conclusion that may accept uncertainty. It is also valuable to show moral sensitivity when discussing real cases of suffering, because philosophical answers that seem abstract can appear inadequate in the face of human pain.

## Exam technique
Aim to structure your answers clearly and use religious examples and philosophical vocabulary to show understanding. For AO1 (knowledge and understanding) questions, define key terms such as omnipotence, omniscience, moral evil and natural evil, and explain arguments or beliefs in a clear paragraph. For AO2 (analysis and evaluation) show balanced reasoning: explain a point, give support (for example a biblical passage, a named philosopher or a theological idea), consider a challenge or weakness, and then evaluate its significance. For a mid-length question (about 12 marks) use two or three developed paragraphs, each making a point and responding to an objection. For a longer 16-mark evaluation include an introduction that defines terms, several balanced paragraphs that explain and criticise, and a short conclusion that weighs up the arguments. Use specialist terms correctly, and include brief references to scripture (for example Job, Psalms, or New Testament passages), named theodicies (free will, soul-making), and philosophers (Aquinas, Hume, Plantinga) where appropriate. Remember that 5% of the marks in extended questions are for Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPaG), so write clearly and proofread. Time yourself so you can complete all questions: practise planning answers under timed conditions using the PEEL or PEE structure (point, evidence/explain, example, link/conclude). Finally, remain respectful and reflective when discussing suffering; examiners reward answers that combine intellectual clarity with empathy and mature judgement.
