# Religion, Ethics and Families (marriage, contraception, divorce) (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction: why families and relationships matter in RS GCSE
Families, marriage and sexual ethics are central topics in Religious Studies because they bring together belief, moral reasoning and lived practice. Students are expected to know what different religions teach about the purpose of marriage and family life, how sexual relationships are understood and managed, and how communities respond to divorce, contraception and changing family forms in the 21st century. Learning this topic means you will explain religious teachings, compare beliefs within and between faiths, and evaluate moral arguments for or against particular positions. To do well you will need clear definitions, accurate religious examples, awareness of differing viewpoints and the ability to apply ethical ideas such as rights, duties and consequences to real-life situations.

## Marriage: purpose, sanctity and differing religious emphases
Religions often present marriage as more than a private arrangement: it is a social, spiritual and sometimes sacramental institution. In many Christian traditions marriage is viewed as a covenant or sacrament that unites two people and reflects the relationship between Christ and the Church; Christian scripture pictures marriage as a lifelong union and stresses fidelity and mutual support. Catholic teaching describes marriage as both unitive (the bond of love between spouses) and procreative (open to children), and the Mass and marriage rites underline its spiritual significance. In Islam marriage is also highly valued as a legal and moral contract that provides companionship, sexual fulfilment within marriage and the basis for family life; the Qur’an and the Prophet’s example emphasise responsibilities to spouse and children. Non-religious views, such as Humanism, tend to stress mutual respect and commitment rather than any sacramental meaning. Across religions there is diversity: some Protestant denominations are more flexible about the form of marriage and the relative emphasis on ritual, while others preserve traditional liturgies.

## Sexual relationships, contraception and family planning
Religious teachings vary strongly on sexual ethics and contraception. Many traditions teach that sexual activity is morally appropriate within marriage and that it serves emotional, unitive and procreative purposes. Catholic doctrine, as set out in key teaching documents, promotes natural family planning and opposes artificial contraception because it sees deliberate separation of the unitive and procreative aspects of sex as contrary to the nature of marriage. By contrast, most Protestant communities allow contraception as a responsible way to plan family size and protect health; their ethical reasoning commonly prioritises the couple’s conscience, welfare and practical responsibility. Muslim scholars show a range of views: some accept modern contraception when it is mutually agreed and does not permanently prevent procreation, while others express caution depending on the method and intention. Non-religious perspectives generally accept contraception as an important means of reproductive choice and public health. When discussing contraception in examination answers, show you understand the difference between artificial methods (condoms, the pill, implants) and natural methods (fertility awareness), and explain religious reasons for acceptance or rejection, for example concerns about preserving life, procreation, or responsible stewardship of family resources.

## Divorce, annulment and remarriage: theology, practice and pastoral responses
Attitudes to divorce and remarriage are a key area of difference within and between faiths. In Catholic teaching marriage is intended to be lifelong and indissoluble; civil divorce does not dissolve a sacramental marriage, and the Church may grant an annulment only when it determines that a valid marriage never existed for specific canonical reasons. This leads to distinctive pastoral and ethical issues: Catholics may oppose remarriage in church but often provide pastoral support to divorced people. Many Protestant denominations allow divorce and permit remarriage, often emphasising compassion, forgiveness and the pastoral care of individuals who have suffered breakdowns in marriage. In Islam divorce is permitted but regulated; there are clear legal and ethical procedures designed to protect rights and provide a period for reflection, reconciliation or settlement. Secular and non-religious approaches tend to treat divorce as a legal matter and may focus on the wellbeing of children and fairness between adults. In essays it is important to explain the theological reason for a faith’s stance (for example, sacred covenant, sanctity of marriage, protection of the vulnerable), describe how that stance is enacted in practice (annulment process, legal divorce, community support), and evaluate the effects on families and individuals.

## Family structures, roles and modern realities
Religion teaches about the purposes of family life—procreation, nurture, education, moral formation and social support—and also about the roles men and women should play. Scriptures and sacred texts are used to support different models: some traditions emphasise complementary roles for men and women, others stress equality and shared responsibility. Modern Britain contains a variety of family structures—nuclear families, single-parent households, blended families, same-sex parents and extended households—and religious communities respond in different ways. Some faith communities have clear doctrines about gender roles and household duties; others emphasise the equal dignity of men and women and work actively for gender equality. When you revise, be ready to describe different family types, explain how a particular religion might respond to each type, and assess religious teachings in light of contemporary social change. Consider how ethical principles such as justice, compassion and human dignity shape those responses. Use concrete examples: local parish family support groups, mosque-based counselling, or faith-based campaigns for family welfare all illustrate how doctrine connects to everyday reality.

## Comparison across religions and non-religious views — points to develop
A strong revision answer will compare and contrast religious teachings and include non-religious viewpoints. For example, when considering contraception, you might contrast the Catholic emphasis on natural methods and the procreative purpose of sex with many Protestant and secular positions that accept contraception for health and social reasons. When discussing divorce, contrast Catholic insistence on the permanence of marriage with more permissive Protestant approaches and Islamic legal procedures which allow divorce but set moral and social safeguards. Remember to explain internal diversity: within Christianity there are Catholic, Orthodox and many Protestant positions; within Islam there are Sunni and Shi’a approaches and further differences among scholars; non-religious perspectives also have variety from conservative social views to progressive humanist outlooks. Use scriptural and doctrinal examples to show how beliefs are grounded—quoting or referring to key passages or documents helps illustrate claims—and always note how practice and pastoral care can temper strict rules.

## Ethical tools and classroom examples to help your thinking
To explain and evaluate teachings, apply ethical concepts and theories that GCSE markers expect to see. Situation ethics argues that moral decisions should follow love and context rather than fixed rules; this approach can be used to justify contraception or divorce in certain circumstances. Natural law and deontological ethics emphasise following moral rules (for example, procreative purpose of sex), and are often reflected in Catholic teaching. Consequentialist thinking (weighing outcomes) supports arguments focused on wellbeing, children’s interests and social stability. Use short case studies in your revision: a young married couple deciding about contraception for health reasons; parents considering separation where domestic abuse is present; a same-sex couple seeking blessing from their local faith community. For each case, explain how different religious teachings might apply, what pastoral options exist, and how ethical approaches lead to different conclusions. This method shows depth of understanding and gives exam answers practical relevance.

## Exam technique
When you answer GCSE Religious Studies questions on families, relationships and sexual ethics, start by identifying the command word and plan your structure. For "Describe" and "Explain" questions, give clear definitions, state the relevant teaching, and develop your explanation with an example or scriptural reference. For 5–12 mark "Explain" items, include a source of authority where required. For "Evaluate" questions, present at least two contrasting viewpoints, use ethical reasoning or religious authority to support each side, and finish with a balanced, justified conclusion. Always show awareness of internal differences within a religion and, where useful, compare with another faith or a non-religious view. Use specialist terminology correctly (for example, sacrament, annulment, natural family planning, ummah), keep sentences focused and concise, and save time for a concluding paragraph that answers the question directly. Finally, practise past paper questions with timed responses, check you use accurate examples and teachings, and aim to include a short reasoned judgement in every evaluation to gain the higher marks.
