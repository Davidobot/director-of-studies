# The Qur’an, Hadith and Shariʿah as Authority in Islam (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction: Authority in Islam — what it means and why it matters
In Islam, authority is not a single thing but a network of sacred texts, teachings and interpretive practices that shape belief and action. At the centre is the Qur’an, regarded by Muslims as the literal word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Closely connected to the Qur’an is the Sunnah, the example of Muhammad’s words and actions, preserved mainly through Hadith literature. Together these provide the foundations for Shariʿah, the moral and legal framework that directs personal worship, family life, social relations and public ethics. Understanding how these sources operate — their origins, how they are interpreted, and how they interact — is essential for explaining why Muslims believe and behave as they do, and for evaluating the variety of responses within Muslim communities today.

## The Qur’an: revelation, compilation and continuing authority
The Qur’an occupies the highest authority in Islam. Muslims believe it is God’s revelation, revealed in Arabic to the Prophet Muhammad over approximately twenty-three years. Because it is considered the direct speech of God, its language, structure and message have a unique status: it is recited in prayers, memorised by millions, and used as the primary source for theology and law. The Qur’an was preserved orally by early Muslim communities and compiled in written form soon after the Prophet’s death. Scholars of tafsir (Qur’anic exegesis) explain verses by looking at historical context, linguistic meaning and how passages relate to one another. This process of interpretation matters because some passages are general guidance while others address specific situations; scholars debate whether some verses replace earlier ones (the principle of naskh, abrogation) and how to apply moral teachings to new circumstances. The Qur’an’s authority is also practical: its clear commandments (for example about prayer, fasting, zakah) guide daily worship, while its ethical teachings (justice, mercy, care for the poor) shape social attitudes.

## Hadith and Sunnah: recording the Prophet’s example
The Sunnah — the Prophet’s example — complements the Qur’an by showing how Muhammad put revelation into practice. The Hadith collections are reports that record what the Prophet said, did or approved. These reports include the text (matn) and the chain of transmission (isnad). Over time Muslim scholars developed rigorous methods to assess Hadith reliability, classifying them as sound (sahih), good (hasan) or weak (daʿif) depending on the trustworthiness of transmitters and consistency of the report. Collections such as Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are highly respected in many Sunni communities because of their strict authentication criteria; Shia Muslims rely more on collections that emphasise reports from the Prophet’s family and close supporters. Hadiths are crucial in providing practical details the Qur’an does not give, for example how to perform ablution (wudu), the exact words and postures of prayer, and the Prophet’s guidance on community matters. At the same time, the existence of weak or contradictory reports means that scholars must evaluate Hadiths carefully before using them as the basis for doctrine or law.

## Shariʿah and fiqh: from divine guidance to lived law
Shariʿah literally means “the way” and refers to God’s guidance for human life. It is not a single legal code but a set of objectives and rules derived from primary sources. Fiqh is the human understanding and application of Shariʿah — the body of jurisprudence developed by scholars. The classical Sunni sources for fiqh are the Qur’an and Sunnah (Hadith), together with consensus (ijmaʿ) of scholars and analogy (qiyas). Different Sunni legal schools (madhahib) — for example the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʿi and Hanbali schools — interpret texts and principles in varying ways, producing different legal opinions on matters such as inheritance, marriage and criminal punishment. In Shiʿa Islam the methodology includes the Qur’an, Hadith from the Prophet and the Imams, reason (‘aql) and juridical principles specific to Shiʿa jurisprudence. Modern scholars also appeal to the objectives of Shariʿah (maqasid), which focus on protecting religion, life, intellect, property and family, to guide contemporary rulings. This gives Shariʿah a flexible element: while core obligations are strongly fixed, the application to new technological or social problems often depends on juristic reasoning and context.

## How the sources work together — examples and tensions
The interaction between Qur’an, Hadith and Shariʿah can be seen in everyday religious practice and in contested legal or ethical questions. For ritual acts such as prayer and fasting the Qur’an sets the obligation while Hadith supplies detailed procedures. For issues like inheritance, the Qur’an gives precise shares, and jurists use Hadith and precedent to resolve ambiguities. Tensions arise when texts seem to conflict or when a Hadith graded weak appears to contradict clear Qur’anic principles. Scholars resolve such tensions by checking Hadith chains, preferring Qur’anic verses, using principles of interpretation or invoking higher aims of Shariʿah. Another source of tension is historical context: a ruling made in a particular place and time may not be appropriate today, so jurists weigh original intent, current conditions and ethical priorities. The result is not one fixed system but a living tradition in which interpretation and debate are part of how authority functions.

## Authority in everyday life: worship, law and identity
Authority from Qur’an and Hadith shapes both private devotion and public life. In worship, the Qur’an’s recitation is central to prayer and is itself an act of devotion; Hadith explains details such as the ritual washing and the order of the prayer. In family law, rules on marriage, divorce and inheritance often come from a combination of Qur’anic instruction and juristic interpretation, and these areas are where the practical impact of textual authority is most visible. Beyond ritual and law, the moral ethos of the texts influences social attitudes toward charity, justice and community cohesion. The role of scholars, imams and legal experts is therefore important: they interpret texts, issue guidance or fatwas, and lead communities. But authority is also lived through identity: memorising the Qur’an, observing festivals, and following the Prophet’s example are powerful ways Muslims express belonging across diverse cultures.

## Diversity and change: Sunni and Shiʿa perspectives and modern challenges
Islamic authority is not uniform. Sunni and Shiʿa traditions share core reverence for the Qur’an but differ in the weight given to particular Hadiths and the role of religious leadership. For example, Shiʿa Islam places great importance on the sayings of the Prophet’s family (Ahl al-Bayt) and on the guidance of Imams, while Sunni schools developed different canonical Hadith collections and juridical methods. Within Sunni Islam, multiple legal schools offer a range of interpretations. In the modern world additional diversity emerges from reformist movements, feminist critiques, human rights concerns and national legal systems that blend religious and secular law. These dynamics raise questions about how to apply Shariʿah in pluralistic societies, how to respond to modern ethical challenges, and how to balance respect for tradition with the need for change. Teaching this topic well means recognising the variety of legitimate views and the processes — historical, textual and ethical — by which Muslims arrive at them.

## Teaching and learning: key terms and approaches
When studying authority in Islam, it helps to be clear about key terms and the ways scholars analyse them. Core vocabulary includes Qur’an, Sunnah, Hadith, isnad (chain of transmission), matn (text of a report), fiqh (jurisprudence), Shariʿah and maqasid (objectives). Class activities that make these ideas concrete include comparing a Qur’anic verse with a related Hadith, examining how a legal ruling developed over time, or considering a modern ethical dilemma and how different scholars might address it. Encourage students to notice the difference between the divine text (Qur’an), human reports of the Prophet (Hadith) and scholarly reasoning (fiqh), and to explain why each element matters. Using case studies — for example, rules for prayer, the role of charity (zakah/sadaqah), or debates about family law — shows how authority operates in lived contexts.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on the Qur’an, Hadith and Shariʿah requires clear knowledge and careful evaluation. For AO1 (describe, explain, outline) questions, begin with a short definition of the key term, then give specific, accurate information and an example. For instance, when asked to explain the role of Hadith, define Hadith and describe how scholars authenticate reports, then give an example of a Hadith that affects worship (such as details of ablution or prayer). Use precise vocabulary — isnad, matn, tafsir, ijmaʿ, qiyas, maqasid — to show subject knowledge, and where appropriate name a respected Hadith collection or legal school. For AO2 (evaluate) questions, balance the answer: present arguments for the importance or reliability of a source, then present reasons why its authority might be questioned or limited, and finish with a justified conclusion. Typical evaluation points include the Qur’an’s centrality versus the human processes involved in Hadith transmission; the strengths of Shariʿah in offering comprehensive guidance versus challenges in interpreting texts for modern contexts; and diversity across Sunni and Shiʿa traditions. Use short quotations or specific examples to support points and always explain why they matter.

Organise longer answers into clear paragraphs: a brief introduction that sets out your plan, body paragraphs each dealing with one point and supported by evidence, and a short conclusion that answers the question directly. In evaluation questions aim to include at least two developed arguments for and against, and ensure your final judgement is supported by the evidence you have used. Remember exam technique details: manage your time so longer questions receive enough attention, use specialist terms correctly to gain AO1 marks, and check spelling, punctuation and grammar because these form part of the assessment. By combining accurate content, clear structure and careful evaluation students will show both knowledge and the ability to think critically about authority in Islam.
