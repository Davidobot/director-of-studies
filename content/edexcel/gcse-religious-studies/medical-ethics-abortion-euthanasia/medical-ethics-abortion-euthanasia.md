# Medical ethics: abortion, euthanasia and sanctity of life (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction: what the topic covers and why it matters
Medical ethics in the context of religion asks how beliefs about human life, suffering and moral duty shape responses to some of the most difficult choices people face. Abortion and euthanasia are practical questions about beginning and ending life; the idea of the sanctity of life is the key religious principle that underpins many responses. For GCSE Religious Studies you are expected to know what these terms mean, to explain how different religions and non-religious worldviews respond to them, and to evaluate the moral arguments and real-life implications. Understanding this topic helps you explain why people hold strong and sometimes conflicting views, and gives you examples and language to use in written exam answers.

## Sanctity of life and quality of life — two competing ideas
The phrase sanctity of life expresses the belief that human life is special and inherently valuable. In many religious traditions this is linked to ideas such as being made in the image of God, having a soul, or an intrinsic moral status that deserves protection. For example, Christian and Jewish teachings often appeal to the idea that life is sacred because it is a gift from God; Islamic teaching stresses the value God places on human life; many Hindus and Buddhists emphasise respect for life through concepts such as ahimsa (non‑harm) or karmic continuity. In contrast, the notion of quality of life focuses on the experiences that make life worth living: health, dignity, absence of unbearable pain, and the capacity for relationships and enjoyment. Medical ethics frequently requires weighing sanctity of life against quality of life, and different ethical systems and religious traditions will prioritise one over the other in different situations. Being able to explain this tension with examples — such as a severely disabled infant, a terminally ill patient in constant pain, or a pregnancy that threatens the mother’s life — is essential for answering exam questions.

## Abortion: definitions, arguments and religious perspectives
Abortion means deliberately ending a pregnancy. Debates hinge on when human life begins, the moral status of the foetus, and the rights and responsibilities of the pregnant woman. Pro‑life arguments stress the foetus’s right to life, often grounded in religious beliefs about human uniqueness and personhood. Pro‑choice arguments emphasise a woman’s bodily autonomy, the complexity of circumstances (such as rape, serious foetal abnormality or threat to the mother’s health), and the social consequences of forced continuation of pregnancy.

Religious responses vary. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that abortion is morally wrong because of the sanctity of life from conception and refers to official teaching in documents such as the Catechism; this makes Catholic teaching consistently pro‑life. Many other Christian denominations, while valuing life highly, recognise complex circumstances and may permit abortion in certain cases. Islam generally condemns abortion but some scholars allow it in limited circumstances before a point of ensoulment, and most schools permit it if the mother’s life is at risk. Judaism treats the life and well‑being of the mother as a priority in many situations through the principle of pikuach nefesh; this can lead to a more permissive approach when the mother’s health is endangered. Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist responses are diverse: all emphasise non‑harm, but interpretations about when life begins and the role of intention mean that individuals and communities reach different conclusions. Non‑religious positions such as humanism focus on human rights and may support legal access to abortion while arguing for personal and social support for women.

When you study abortion for the exam, be ready to explain key religious teachings and to use ethical concepts such as sanctity and quality of life, and to mention real‑world legal frameworks where relevant (for example how laws set time limits and conditions).

## Euthanasia and assisted dying: types, arguments and religious perspectives
Euthanasia refers to intentionally ending a life to relieve suffering. Assisted suicide (often called assisted dying) involves providing the means for a person to end their own life. Ethically we distinguish active euthanasia (deliberate action to cause death), passive euthanasia (withholding or withdrawing life‑sustaining treatment), voluntary euthanasia (at the patient’s request), non‑voluntary euthanasia (patient unable to consent) and involuntary euthanasia (against the patient’s wishes). These distinctions matter because different legal systems and moral frameworks treat them differently.

Arguments for legalising euthanasia often draw on compassion, respect for autonomy, and the relief of unbearable suffering. Supporters may point to countries where assisted dying is legal and regulated, arguing that safeguards can protect the vulnerable. Opponents raise concerns about the sanctity of life, the risk of abuse, the pressure vulnerable people could feel to end their lives, and the moral danger of normalising intentional killing.

Religious traditions tend to be cautious or opposed. The Catholic Church firmly opposes euthanasia, teaching that life must be preserved and that intentionally ending life is wrong, while acknowledging the moral difference between refusing disproportionate treatment and actively causing death, and supporting hospice care. Many other Christian groups also oppose active euthanasia but may accept passive decisions or palliative care. Islamic teaching generally forbids deliberate ending of life while supporting care and alleviation of suffering; many Muslim scholars differentiate between allowing natural death and causing death. Judaism largely opposes active euthanasia but allows withdrawal of extraordinary measures in some circumstances and places great weight on preserving life. Buddhism emphasises compassion and the moral importance of intention; because killing is generally wrong, euthanasia is usually rejected, but some Buddhists might accept difficult choices motivated by compassion. Sikhs and Hindus vary, and much depends on beliefs about karma and the soul’s journey. Non‑religious perspectives emphasise autonomy and relieving suffering, though some atheists also worry about safeguards and the social consequences.

In answers you should explain types of euthanasia, describe religious responses, and apply ethical reasoning, for example comparing the deontological emphasis on moral rules with consequentialist arguments about outcomes.

## Responses beyond prohibition: hospice care, palliative medicine and ethical practice
Religious and secular responses to abortion and euthanasia include practical care options. Many religious communities champion hospice and palliative care as a compassionate alternative to euthanasia. Catholic teaching, for instance, supports hospice work and pain relief while opposing intentional killing; similarly, many faith groups insist on supporting dying people and their families through medical, spiritual and psychological care. Palliative medicine aims to relieve pain and improve quality of life even when cure is not possible; it raises questions about the use of strong painkillers that may hasten death as a side effect, and whether this is ethically distinct from euthanasia. In the public debate, attention to support services, counselling, comprehensive reproductive health care and bereavement care is an important part of a balanced approach. For exam answers this is a useful way to show appreciation of nuance: demonstrating that religious opposition to euthanasia or abortion does not mean indifference to suffering, but often a strong commitment to compassionate care and prevention.

## Applying ethical theories: how different approaches reach different conclusions
To evaluate cases in exams you should be able to apply ethical theories. Natural law and some forms of deontology uphold absolute rules such as “do not kill” and support the sanctity of life, so they tend to oppose abortion and euthanasia. Situation ethics and consequentialism (for example utilitarianism) assess the morality of actions by their outcomes; these theories can support abortion or euthanasia in cases where overall suffering is reduced. Virtue ethics draws attention to character and what a virtuous person would do, focusing on compassion, courage and practical wisdom. Religious ethics often combine theological principles (sacred texts, teachings of religious leaders) with moral reasoning: for instance, a Christian using situation ethics might consider loving outcomes, while a Catholic relying on natural law would emphasise absolute moral norms. In your answers, show that you can explain the same moral problem from different theoretical standpoints and use specific examples to illustrate how each theory would reach its conclusion.

## Exam technique
When you answer questions on abortion, euthanasia and sanctity of life, start by carefully defining the key terms so the examiner knows you understand what is being asked. Use short paragraphs that name the religion or ethical theory you are discussing and include at least one teaching, scripture reference or named source for each religious view you cite. For evaluation questions follow a clear structure: state a claim or argument, explain it with supporting religious teaching or ethical reasoning, present the opposing view, weigh the strengths and weaknesses of each position, and finish with a short justified conclusion. When asked to “evaluate”, make sure you discuss more than one viewpoint and show critical judgement; avoid simply listing facts. Use religious vocabulary accurately (for example sanctity of life, pikuach nefesh, ahimsa, ensoulment, active/passive euthanasia) and aim for clear spelling, punctuation and grammar as this contributes to your marks. Finally, bring in real‑life examples and contemporary context where relevant — such as hospice care, assisted dying debates, or legal limits on abortion — to show application of belief to modern ethical issues.
