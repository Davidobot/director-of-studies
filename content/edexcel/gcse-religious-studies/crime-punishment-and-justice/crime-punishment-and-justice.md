# Crime, punishment and justice (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Key concepts and definitions
When studying crime, punishment and justice you need a clear grasp of the basic ideas. Crime is behaviour defined by the state as illegal; justice is the principle of fairness which governs how people are treated and how disputes are resolved. Punishment is the response given to those found guilty of criminal acts. Within punishment there are different aims: protection of the public, retribution (making the offender pay for wrongdoing), deterrence (discouraging others or the offender from repeating the crime) and reformation (helping the offender to change). Another important concept is restorative justice, which focuses on repairing harm between victim and offender rather than simply imposing a penalty. Human rights, fair trial, and the treatment of prisoners are also central: the law and many religious traditions insist that even criminals retain human dignity and basic rights.

## Why people commit crime and how societies respond
Criminologists and religious traditions offer different explanations for why people commit crime. Some causes are social: poverty, inequality, lack of education, broken homes or social exclusion can increase the risk of criminal behaviour. Psychological factors such as addiction or mental health problems are also relevant, and some philosophers point to moral failure or a breakdown in personal responsibility. Societies respond through law, policing, courts and punishment, but responses vary. Some governments prioritise tough sentences and incapacitation; others emphasise rehabilitation, community sentences and restorative programmes. Religious organisations often work alongside the state: churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and faith-based charities run mentoring, counselling and prison chaplaincy services that aim to address causes of crime and support offenders to reintegrate.

## Aims of punishment: practical and ethical considerations
Exam questions often ask you to explain and evaluate the aims of punishment. Protection is concerned with preventing further harm by removing dangerous people from society. Retribution is rooted in the idea of moral balance: a wrongdoer should suffer proportionately. Deterrence hopes that the threat of punishment will reduce crime. Reformation aims to change offenders’ behaviour, through education, therapy or religious guidance, so they do not re-offend. Each aim has strengths and weaknesses. Protection keeps people safe but can produce overcrowded prisons. Retribution may satisfy victims’ need for justice but can look like vengeance. Deterrence works better for some crimes than others and relies on the assumption that everyone acts rationally. Reformation aligns with ideas of forgiveness and human dignity but requires resources and long-term commitment. When you evaluate, consider practical evidence, moral arguments and how different aims suit different types of crime.

## Treatment of criminals and human rights
How criminals are treated is a test of a society’s justice. Many religions teach that offenders should be treated with compassion even while they face consequences. Standards such as a fair trial and protection from torture are non-negotiable in international law and in most religious ethics. For example, Christian teaching about justice and mercy encourages safe custody and humane treatment alongside accountability. Islam contains guidance about punishment in the Qur’an and prophetic teachings, but also emphasises mercy and due process. Jewish law stresses due procedure and the value of life. Buddhists and Hindus emphasise compassion and rehabilitation, and Sikhism teaches both justice and care for the vulnerable. In practice, debates arise over the use of torture, indefinite detention, solitary confinement and prison conditions. Ethical theories inform these debates: utilitarianism might justify harsh measures if they produce greater safety, while rights-based approaches and many religious teachings oppose actions that violate human dignity.

## Forgiveness, repentance and restorative justice
Forgiveness and repentance are central to many religious responses to crime. In Christianity, teachings about forgiveness and mercy encourage reconciliation and restoration, and Christian groups often support restorative justice schemes that bring offender and victim together to repair harm. Islam also highlights forgiveness as virtuous alongside the need for justice; there are traditions of mediation and compensation. Judaism places value on teshuvah—repentance—and community processes that aim to restore relationships. Restorative justice reflects these religious insights: it gives victims voice, asks offenders to take responsibility, and seeks practical repair such as apologies or reparation. Evidence from restorative programmes suggests reduced re-offending in some contexts and greater satisfaction for victims, though restorative approaches may not suit every crime or every victim. When writing about restorative justice in exams, show understanding of both the moral appeal and the practical limits.

## The death penalty and capital punishment
The death penalty is one of the most contested topics in crime and punishment. Some argue it is a proportionate retribution for murder and a strong deterrent; others reject it as irreversible, discriminatory in practice and morally wrong. Religious traditions vary. Many Christian denominations have moved towards opposition to capital punishment, emphasising the sanctity of life and possibilities for repentance; certain biblical passages have been interpreted both to support and to oppose capital punishment. Catholic teaching in recent decades has developed a strong presumption against the death penalty. Islamic law contains capital punishments in some interpretations, but Muslim scholars differ in emphasis and application, and mercy and clemency are important Islamic values. Judaism has texts that allow capital penalties but modern Jewish movements and most democratic states with Jewish communities oppose executing offenders in practice. Buddhists and Hindus typically oppose taking life, leading many adherents to reject capital punishment. In essays, balance religious arguments with practical concerns: risk of wrongful conviction, unequal application, and modern human rights standards.

## Religious teachings and examples from different faiths
Every religion studied on the Edexcel course has specific teachings relevant to crime and punishment, and you should be able to explain key beliefs and compare them. Christianity emphasises justice and mercy, drawing on scriptures such as the Parable of the Sheep and Goats to underline responsibility to the victim and the needy, while also teaching forgiveness. Catholic Social Teaching connects concern for victims with the duty to reform offenders and support rehabilitation. Islam teaches justice and fairness in legal dealings and contains guidance on punishment in the Qur’an and Hadith; compassion and the option of forgiveness are strongly present alongside retributive rules in classical law. Judaism emphasises the sanctity of life and proper legal procedure, with mercy and repentance central to communal life. Buddhism focuses on the ethical consequences of actions (kamma) and stresses compassion, rehabilitation and non-harm. Hinduism teaches dharma (duty) and the moral consequences of actions across lifetimes, supporting both accountability and compassionate responses. Sikhism combines an insistence on justice with the duty to serve and reform, exemplified in community efforts to support prisoners and their families. Use concrete examples in answers: faith-based prison charities, chaplaincy work, restorative justice projects, and public debates about capital punishment.

## Contemporary issues and ethical challenges
Modern criminal justice faces complex ethical challenges that cross faith and secular lines. Issues include whether torture can ever be justified to save lives, the morality and effectiveness of life imprisonment without parole, the impact of social inequality on imprisonment rates, and the question of whether punishment should aim primarily to deter or to heal. Ethical theories often appear in exam questions: situation ethics may justify unusual actions if they produce the most loving outcome; utilitarianism weighs consequences such as reduced future harm; virtue ethics asks what a good character would do. Religious responses are sometimes flexible and diverse within traditions—there is rarely a single view. When answering, show awareness of competing arguments, give examples, and explain why some approaches are persuasive or flawed.

## Exam technique
When you answer exam questions on crime, punishment and justice you must show both accurate knowledge (AO1) and evaluation (AO2). For AO1 begin by defining key terms and giving clear, factual points. Use specific religious teachings, scriptural references or named ideas where appropriate to show detailed knowledge. For AO2 build balanced arguments: explain strengths and weaknesses of an approach, consider different religious and non-religious perspectives, and include practical examples such as restorative justice schemes, prison charities, or high-profile debates about the death penalty. For 'explain' questions aim to develop points with reasons and examples; for 'evaluate' questions you must include more than one view and reach a supported judgement. Plan short introductions to set the focus, and finish with a brief conclusion that answers the question directly. Remember SPaG: write clearly, use specialist terminology such as deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation and restorative justice, and check spelling and grammar where you can. Time management is crucial: spend longer on the 12–15 mark evaluation questions, structure your response into paragraphs, and use evidence and examples to lift your marks.
