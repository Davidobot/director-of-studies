# Marriage, family and sexual ethics (GCSE Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview of the topic
Marriage, the family and sexual ethics is an important strand of the Pearson Edexcel GCSE Religious Studies specification under Area of Study 1: Religion and Ethics. This topic asks you to explore why religions value marriage and family life, how different faiths understand sexual relationships, and the moral questions that arise in modern society — for example cohabitation, contraception, same-sex relationships, divorce and remarriage, and gender equality. For each religion you study you must be able to describe key teachings, explain how these are rooted in scriptures and tradition, and evaluate how believers respond to contemporary challenges. The specification asks that students show awareness of internal diversity (different Christian denominations, Sunni and Shi’a Islam, Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, different Hindu, Jewish and Sikh perspectives) and of non-religious viewpoints such as Humanism and atheism.

## Key concepts and specialist vocabulary
Understanding this topic depends on a few recurring concepts. Marriage is usually presented as a permanent, public commitment between partners, often with religious significance; it can be described as unitive (bringing partners together) and procreative (open to having children). The family is the social unit that typically provides security, education and care for children. Sexual ethics covers beliefs about what kinds of sexual behaviour are morally acceptable and why. You will often be asked to refer to sources of authority: sacred texts (Bible, Qur’an, Guru Granth Sahib, Vedas), key teachings (such as the Ten Commandments, the Five Pillars, the Noble Eightfold Path), and authoritative documents or leaders (for example Catholic teaching such as Humanae Vitae or documents by modern popes). Ethical theories such as situation ethics, utilitarianism and virtue ethics are used in the specification to show how different approaches might support or challenge particular religious teachings.

## Marriage across the religions
Most religions consider marriage important but understand its nature and purpose differently. In Catholic Christianity marriage is a sacrament: a sacred, indissoluble covenant reflecting Christ’s union with the Church; the Catechism and papal teaching emphasise marriage’s unitive and procreative purposes. Wider Christianity shares the view that marriage is significant, but Protestant denominations vary: some prioritise covenant and companionship and are more accepting of remarriage and cohabitation. In Islam marriage (nikah) is regarded as a contract and a means to fulfil physical, emotional and social needs; Qur’anic passages and Hadith describe mutual rights and responsibilities and stress family stability. Hinduism values marriage as a key duty of the householder stage (grihastha), often celebrated with elaborate rituals and understood in terms of dharma (duty). Judaism treats marriage as a mitzvah: a commanded good, with rituals such as the ketubah and ceremonies that establish family life. Sikhism emphasises the partnership of marriage, with the Lavan hymns framing marriage as a spiritual and social union. Buddhism does not prioritise marriage as a religious sacrament; marriage is a social institution and, while monks or nuns may take vows of celibacy, lay Buddhists view family life positively if it supports ethical living and the raising of children.

When you discuss marriage in essays, show how each religion supports the institution with scriptural or traditional sources and then explain common modern responses — for example increased cohabitation, legal recognition of same-sex marriages (which many religions and denominations respond to differently), and how religious communities balance tradition and pastoral care.

## Sexual relationships and contraception
Religious teachings about sex tend to link sexual activity with morality, the purposes of marriage, and social responsibility. Catholic teaching stresses that sexual activity has two inseparable meanings: the unitive bond between spouses and openness to procreation; therefore artificial contraception is rejected while natural family planning is permitted and promoted. Many Protestant churches are more permissive about contraception, often accepting artificial methods as responsible stewardship of family life. Islam promotes sexual relations within marriage and has a range of views on contraception: some jurists permit methods that do not cause harm, while others emphasise different limits; the concept of maslahat (public interest) and contextual ethical reasoning can influence decisions. In Judaism contraception is discussed in rabbinic law with differing opinions across Orthodox, Conservative and Reform communities. Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist perspectives tend to focus on sexual behaviour being responsible and non-harmful; views on contraception are diverse and often shaped by cultural practices and the emphasis on ahimsa (non-harm), duty and compassion.

Same-sex sexual relationships are a key contemporary issue. The specification requires you to know that many traditional teachings (for example in Catholicism and some strands of Islam) do not accept same-sex sexual activity, while other denominations, communities and non-religious perspectives support acceptance and equal marriage. Knowing specific scriptural references or official teachings and explaining how different groups interpret or re-interpret them is essential.

## Family life, gender roles and equality
Religions articulate purposes for the family such as procreation, security, religious education and mutual support. Catholics refer to family teachings including Familiaris Consortio and local parish support such as catechesis and pastoral care. Christians often refer to Ephesians and other New Testament instructions about family duties; Judaism emphasises the home as a place of religious life, with rituals and laws that support family continuity. Islam sees the family as the foundation of the ummah and prescribes mutual rights; the Qur’an and Hadith inform responsibilities towards children and spouses. Hinduism frames family duties within varnashrama dharma and Purusharthas (dharma, artha, kama, moksha), while Sikhism stresses equality and sewa within the family. Buddhism discusses household duties through the Sigalovada Sutta and encourages ethical family life.

Gender equality and roles are important sub-topics. Some religious texts have been read in ways that suggest distinct roles for men and women, while other interpretations stress equality and equal dignity. For example, many Christians and Sikhs emphasise the equality of men and women in principle, but practices and leadership roles vary between traditions. Jewish law and rabbinic literature, Hindu smriti and historical practices show variation, and contemporary religious communities often debate change. The specification expects you to explain both the traditional teachings and the modern movements or documents that oppose gender prejudice, such as Catholic statements about dignity at work in the home, Sikh examples of women in leadership, and Buddhist support for gender equality in some traditions.

## Divorce, remarriage and family planning
Different faiths treat divorce and remarriage with varying tolerance. Catholicism views marriage as indissoluble and permits annulment in particular canonical cases but generally discourages divorce and remarriage. Many Protestant churches are more accepting of divorce and permit remarriage, often emphasising pastoral support and the possibility of forgiveness. In Islam divorce is allowed and regulated, with rules about talaq and procedures that differ between Sunni and Shi’a practice; remarriage is permitted after prescribed procedures. Judaism allows divorce through the get, though attitudes and procedures vary by movement. Buddhism, Hinduism and Sikhism approach divorce with compassion and practical concern for the welfare of those involved, with differences in how communities respond.

Family planning raises ethical questions about when and whether to use contraception, how to regulate birth, and how teachings influence decisions in modern life. Catholic teaching opposes artificial contraception but promotes natural family planning; other religions may allow contraception under many circumstances, often using ethical reasoning about health, welfare and intention. The specification asks you to be able to present divergent views, consider non-religious perspectives (for example Humanist arguments for reproductive choice), and apply ethical theories such as situation ethics to explain why some religious adherents might take flexible positions.

## Classroom examples and how to use sources
When revising or teaching, use specific examples and sources. For Christianity you can refer to Mark 10:6–9 on marriage, Ephesians 5 on family roles, and the varying responses from Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. For Islam use Surah 4 and Surah 24 for teachings on marriage and modesty, plus hadith material for practical rulings. For Judaism refer to Genesis and Deuteronomy for covenantal and family laws, and rabbinic sources on family purity and obligations. Hindu sources include the Rig Veda and the Bhagavad Gita for duties and stages of life. Sikh references include the Lavan and Guru Granth Sahib hymns on marriage and equality. For Buddhism the Sigalovada Sutta and the Five Precepts provide ethical guidance about household life. Always show how believers use scripture and tradition to support positions and how interpretations can differ.

Use contemporary examples when you can: parish family support groups, mosque parenting classes, langar in gurdwaras as community support, Buddhist sangha outreach, Hindu community charities providing family services, and secular organisations like Humanist associations. These make answers grounded and show understanding of religion in the modern world.

## Exam technique
In questions about marriage, family and sexual ethics, first make sure you answer exactly what is asked: “State” requires a short factual answer; “Describe” asks for more detail about beliefs or practices; “Explain” needs reasons and reference to beliefs or sources; “Evaluate” requires analysis of differing viewpoints, use of evidence, and a justified conclusion. When explaining or evaluating, always include religious sources or teachings (scripture, sacred text references, official documents or statements) and show awareness of internal diversity — for example contrasting Catholic teaching with Protestant or non-religious views. In evaluation questions aim to present at least two perspectives, apply an ethical framework or contemporary example, and give a clear, reasoned conclusion. Keep technical terminology correct (e.g. “unitive”, “procreative”, “annulment”, “nikah”, “sunnah”, “ahimsa”) and watch your spelling, punctuation and grammar: these are explicitly assessed. Practise writing balanced paragraphs that link belief to practice and then to contemporary application; this structure—point, evidence, explanation, link—works well in exams.
