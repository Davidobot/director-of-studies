# Electoral systems and referendums (A-level Politics Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: why systems matter
Electoral systems and referendums shape the way politics works in the UK. The method used to convert votes into seats determines which parties win power, how accountable representatives are, whether minority views gain a voice, and whether governments are stable. Referendums allow a direct decision by the electorate on a single question and have become an increasingly important tool for constitutional and political change. Understanding the procedures, strengths and weaknesses of different electoral systems, and the uses and limits of referendums, is crucial to explaining patterns of party success, voter behaviour and the constitutional choices made since the late 1990s.

## Types of electoral systems used in the UK and how they operate
The UK uses a variety of systems across different levels of government. First-past-the-post (FPTP) is used for UK general elections; it is a simple plurality system in single-member constituencies where the candidate with the most votes wins. The Additional Member System (AMS) combines single-member constituency elections with a regional list to add a degree of proportionality; it is used for the Scottish Parliament and was used for the National Assembly for Wales (now Senedd). The Single Transferable Vote (STV) is used in Northern Ireland Assembly elections and some local elections; it has multi-member constituencies in which voters rank candidates and votes are transferred according to preferences to meet a quota. The Supplementary Vote (SV) was a majoritarian system in which voters expressed a first and second preference and the top two candidates faced a redistribution of second preferences if no one secured over 50 per cent; the use of SV for certain mayoral and police and crime commissioner contests was changed by legislation in 2022.

Each system shapes the ballot in a different way. FPTP emphasises the personal link between one MP and a constituency, AMS blends constituency link with proportional 'top-up' seats, STV gives voters fine-grained choice among candidates and parties within a multi-member area, and majoritarian systems like SV create an element of majority endorsement for single-office positions. The technical details – quotas, thresholds, list allocation formulas and transfer rules – matter because they determine how evenly votes translate into seats.

## Advantages, disadvantages and classroom examples
FPTP is easy to understand and tends to produce single-party governments capable of decisive action. It creates clear accountability: one government, one manifesto to judge at the next election. However, it produces distortions: many votes can be effectively wasted, smaller parties and regionally concentrated challengers can be either over- or under-represented, and large numbers of safe seats reduce electoral competitiveness. The 2015 general election is often used to illustrate distortionary effects: parties with broadly similar national vote shares ended up with very different seat totals, while regionally concentrated parties such as the Scottish National Party converted concentrated support into a disproportionate number of Westminster seats.

Proportional systems such as AMS and STV generally deliver fairer representation of parties and reduce wasted votes. They can increase turnout among supporters of smaller parties and encourage consensus politics, but they also tend to produce coalition or minority governments and require compromise. AMS preserves constituency representation while adding proportional balance, but critics point to the creation of two types of representative (constituency and list members). STV maximises voter choice among individual candidates and tends to weaken strict party control, but the counting process is more complex and multi-member districts can enlarge the territory an individual representative serves.

SV was defended as simple for voters and able to produce broadly majoritarian winners for high-profile single posts such as mayors. Critics argued it limited genuine second-preference choices and still left room for tactical strategies. The legal change in 2022 altering the use of SV for some offices underlines that electoral rules are politically contested and can be reformed by statute.

## Impact on parties, governments and voter behaviour
Electoral systems influence the party system and the type of government produced. FPTP fosters a tendency to two-party dominance at the national level, encourages concentrated regional parties, and can reward concentrated regional support with outsized parliamentary representation. Under FPTP, parties target marginal seats and often see large variations between national vote share and parliamentary seats. Proportional systems encourage multi-party competition, increase the viability of smaller parties, and make coalition or minority government more likely, as in the Scottish and Welsh contexts. Where PR-like systems are used, parties sometimes tailor appeals to coalition prospects, and voters may feel freer to support smaller parties without the fear of wasting a vote.

Voter behaviour responds to incentives. Tactical voting is common under FPTP when electors support a less-preferred candidate to defeat a worse-placed rival. Under STV and AMS, voters can express preferences for smaller parties with more confidence that their votes will count. The nature of the link between representative and voter also shifts: constituency MPs under FPTP often emphasise local casework, while list or multi-member systems can dilute a single named representative but broaden representation across party and identity lines.

## Referendums in the UK: history, types and effects
Since 1997 the UK has seen a series of high-profile referendums that have reshaped constitutional arrangements and public policy. Devolution referendums in 1997 and 1998 paved the way for the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the Senedd and the Northern Ireland Assembly. The 2011 referendum on adopting the Alternative Vote was decisive in rejecting AV. The 2014 Scottish independence referendum was a constitutional moment, producing a high turnout and a majority for the United Kingdom to remain. The 2016 referendum on membership of the European Union led to a narrow majority for Leave and triggered profound constitutional, political and legal consequences, including renewed debates over parliamentary sovereignty and the role of popular decisions in representative systems.

Referendums can be binding or advisory; in the UK they have usually been legally binding where the enabling legislation specified it, but they are always embedded within a parliamentary framework. The wording of the question, the threshold for turnout or majority, and whether a referendum is consultative or requires implementing legislation all shape its political effect. High turnout and decisive majorities confer stronger political mandates; narrow results or low turnout make the interpretation more contestable.

## Arguments for and against referendums and system choice
Proponents argue that referendums increase democratic legitimacy, enfranchise citizens directly on constitutional matters, and provide a clear mandate when ordinary political processes are seen as inadequate. They can resolve major questions that cut across party lines, create civic engagement and settle contested issues. Electoral system reform via referendums is sometimes presented as the only way to secure a durable change to the rules of the political game.

Critics counter that referendums risk oversimplifying complex issues, empowering majoritarian outcomes that harm minority rights, and transferring detailed policy choices to campaigns where information is uneven and emotive appeals can dominate. Referendums can weaken representative institutions if they are used as substitutes for deliberative parliamentary debate. When they produce close or contested outcomes, they can deepen polarisation rather than resolve it, as many commentators argued in the wake of the 2016 EU referendum.

When choosing an electoral system, there is no single correct answer; trade-offs are unavoidable. If political stability and decisive government are the priority, systems that favour single-party majorities have advantages. If fairness, diversity of representation and proportionality are central, PR-based systems perform better. Teaching this topic involves weighing criteria such as proportionality, simplicity, accountability, stability, voter choice, and the quality of representation, and illustrating each criterion with contemporary UK examples.

## Evaluating systems: practical classroom approaches
In classroom practice, comparing systems using practical metrics helps students make reasoned judgements. Encourage students to judge a system against criteria: how closely do seat shares reflect votes, how simple is the ballot and counting process, how strong is the representative–constituent link, what incentives does the system create for party behaviour, and what are the likely effects on turnout and political engagement? Use comparative examples: Westminster general elections under FPTP, devolved elections under AMS and STV, and high-profile referendums. Case study work that tracks a particular election or referendum—showing manifestos, campaign strategies, turnout patterns and media influence—helps consolidate understanding of how systems interact with political behaviour.

A useful exercise is to ask students to argue for a system based on a given priority (for example, fairness, stability, or local accountability), and then to respond to counter-arguments. Another productive classroom activity is to simulate different electoral formulas on the same dataset to show how outcomes change when the counting rules change; this makes the effects of proportionality and wasted votes tangible.

## Exam technique
When approaching exam questions on electoral systems and referendums, start by defining key terms clearly and precisely so that the examiner knows you understand the system or concept you will analyse. For short or source-based questions, engage directly with the source: summarise its main claims, evaluate its perspective or limitations and bring in your own knowledge to support or challenge it. For extended essays, use a clear structure of introduction, development and conclusion: define the issue, set out criteria for judgement, provide detailed explanation and case-study evidence, apply analysis that links cause and effect, and end with a balanced conclusion that answers the question. Always aim to show AO1 knowledge (accurate description and definitions), AO2 analysis (explain how and why systems produce particular effects, using examples) and AO3 evaluation (weigh up competing arguments and reach a reasoned judgement).

In longer responses, integrate examples such as the 1997 devolution referendums, the 2011 AV referendum, the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and the 2016 EU referendum, and contrast devolved elections under AMS and STV with Westminster contests under FPTP. When comparing systems, explicitly assess trade-offs rather than just listing pros and cons. Time yourself in mocks so that you can allocate appropriate minutes to 12-, 24- and 30-mark questions. For 30-mark essays, aim to spend about ten minutes planning, 60–70 minutes writing and a few minutes reviewing; ensure each paragraph advances the argument and ties back to the criteria set out in your introduction. Finally, use evaluative language throughout and end with a concise judgement that synthesises your analysis—this demonstrates evaluative maturity required at A-level.
