# Parliament: roles and the legislative process (A-level Politics Pearson Edexcel)

## What Parliament is for: core roles explained
Parliament is the UK’s primary political forum: it makes the laws, holds the government to account, represents the electorate and gives legitimacy to public policy. These core roles overlap in practice. Legislation is the most visible function: Acts of Parliament create and change the legal framework for society. Scrutiny is the practical counterweight to legislation; through questions, debates and committee inquiries MPs and peers examine government decisions, probe the evidence behind policy and force ministers to explain and justify their choices. Representation connects Parliament to voters: backbench MPs bring constituency concerns to the floor of the Commons, while parties and interest groups use parliamentary mechanisms to press their cases. Finally, Parliament legitimises government action by authorising finance and by providing the mandate through which an elected executive claims to govern. Understanding these roles helps explain tensions within the system: why the Commons often defers to a majority government, why the Lords act as a revising chamber, and why reform debates repeatedly return to questions of sovereignty, accountability and democratic legitimacy.

## The two Houses: composition and comparative powers
Parliament is bicameral, made up of the elected House of Commons and the unelected House of Lords, with the monarch as the formal head of state. Members of the Commons are directly elected MPs, and the Commons alone has the exclusive constitutional powers to determine supply — the approval of taxation and public spending — and to form and dismiss governments through confidence procedures. The House of Lords is composed of life peers, a small number of hereditary peers and appointed bishops; it is not a co‑equal chamber in practice. The Lords’ principal role is to revise and delay rather than to block the will of the Commons. This practical balance is reinforced by conventions and statute. The Salisbury Convention, for example, limits the Lords’ resistance to measures promised in a government’s election manifesto, while the Parliament Acts (1911 and 1949) allow the Commons to bypass the Lords in specified circumstances, especially where a bill is repeatedly delayed. Money bills enjoy particular protection: the Lords can only delay them for a short period. That constitutional architecture shapes how legislation is negotiated and how governments approach parliamentary majorities.

## How a bill becomes law: stages and the actors involved
The legislative process starts long before a bill is introduced. Governments usually consult via Green Papers and White Papers, but individual MPs can also initiate bills. A bill then progresses through a sequence of stages in both Houses: the First Reading (formal introduction), Second Reading (principled debate), Committee Stage (line-by-line scrutiny), Report Stage (further amendment), and Third Reading (final consideration). If a bill emerges from one House amended, it moves to the other for the same sequence and the two Houses may enter “consideration” and “ping‑pong” to resolve differences. If the Lords persistently reject a Commons bill, the Parliament Acts provide a route for the Commons to secure Royal Assent without Lords’ consent, subject to timing rules. Once both Houses agree, the bill receives Royal Assent and becomes an Act of Parliament. Different types of bills follow the same broad pattern but with important variations: public bills affect the general law, private members’ bills provide MPs not in government an opportunity to legislate (and have led to significant measures such as the Abortion Act 1967), private bills affect specific organisations and hybrid bills combine features of both. Delegated or secondary legislation allows ministers to make detailed rules under powers granted by primary Acts; these statutory instruments are subject to less parliamentary time and are scrutinised instead through committee procedures and resolution mechanisms (affirmative or negative), which is why delegated powers are a frequent focus of constitutional critique.

## Committees, backbenchers and the mechanics of scrutiny
Parliamentary scrutiny relies heavily on committees and on the agency of backbenchers. Select committees in the Commons are permanent bodies that investigate government departments, call ministers and officials to give evidence and publish reports with recommendations; the Public Accounts Committee is a prominent example that examines value for money in public spending. Committees provide expertise, sustained inquiry and a public record that can embarrass government and shape policy. Public bill committees (formerly standing committees) examine the detail of proposed legislation and invite amendments that can alter the shape of law before it reaches the floor. Backbenchers have acquired more formal methods to exert influence, such as the Backbench Business Committee which secures parliamentary time for non-government business. Time and agenda are crucial resources: the government controls much of the parliamentary timetable through programme motions and the usual channels, and a government majority usually determines legislative outcomes. But when the executive’s majority is small or absent, backbench rebellions, coalition arrangements or confidence-and-supply agreements can significantly constrain government plans; the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition of 2010–2015 and the minority arrangements after the 2017 election are modern examples of how Parliament’s composition affects scrutiny and legislation.

## The House of Lords as revising chamber and the reform debate
The Lords is often described as a revising chamber: its members bring specialist knowledge, longer tenures and a relative insulation from electoral pressure, all of which can focus attention on policy detail. Lords amendments frequently lead to improved drafting, legal clarity and added safeguards, and peers play a central role in scrutinising secondary legislation through committees such as the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. Yet the unelected nature of the Lords raises persistent questions about democratic legitimacy, accountability and patronage. Reforms since 1997 removed the bulk of hereditary peers and created the Supreme Court, but arguments for further change – from a wholly elected second chamber to a reconfigured appointed chamber – recur in political debate. The exercise of Lords’ powers is also constrained by conventions like Salisbury, and by practical realities: where the Commons insists, the Lords normally yield. The balance between expertise and legitimacy lies at the heart of the Lords’ continuing role in the legislative process.

## Parliament, the constitution and the changing location of sovereignty
Parliament sits at the centre of the UK constitution, which is uncodified and built from statute, common law, conventions and authoritative works. Parliamentary sovereignty remains the fundamental legal principle: Parliament can legislate on any subject and cannot bind future Parliaments. However, recent decades have complicated where sovereignty appears to lie in practice. Devolution, membership of international organisations, and the Human Rights Act 1998 have introduced competing loci of authority. The EU era introduced a clear and practical constraint on Parliamentary law-making, and the Brexit process underlined Parliament’s role in reclaiming and reasserting legal primacy while also exposing tensions about who should make final decisions. The Supreme Court’s role in judicial review and in defining the limits of executive action, together with statutory devices such as the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (2011) and its later repeal, illustrate how constitutional instruments can be reshaped by politics. Debates continue about codifying the constitution, entrenching rights in a bill of rights, or reforming parliamentary structures; these discussions depend on trade-offs between flexibility, clarity and the protection of rights against transient majorities.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions about Parliament and the legislative process, structure and precision are your strongest tools. Begin with a concise introduction that defines the key terms and frames which role or process you will analyse. For knowledge (AO1) ensure your description of the legislative stages, the composition of the Commons and Lords, and the privileged powers (finance, confidence) is accurate and clearly presented. When analysing political information or a source (AO2), bring the source into a wider context: show how the evidence relates to parliamentary functions, compare Commons and Lords procedures where relevant, and explain causal links rather than just asserting them. For evaluation (AO3) you should weigh competing arguments and make reasoned judgements; for example, if asked whether the Lords should be elected, consider democratic legitimacy versus the value of expertise and the practical constraints of the Parliament Acts. Use short, precise case studies to support your points: a named Public Bill, a select committee inquiry that changed policy, a prominent private members’ bill or a recent high-profile clash between Commons and Lords will strengthen analysis. Time management matters: plan a brief paragraph skeleton, allocate time to build argument and reserve a final paragraph to draw together findings and reach a balanced conclusion. Throughout, use political vocabulary (e.g. parliamentary sovereignty, delegated legislation, Salisbury Convention, select committee scrutiny) accurately and link each point back to the question. This approach shows the examiner you can deploy knowledge, analyse political mechanisms and evaluate consequences — the three skills assessed across Edexcel’s A-level Politics papers.
