# Political parties and party systems (A-level Politics Pearson Edexcel)

## What political parties are for and why they matter
Political parties are the principal organisations that aggregate interests, recruit and socialise political actors, present policy programmes to voters and, if successful, form governments. In a representative democracy like the UK they provide the mechanism by which citizens translate preferences into public policy: they select candidates, contest elections, organise legislative business and offer coherent sets of priorities that voters can endorse. Parties also structure political debate, make accountability intelligible by offering alternative teams of office-holders, and link state institutions with civil society through membership networks, trade unions, business groups and think tanks. Understanding parties is essential because the shape and health of British politics – who governs, what policies are enacted, and how citizens participate – depends on party organisation, ideology and the interactions between parties across the UK’s multi-level system.

## Functions and internal organisation of parties
Parties perform a set of recognisable functions: they recruit and prepare candidates, formulate manifestos, mobilise voters in campaigns, organise parliamentary business and provide oppositions that hold governments to account. Internally, parties can be highly centralised or more federated. Leadership selection, candidate shortlisting and the balance between the membership and the parliamentary party all influence how a party behaves. Funding and resources matter: parties draw income from membership subscriptions, donations, trade union affiliation fees, campaign fundraising and limited public funding or reimbursement for some campaign costs. The rules governing funding and registration, introduced since the late 1990s, aim to increase transparency but controversies about large private donations and the influence of lobbyists persist. Parties also produce policy through formal structures – conferences, policy commissions and affiliated think tanks – and through informal networks that may tie ministers to business or external campaigners.

## The major parties: origins, ideas and modern transformations
The modern UK party system grew from 19th- and early-20th-century realignments. The Conservative Party traces its roots through the Tory tradition and the politics of figures such as Disraeli to a durable emphasis on order, tradition and market-friendly conservatism. Twentieth-century Conservatism has contained tensions between one-nation paternalism, which emphasises social cohesion and state responsibility, and the New Right that from the late 1970s promoted market liberalisation, deregulation and a tougher law-and-order stance.

Labour emerged from organised labour and socialist groups, formally coalescing around the Labour Representation Committee at the start of the twentieth century before becoming the principal party of the left. Its ideas have ranged from classical social democracy and nationalisation programmes in the post-war period to Keynesian welfare-state commitments. From the mid-1990s New Labour under Tony Blair repositioned the party towards the centre with a "Third Way" that accepted market mechanisms while promising social investment and opportunity.

The Liberal Party, once one of the main parties, declined in the 20th century and ultimately merged with the Social Democratic Party in 1988 to form the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal tradition emphasises civil liberties, formal equality and a mixed approach to the economy. In recent decades the Liberal Democrats have often played the role of third party, with occasional influence disproportionate to their seat totals, culminating in their participation in the 2010–15 Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition.

These broad ideological traditions help explain party positions on the economy, welfare, civil liberties and foreign policy, but each party contains internal factions and has adapted over time in response to social and economic change.

## Minor and emerging parties: regionalism, single-issue and new challengers
Minor and emerging parties have reshaped British politics in important ways, particularly at a regional level. The Scottish National Party (SNP) transformed Scottish politics from the 1990s and became dominant in Westminster representation for Scotland after the 2015 general election, driven by a commitment to Scottish self-government and, from 2012–14, a successful independence referendum campaign. Plaid Cymru performs a similar role in Wales, while in Northern Ireland politics is organised around unionist and nationalist parties with power‑sharing arrangements.

Single-issue and protest parties, such as the Green Party, have made electoral breakthroughs in specific constituencies and at local government level, pressing environmental and sustainability issues onto the mainstream agenda. Populist challengers including UKIP and its later iterations had a decisive impact on party competition in the 2010s by prioritising EU withdrawal; their real influence was often through shaping the agenda of larger parties rather than winning many seats under first-past-the-post. The emergence of new parties or the reconfiguration of old ones is often triggered by major constitutional or social shocks, such as devolution, the 2014 Scottish referendum and the 2016 Brexit referendum.

## How party systems interact with electoral systems
The UK’s dominant electoral method for Westminster elections is first-past-the-post (FPTP), which tends to favour larger parties and produce single-party governments by translating concentrated geographic support into seats. FPTP encourages a focus on winning marginal constituencies and often creates “safe” seats where incumbents are secure. By contrast, devolved institutions use different systems: the Additional Member System (AMS) in Scotland and Wales combines constituency seats with top-up regional lists, producing more proportional outcomes and allowing smaller parties to flourish. Northern Ireland uses the Single Transferable Vote (STV), which encourages multi-member representation and coalition politics.

Electoral systems shape party strategies and the broader party system. Under FPTP smaller parties face strong incentives to form electoral pacts or focus on local concentrations of support, while proportional or mixed systems produce multi-party legislatures and increase the likelihood of coalitions or minority governments, as the 2010 Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition demonstrated. Debates about reform, such as calls for proportional representation in Westminster, persist because system choice affects fairness, representation and governmental stability.

## Why parties succeed, fail and change: voters, media and structural trends
Party fortunes are driven by a mix of long-term structural factors and short-term contingencies. Long-term trends such as dealignment from traditional social classes, the decline in mass party membership since the 1980s, and the rise of issue-based and identity politics have altered party core support. Classic examples include the erosion of class-based Labour voting and the growth of floating voters who change their choices between elections.

Short-term factors can also be decisive. Leadership, charismatic or otherwise, shapes perceptions of competence; the 1997 Labour landslide exemplifies a successful appeal to governing competency and modernisation. Manifestos, campaign strategy and the perceived economic performance of incumbents are central to electoral outcomes. Media and opinion polls now frame public debate and are capable of amplifying events or scandals; the influence of social media has added complexity to how parties communicate and mobilise supporters. Regional issues and constitutional debates, especially devolution and Brexit, have demonstrated that national parties can lose ground rapidly where regional identities and specific policy preferences diverge from national leadership.

Institutional rules and funding shape party behaviour as well. Reforms to party finance, disclosure requirements and the regulation of campaign activity influence how parties raise and use money, while internal rules govern candidate selection and leadership contests. Pressure groups, trade unions and think tanks can bolster party resources and policy formation, but they also create competing sources of influence within the political system.

## Party system change: realignment, fragmentation and the politics of today
British party politics has been characterised in recent decades by both continuity and upheaval. The two-party dominance that marked much of the twentieth century has given way at times to multi-party competition, regional polarisation and electoral volatility. Realignment occurs when long-standing bonds between social groups and parties break down and new patterns emerge: the collapse of the Liberal vote after 1918 and its partial recovery in the late twentieth century, the Labour realignment of 1997 under New Labour, and the more recent reconfiguration around Brexit are all examples.

Fragmentation of the party system raises questions about representation and governability. Multi-party systems can better reflect diverse preferences, but they can also make decisive government harder to achieve. The UK’s hybrid map of single-member constituencies at Westminster and more proportional systems in the devolved nations creates a complex political geography where different parties can dominate in different arenas. Understanding contemporary politics therefore requires attention to both national trends and regional dynamics.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on political parties and party systems, always begin with a clear definition and signpost your argument: explain what you understand by key terms such as “party system”, “realignment” or “party funding”. Use a short, focused introduction to frame the answer and then develop analytical paragraphs that combine knowledge (AO1) with explanation and application (AO2). Where the question asks for evaluation, balance the analysis by weighing strengths and weaknesses, considering counter-arguments and drawing reasoned conclusions (AO3).

For source-based questions, use the source as a starting point: summarise its claim in your own words, interrogate its assumptions and then bring in detailed external knowledge to corroborate or challenge it. Always contextualise examples: give specific elections, dates and policies to show the examiner you can apply concepts to events (for instance, Blair’s 1997 modernisation, Thatcher’s New Right reforms, the 2015 SNP surge in Scotland, the 2019 Conservative majority and Brexit realignment). Where comparative points are useful — for example, contrasting Westminster FPTP with Scottish AMS — make those links explicit and explain their consequences for party competition.

Structure your essays so each paragraph makes one clear point supported by evidence and analysis, and finish with a concise conclusion that directly answers the question. Time-manage by allocating marks proportionally: for a 30-mark question allow time for planning, writing and a short review; for synoptic or evaluation tasks ensure you reserve time to draw connections across different parts of the specification. Finally, use political vocabulary accurately, deploy well-chosen case studies, and where appropriate bring in thinkers and party-ideological frameworks to deepen the analysis, but always keep the focus on answering the question posed.
