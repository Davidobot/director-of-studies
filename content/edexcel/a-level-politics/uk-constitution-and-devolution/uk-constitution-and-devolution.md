# The UK constitution and devolution (A-level Politics Pearson Edexcel)

## Nature and sources of the UK constitution
The UK constitution is uncodified, unentrenched and historically organic: it is built from different types of authority rather than contained in a single written text. Students should be able to explain the five classic sources of the constitution — statute law, common law, conventions, authoritative works and treaties — and illustrate each with familiar examples. Statute law includes landmark Acts such as the Bill of Rights (1689), the Acts of Union and modern statutes like the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Scotland Acts. Common law is the body of judge-made law and principles developed in courts. Conventions are politically binding practices rather than legal rules; examples include the Prime Minister being a member of the House of Commons and the Salisbury Convention that limits the House of Lords’ interference with government manifesto commitments. Authoritative works such as A. V. Dicey’s writings have shaped understanding of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law, while treaties (for instance membership of the EU in the past) have affected the legal landscape. Understanding how these sources interact is central: parliamentary sovereignty remains the theoretical core, but the rule of law and evolving practice (including EU membership and its repeal) have complicated both theory and practice.

## The constitution since the late 1990s: major reforms and their effects
From 1997 onwards the constitution was noticeably reworked. The New Labour government introduced high-profile changes including devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Human Rights Act 1998, the creation of the Supreme Court via the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, and House of Lords reform that largely removed hereditary peers. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 altered the timing of general elections but was later repealed; a sequence of later governments also made practical adjustments such as the introduction and subsequent abolition of “English Votes for English Laws”. These reforms illustrate two features of the UK constitution: firstly, its adaptability — major changes have been achieved through primary legislation and political negotiation — and secondly, the asymmetry and patchwork character of the settlement. The creation of the Supreme Court and the codification of judicial appointments strengthened judicial independence, while the Human Rights Act incorporated European Convention rights into domestic law, embedding rights protection into the UK legal order without creating an entrenched bill of rights.

## Devolution: structures and distinctive settlements
Devolution is the greatest change to the UK’s territorial constitution in modern times, but it is not uniform. Scotland has the most extensive legislature, with the Scottish Parliament empowered to pass primary legislation in devolved fields and with reserved powers remaining at Westminster. Wales moved from having an assembly with secondary powers to gaining primary law-making powers following a 2011 referendum, and subsequent Wales Acts (including provisions in 2014 and 2017) further clarified Welsh institutions. Northern Ireland’s system rests on power-sharing created by the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement (1998): the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive operate on a consociational model designed to reflect unionist and nationalist communities. Each settlement reflects differing historical, political and cultural contexts and all are asymmetrical: Scotland’s devolution is more extensive than Wales’s, while Northern Ireland’s institutions are founded on a peace agreement and are therefore especially sensitive to political breakdown. These differences generate practical questions about funding, accountability and the constitutional relationship with Westminster.

## Devolution in England and cross-cutting tensions
England lacks a separate parliament, a fact that creates distinctive constitutional tensions. The West Lothian question — why MPs from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland can vote on England-only matters while English MPs cannot vote on devolved matters — remains a core debate. Attempts to address this included English Votes for English Laws (EVEL), which gave English (or English and Welsh) MPs a special role in some Commons decisions but was politically controversial and later discontinued. Regional and city devolution has developed differently: London has an elected mayor and assembly, and since the 2010s combined authorities with elected metro-mayors (for Greater Manchester, West Midlands and others) have been created through negotiated ‘devolution deals’. Financial arrangements such as the Barnett formula determine public spending allocations and stir disputes about fairness between nations and regions of the UK. These tensions underline the asymmetry, and students should be ready to discuss the constitutional and political implications of a unitary state with strong regional differentiation.

## Sovereignty, the rule of law and the role of the courts
One of the clearest ways to interpret the UK constitution is through the twin pillars of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law. Parliamentary sovereignty means Parliament can make or unmake any law; the rule of law requires that government acts within the law and citizens enjoy legal protection. In practice these principles interact — sometimes uneasily — and the courts have increasingly played a role in resolving disputes. Judicial review allows courts to examine executive action for legality, reasonableness and procedural fairness; the Supreme Court’s judgments have landmark constitutional significance. Recent high-profile cases illustrate these dynamics. The Miller (2017) judgment confirmed that the government could not trigger the EU withdrawal process without parliamentary authorisation, underscoring Parliament’s role; the prorogation judgment (R (Miller) v Prime Minister, 2019) found that an extended prorogation in 2019 was unlawful because it frustrated Parliament’s constitutional role, a decision that reinforced limits on executive power and the practical operation of the rule of law. The courts’ ability to adjudicate on devolution disputes, prerogative powers and human rights demonstrates how legal and political sovereignty can be tested and balanced in real time.

## Brexit and its constitutional impact on devolution and sovereignty
The UK’s decision to leave the European Union has had profound constitutional consequences. Legally, the European Communities Act 1972 — the statute that gave EU law effect in the UK — was repealed as part of the withdrawal process and major powers returned to Westminster in theory. Politically, the redistribution of those powers provoked disputes with devolved institutions about which powers should be exercised where, producing cases and political negotiations. The Sewel Convention — the political commitment that Westminster will not normally legislate on devolved matters without consent — was given statutory recognition but remained a political, not a legally enforceable, constraint; the Supreme Court clarified this point. Brexit also intensified questions about the location of sovereignty: while Parliament is legally sovereign, political sovereignty (the practical authority and legitimacy to make decisions) has shown itself to be dispersed — particularly in contested areas like trade, immigration and environmental regulation. The Brexit process, plus referendums such as Scotland’s 2014 independence vote and the UK-wide 2016 EU referendum, have exposed faultlines about constitutional legitimacy and prompted renewed calls in some quarters for further devolution, federalisation or even independence.

## Debates about further constitutional reform: codification, rights and the House of Lords
Debate about the future of the constitution centres on choices that are both legal and political. One major question is whether the UK should adopt a codified, entrenched constitution. Proponents argue that codification would clarify the distribution of powers, entrench fundamental rights and reduce uncertainty about constitutional conventions. Opponents argue that flexibility is a strength, allowing the constitution to evolve and adapt without rigid legal constraint, and that political accountability is preferable to judicialising every constitutional question. Closely related is the debate over a bill of rights: the Human Rights Act incorporated Convention rights, but some call for a new, domestic bill to enshrine and shape rights protection differently. Another continuing theme is reform of the House of Lords: proposals range from modest changes in appointment and composition to replacement by an elected second chamber. Each option raises trade-offs between democratic legitimacy, expertise and the revising role the Lords currently performs. Students should be able to weigh these arguments and use examples — such as the political fallout of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the prorogation case, or the uneven devolution settlement — to show how different reforms would change the constitutional balance.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on the constitution and devolution, begin with clear definitions: define key concepts such as parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, devolution, and the relevant institutions. A concise introduction that sets out the parameters of your answer helps the examiner follow your argument. For analysis (AO2) explain how the constitutional principle operates in practice and use specific examples: cite statutes (for example the Scotland Act), key judicial decisions (Miller 2017; prorogation 2019), and political events (the 2014 Scottish referendum, the Good Friday Agreement). For evaluation (AO3) weigh arguments on both sides and consider consequences: for instance, when discussing codification, assess trade-offs between clarity and flexibility, and the likely political and legal effects of entrenchment. In essays that ask “to what extent” or “assess”, adopt a balanced structure where each main paragraph contains a claim, supporting evidence, analysis of impact, and a short evaluative link back to the question. Use paragraphs to separate explanation from evaluation so your AO1 and AO2 material is distinct from your judgments. Time management is important: for a 30-mark essay allow time for a brief plan, roughly two-thirds of your allotted minutes on development and analysis, and leave five to ten minutes for a focused conclusion that makes a clear judgement. In source questions, read the source carefully, extract its argument, place it in context and then bring in your own knowledge to corroborate, qualify or contradict the source. Finally, always signpost your argument so the examiner can see how your evidence supports your conclusion; well-chosen, contemporary examples and precise use of constitutional terminology will maximise your marks.
