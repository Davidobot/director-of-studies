# Prime Minister, Cabinet and executive power (A-level Politics Pearson Edexcel)

## The executive in the UK and the role of the Prime Minister
The executive is the branch of government that makes and implements policy. In the UK it is led by the Prime Minister, who chairs the Cabinet and directs the overall political direction of government. The Prime Minister is first among equals in theory, yet in practice occupies a uniquely powerful position: they set the legislative agenda, represent the government to Parliament and the public, lead their party, and act as the face of government both domestically and internationally. Understanding the PM’s role requires attention to constitutional sources and political practice: while many powers rest on statute or convention, a considerable range of influence depends on political authority, control of party and parliament, and institutional resources located at Number 10 and the Cabinet Office.

## Formal powers and sources: prerogative, legislation and secondary powers
A Prime Minister’s formal authority draws on the UK’s hybrid, largely uncodified constitution. Key formal powers derive from statute law, common law and the royal prerogative. The royal prerogative is a set of historic powers formally vested in the Crown but exercised in modern practice by ministers; these include appointment and dismissal of ministers, conduct of foreign affairs, deployment of the armed forces and the making of treaties. Parliament is the supreme law-making body and the executive needs primary legislation to create or change significant policy. In addition the executive uses delegated or secondary legislation to implement detailed policy without returning to primary legislation each time. Over recent decades Parliament and courts have introduced checks — for example judicial review can declare executive actions unlawful and parliamentary procedures can scrutinise secondary legislation — but the executive still retains substantial initiative and discretion in day-to-day government.

## Cabinet, collective responsibility and ministerial accountability
The Cabinet is the senior decision-making collective composed of the Prime Minister and senior ministers. Its functions include agreeing major policy, coordinating government departments and presenting a united front to Parliament and the country. Two conventions are central to Cabinet government. Collective ministerial responsibility requires that ministers publicly support Cabinet decisions or resign; it preserves government unity but can be relaxed in exceptional circumstances (for example governments have sometimes allowed free votes on conscience issues). Individual ministerial responsibility holds that ministers are accountable for the conduct of their department and their personal behaviour; in practice it is applied unevenly, with resignations more likely when political pressure makes them politically desirable. Parliament provides tools for holding ministers to account: Prime Minister’s Questions, ministerial question times, select committees and debates give opportunities to expose failures, force explanations and shape public perception. The balance between Cabinet discussion and prime ministerial direction, and between public unity and private disagreement, is a constant dynamic in British government.

## How Prime Ministers build and exercise power: appointments, patronage and the centre
Prime Ministers increase their influence in several practical ways. The selection and dismissal of ministers is a primary instrument of control: appointments reward loyalty and shape the tone of policy. Patronage extends to appointments outside Cabinet, including junior ministers, trade envoys and public appointments, shaping networks of influence. The institutional centre of government — Number 10, the Cabinet Office and the Prime Minister’s Office — is crucial. Prime Ministers have developed central policy units, special advisers and political offices that coordinate strategy, manage communications and filter proposals before they reach ministers or Parliament. The growth of well-resourced policy units and the use of special advisers, especially under New Labour and subsequent governments, increased the capacity of the PM’s office to define priorities and control the policy-making process. Cabinet committees provide a way to manage detailed work while preserving Cabinet unity; how a Prime Minister chairs these committees, and which ministers are included, reveals their governing style and degree of control.

## Limits on prime ministerial power: Parliament, party, events and the courts
Despite extensive powers, Prime Ministers are constrained by institutional and political realities. Parliamentary arithmetic is decisive: a large parliamentary majority empowers a PM to pass legislation and discipline rebels, while a small majority, coalition or minority government sharply curtails ability to impose policy. Party unity matters greatly; strong leaders with unified parties can be dominant, while factionalised parties force compromise. Backbench MPs, select committees and opposition can all erode the executive’s freedom. External events also constrain the PM: economic crises, wars, scandals or public health emergencies can either strengthen a Prime Minister (rallying-round-the-flag effect) or precipitate their decline if mishandled. The courts impose legal limits: judicial review and human rights law can defeat executive action that exceeds legal authority. Finally, the media and public opinion are powerful soft constraints; relentless negative coverage can undermine authority and encourage internal party challenges or resignations.

## The debate over presidentialisation and elective dictatorship
Scholars and commentators debate whether the UK has moved towards “prime ministerial government” or even a form of “presidentialisation.” The presidentialisation thesis argues that modern Prime Ministers resemble presidents because they command party media resources, focus political attention on a single figure, personalise politics and centralise policy-making. Critics point to institutional checks and the absence of direct electoral mandate for a PM as counter-evidence. The concern about “elective dictatorship,” coined to emphasise the danger of a strong executive dominating Parliament and making decisions with limited effective restraint, remains a central theme in critiques of modern government. Whether the executive is dominant depends on the political context: a large majority and disciplined party can produce strong government, but circumstances such as coalition agreements, fragile majorities or judicial interventions reduce the likelihood of an unchecked executive.

## Two illustrative Prime Ministers: Thatcher and Blair
Illustrative case studies make the abstract arguments concrete. Margaret Thatcher (Prime Minister 1979–1990) is often cited as a paradigmatic strong Prime Minister. She reshaped Conservative Party ideology, pursued a clear programme of economic liberalisation and privatisation, and used a disciplined parliamentary majority and a combative leadership style to impose policy. Yet her power had limits: in 1990 internal dissent and rebellions over Europe and leadership style culminated in a challenge that led to her resignation, showing that party confidence and internal structures can remove even a seemingly dominant leader.

Tony Blair (Prime Minister 1997–2007) exemplifies post-1997 centralisation. New Labour created a powerful central policy apparatus, and Blair’s control of the party and use of special advisers and a strong communications operation consolidated prime ministerial authority. At the same time judicial and parliamentary scrutiny increased: the Human Rights Act and the creation of the Supreme Court, the role of select committees, and eventual fallout over Iraq (including high-profile ministerial resignations and public controversy) demonstrated that legal mechanisms, parliamentary inquiry and public opinion can constrain and damage executive authority. Comparing these two illustrates that strong prime ministerial influence is achievable but is always contingent on party dynamics, institutional arrangements and public support.

## Recent developments and trends to watch
The constitutional and political landscape continues to evolve. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 reduced the Prime Minister’s discretion to call elections, altering a key component of political strategy; this was later repealed in 2022, returning the prerogative to call elections to the executive, illustrating how statutory change can alter executive tools. Episodes such as the 2019 prorogation controversy, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, demonstrate judicial willingness to act as a check on executive abuse of prerogative. Brexit has also reshaped executive practice: the need to negotiate complex agreements, to manage party divisions and to respond to referendums has affected prime ministerial authority and style. The increasing professionalisation of communications, the growth of special advisers, and the spotlight of 24/7 media continue to make personal leadership style a major factor in how executive power operates in practice.

## Exam technique
When answering questions about the Prime Minister, Cabinet and executive power, begin by defining key terms clearly (for example royal prerogative, collective responsibility, Cabinet government, prime ministerial dominance). Apply a structured approach: explain the formal sources of power, outline how power is exercised in practice, and give concrete examples to support your analysis. For AO2 marks focus on analysis and explanation: explain the mechanisms (appointments, patronage, Number 10 policy units, secondary legislation) and how they translate into power. For AO3 marks offer balanced evaluation: weigh enabling factors (majority, party unity, institutional resources) against constraints (Parliamentary arithmetic, backbench revolt, judicial review, media and public opinion), and reach a reasoned judgement on the extent of PM power in the context given. Use specific case studies to illustrate points—choose one pre-1997 Prime Minister and one post-1997 leader as required by the specification (for example Thatcher and Blair) and show how the same tools produced different outcomes in different constitutional and party contexts. When a source is provided, integrate it: summarise its argument concisely, use it to prompt own analysis and then evaluate its reliability, perspective and limitations. Time-manage: for a 30-mark essay aim for clear introduction, three or four developed analytical paragraphs each combining concept, example and evaluation, and a succinct conclusion that answers the question directly. Finally, always link back to the question in each paragraph, and ensure your final judgement is explicit, qualified and supported by evidence.
