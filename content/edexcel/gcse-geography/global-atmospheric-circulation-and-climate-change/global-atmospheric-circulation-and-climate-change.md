# Global atmospheric circulation and climate change (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Global atmospheric circulation: the big picture
The atmosphere behaves as a global system that moves heat and moisture from the Equator to the poles. Solar energy is not distributed evenly across the Earth: the tropics receive more direct sunlight than higher latitudes, and the planet balances this by moving warm air and water polewards. This large-scale movement is organised into three circulation cells in each hemisphere. The Hadley cell rises at the Equator where intense heating causes air to ascend and form low pressure and cloud. Air then moves polewards aloft, sinks around 30° latitude in the subtropics forming high pressure belts, and returns as surface trade winds. Between about 30° and 60° the Ferrel cell acts as a zone of variable weather with prevailing westerlies, while the Polar cell involves cold air sinking at the poles and flowing towards lower latitudes as polar easterlies. The result is a belted pattern of high and low pressure and predictable wind systems that drive climate zones around the world and influence regional weather.

Understanding the links between cells, pressure belts and prevailing winds helps explain why deserts are common near 30° latitude and why temperate zones have more variable weather. For GCSE work it is useful to be able to draw a simple diagram of the three cells, label the trade winds, westerlies and polar easterlies, and explain how the global circulation transfers heat polewards. This framework also underpins the formation of many weather hazards and the distribution of climates.

## Oceans and heat redistribution
The atmosphere does not work alone. Ocean currents transport huge amounts of heat across the planet’s surface and interact with the atmosphere to shape regional climates. Warm currents such as the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift carry heat from the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic towards north-western Europe, making the UK milder than locations at similar latitudes in North America. Cold currents, such as the Labrador Current, cool adjacent coasts and can influence marine ecosystems and fog formation.

Ocean currents are driven by a combination of wind, the Earth’s rotation, differences in water density and the layout of continents. They moderate seasonal extremes and affect rainfall patterns. For example, when ocean temperatures rise in a region, more evaporation can supply moisture to storms, increasing their intensity. The interplay between oceanic heat transport and atmospheric circulation is therefore a key part of understanding both normal climates and changes that increase the risk of extreme events.

## Natural climate change through time
Climate has never been constant. Over geological time the Earth has alternated between glacial (ice age) and interglacial periods, particularly during the Quaternary period. Natural drivers of these changes include variations in Earth’s orbit and tilt — known collectively as Milankovitch cycles — which alter how solar energy is distributed across seasons and latitudes. Periodic changes in solar output, large volcanic eruptions that inject cooling aerosol particles into the stratosphere, and internal variability such as ocean circulation changes have all caused climates to warm or cool in the past.

We reconstruct past climates using evidence preserved in natural archives. Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica contain trapped air bubbles that record past atmospheric composition, including greenhouse gas concentrations. Tree rings provide annual records of growth linked to temperature and moisture. Pollen preserved in sediments shows which plants were present at different times, indicating past climates. These palaeoclimate records show that current rates of warming and the recent steep rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide are unusual in the context of the last many thousands of years.

## Recent climate change and human causes
Since the Industrial Revolution human activities have introduced large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, methane from agriculture and landfill, and nitrous oxide from fertiliser use. These gases trap heat through the greenhouse effect. The natural greenhouse effect is essential for life; the enhanced greenhouse effect, caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, raises global temperatures and leads to a range of environmental changes.

Global temperature records show a clear warming trend over the last century, with the last few decades being the warmest in the instrumental record. Important consequences include changing seasonal patterns, melting glaciers and ice sheets, rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and ice melt, and shifts in ecosystems and species distributions. Feedback mechanisms can amplify warming: for example, melting Arctic sea ice reduces surface reflectivity (albedo), so more solar energy is absorbed, accelerating warming; thawing permafrost can release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

When explaining human causes in an exam answer, explicitly link activities to greenhouse gases and then to consequences. For example, increased coal combustion in power stations raises CO2 concentrations, which leads to a warmer atmosphere and greater glacier retreat, affecting water supplies in some mountain regions.

## Weather hazards linked to circulation and climate change: tropical cyclones
Tropical cyclones, known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on the ocean basin, are among the most dramatic weather hazards. They form over very warm seas (typically above 26–27°C) where intense evaporation provides moisture and latent heat. This warms and lifts the air, creating a low-pressure centre. As air converges and rises, thunderstorms organise around a central eye if the system becomes strong, producing very high winds, torrential rain and storm surges at the coast.

The global atmospheric circulation influences where cyclones form and move. They originate in the tropical trade wind belts where large amounts of heat and moisture are available; steering winds in the mid-troposphere then guide their tracks. Human-induced warming of sea surface temperatures can increase the potential intensity of tropical cyclones, even if the total number of storms does not rise markedly. Stronger storms bring higher storm surges and greater inland flooding.

Impacts and responses differ between countries. A developed-country example is Hurricane Katrina (USA), where extensive infrastructure and high wealth did not prevent large economic losses and over 1,800 deaths, partly due to failures in flood defences and emergency response. A developing-country example is Typhoon Haiyan (Philippines) where the combination of extreme intensity, high coastal population density and weaker infrastructure led to catastrophic loss of life and widespread damage. For GCSE answers it is effective to compare impacts and responses, showing how preparedness, early warning systems, coastal defences and post-disaster recovery differ between contexts.

## Droughts and regional vulnerability
Droughts are complex hazards with meteorological, hydrological and human causes. Meteorological drought refers to prolonged below-average rainfall, hydrological drought relates to reduced river flows and groundwater, and human-induced drought can result from over-abstraction, land-use change or dam construction. Global circulation patterns set long-term rainfall regimes, so some regions are inherently more drought-prone because of persistent high-pressure systems or shifting monsoon patterns.

The impacts of drought include crop failures, water shortages, economic losses and environmental degradation. The Sahel in Africa experienced severe droughts in the late 20th century, causing widespread famine and displacement. Australia’s Millennium Drought between 1997 and 2010 led to major restrictions on water use, agricultural losses and changes in water management policy. Responses can be short term, such as emergency water supply and food aid, or long term, such as changes to irrigation practices, drought-resistant crops, water recycling and national water storage strategies. When answering exam questions on drought, link the physical cause to social and economic consequences and show how vulnerability depends on development level and management options.

## The UK’s climate and future changes
The UK’s climate today is temperate and maritime. Its weather is moderated by its mid-latitude position and the influence of the Atlantic Ocean, especially the northward transport of heat by the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Drift. This results in relatively mild winters and cool summers compared with other locations at similar latitudes. Within the UK there are spatial variations in temperature, prevailing winds and rainfall: western and upland areas receive more rainfall, while the east tends to be drier.

Over the last 1,000 years the UK has experienced notable climate variations, including the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. Instrumental records over the last 150 years show a warming trend in line with global patterns. Future projections suggest warmer average temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns with wetter winters and drier summers, rising sea levels and increased frequency of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall and storm surges. These changes affect agriculture (changing crop suitability), ecosystems (shifts in species ranges), and infrastructure (greater flood risk). For GCSE answers, make sure you can explain how the UK’s geographic location affects its climate, describe recent changes, and outline likely impacts along with adaptation responses such as improved flood defences, sustainable drainage systems, and coastal management strategies.

## Evidence, monitoring and geographical skills
Studying climate and atmospheric processes involves a wide range of data sources and skills. Scientists and geographers use long-term instrumental datasets, satellite imagery, climate models, and palaeoclimate proxies like ice cores, tree rings and pollen records. In the classroom and in exams you will be expected to interpret climate graphs, time-series data and maps. GIS is a powerful tool for analysing spatial patterns, for example tracking the movement of tropical cyclones or mapping areas of drought risk or projected sea-level rise.

Quantitative skills include calculating means and rates of change, drawing and interpreting graphs, and using statistical measures where appropriate. For tropical cyclones you might be asked to use wind speed and pressure data to estimate intensity using scales such as the Saffir–Simpson scale. For climate change questions it's useful to show how data provide evidence: rising CO2 measurements from ice core bubbles and atmospheric monitoring stations, combined with temperature records and rising sea levels, form a coherent picture supporting the greenhouse explanation.

Fieldwork develops practical understanding too. Analysing local weather patterns, constructing simple climate graphs, and using secondary sources to compare historical and modern records are all valid ways to connect classroom theory with real-world evidence. Practise describing patterns, offering clear explanations using physical processes, and linking data to named examples and case studies.

## Exam technique
Answering questions on global atmospheric circulation and climate change requires both factual knowledge and the ability to apply that knowledge to specific contexts. Always begin by carefully reading the question and noting the command word. If asked to "describe", give a clear account of features or processes. If asked to "explain", develop causes and consequences in linked sentences (cause → process → effect). For "compare" questions, explicitly contrast two items and include similarities and differences. When a question asks for a named example or case study, use a real place (for instance, Hurricane Katrina—USA or Typhoon Haiyan—Philippines for tropical cyclones; the Sahel for droughts) and make sure details (year, impacts, responses) support your points.

For extended writing (8–12 mark) answers structure your response with a short introduction that outlines your argument, two or three developed paragraphs each making a clear point supported by evidence and illustration, and a concluding sentence that draws together your judgement. Use specialist terminology—terms such as Hadley cell, trade winds, enhanced greenhouse effect, storm surge, Saffir–Simpson category—and apply them accurately. Include data where required: show workings for any calculations, refer to trends on graphs, and interpret what the data mean for the question.

Link processes to impacts and then to human responses. For example, explain how warmer sea surface temperatures can increase cyclone intensity (process), lead to greater coastal flooding and economic losses (impact), and prompt both structural defences and disaster planning (response). When evaluating responses, consider advantages and disadvantages and recognise differences between developed and developing countries in capacity and resources.

Manage your time in the exam by allocating minutes according to marks. Leave time to check your extended answers for clarity, spelling and grammar; remember that up to four marks are awarded for spelling, punctuation, grammar and the correct use of specialist terminology. Practise past-paper questions, use labelled diagrams to support explanations when helpful, and always link theory to named examples to maximise the clarity and relevance of your answers.
