# Ecosystems, biodiversity and management (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## What ecosystems and biomes are — global patterns and controls
Ecosystems are communities of living organisms interacting with each other and with their physical environment. At the largest scale these communities form biomes — broad, recognisable belts of vegetation such as tropical rainforests, temperate deciduous forests, boreal (taiga) forests, grasslands, deserts and tundra. The global distribution of biomes is controlled primarily by climate: temperature and precipitation determine which plants can thrive, and in turn which animals and micro-organisms the system can support. Local factors such as soil type, altitude and drainage modify these broad patterns so that within the same biome there can be many different ecosystems. For example, tropical mountains may host cloud forests rather than lowland rainforest because cooler temperatures and persistent mist change the local conditions. When revising, imagine how a change in just one element of climate or soil would cascade through the whole system: fewer decomposers changes soil fertility, which changes plant communities and the animals that depend on them.

## The biosphere: services, resources and the nutrient cycle
The biosphere is the thin living layer on Earth that sustains people and other life. It provides a wide range of goods and services that underpin economies and societies. Provisioning services include food, timber, fibre and medicines; regulating services help control climate and water quality; supporting services such as nutrient cycling and soil formation make production possible; and cultural services provide recreation, spiritual value and scientific knowledge. Understanding nutrient cycles is essential: nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus move between stores — vegetation, soil, litter and the atmosphere — and flows are driven by processes like decomposition, uptake by plants and leaching. Tropical rainforests, for example, often have rapid nutrient cycling with most nutrients held in living biomass rather than in the soil, so when trees are removed those nutrients are quickly lost. By contrast, temperate deciduous woodlands have more substantial nutrient stores in their soils and seasonal litter layers, giving them a more resilient short-term response to disturbance but leaving them vulnerable to longer-term pressures such as repeated clearance or pollution.

## The UK’s ecosystems and the importance of marine values
The United Kingdom supports a mosaic of ecosystems adapted to its temperate, maritime climate. Moorlands and heaths are found on higher, acidic soils and are shaped by grazing, burning and peat-forming processes. Deciduous woodlands, many of them ancient or semi-natural, occur on more fertile lowland soils and support a range of breeding birds and mammals. Wetlands, including reedbeds and estuaries, are hotspots for biodiversity and act as natural flood storage. Around the UK, marine ecosystems are of particular importance: shelf seas provide fisheries, carbon storage and recreational opportunities, but they are threatened by overfishing, pollution, coastal development and warming seas. When answering exam questions on the UK, it is useful to link these ecosystems to human activities: agriculture and urban expansion shape the landscape, while conservation designations and management schemes aim to balance use and protection.

## Tropical rainforests — structure, biodiversity and adaptations
Tropical rainforests are among the most complex and species-rich ecosystems on Earth. They are characterised by high, year-round temperatures and abundant rainfall which together support dense, multi-layered vegetation. The canopy is dominant and creates microclimates below, with understory shrubs and ground-layer plants adapted to low light. Soils are often thin and nutrient-poor because high rainfall and rapid decomposition mean nutrients cycle quickly through living biomass rather than remaining in the soil. This rapid cycling supports very high biodiversity: countless tree species, lianas, epiphytes, insects, birds and mammals have evolved specialised niches. Plants show adaptations such as buttress roots for stability in shallow soils and drip tips to shed water efficiently; animals show adaptations such as camouflage, strong limbs for arboreal life and specialised feeding behaviours. The rainforest’s ecosystem services are extensive: they store carbon, regulate regional climate and water cycles, and supply timber, fruits, medicines and livelihoods. When explaining rainforest processes in the exam, be prepared to describe the Gersmehl model or similar nutrient cycle diagrams to show how inputs, stores and flows differ from temperate systems.

## Threats to rainforests and sustainable management — causes, consequences and responses
Tropical rainforests face intense pressure from a range of human activities. Economic drivers such as demand for agricultural commodities — cattle, soya and palm oil — combined with logging, mining and road construction create extensive deforestation. Population pressure and weak governance can accelerate clearance and lead to illegal logging. The consequences are local and global: loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, disruption of water cycles and the release of stored carbon, contributing to climate change. Responses to these threats range from protected areas and law enforcement to market-based approaches and community-led schemes. A useful example to remember is Costa Rica, which has pursued an integrated approach over recent decades: it has expanded protected areas, invested in reforestation, promoted ecotourism and implemented payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes that reward landowners for maintaining forest cover. These strategies have helped restore forest cover in parts of the country and supported biodiversity while creating economic benefits. In contrast, regions of the Amazon illustrate the difficulty of management at scale, where national policies, international demand and land-use change create ongoing conflicts. For exam answers, balance descriptions of causes and effects with evaluation of management strategies, noting strengths and limitations and giving named examples.

## Temperate deciduous woodlands — features, threats and UK management
Deciduous woodlands in temperate climates typically experience strong seasonality. Trees such as oak, beech and ash lose their leaves in winter, creating a marked annual cycle of productivity and litter fall. Soils are often richer than in tropical rainforests and support diverse ground flora and fungi. Biodiversity is moderate compared with tropical forests but includes many specialist species. These woodlands provide goods and services including timber, recreation, carbon storage and cultural heritage. They face threats from urban expansion, agricultural intensification, invasive non-native species, fragmentation and the effects of climate change, such as altered phenology or increased pest outbreaks. In the UK, sustainable management combines conservation designations, active forestry techniques and community involvement. The New Forest National Park, for example, illustrates a long-established multi-use landscape where traditional practices of grazing, woodland management and controlled access are balanced with conservation and tourism. Actions such as coppicing, selective thinning, native species planting and creation of continuous habitat corridors help maintain biodiversity while allowing timber production and recreation. When writing about deciduous woodlands in exams, use a named UK example to show how policies and practices operate at a local scale and mention practical measures that sustain both ecological and social values.

## Fieldwork, geographical skills and how to use evidence
Studying ecosystems offers many opportunities to develop geographical skills that are frequently examined. Field techniques such as transects and quadrats allow measurement of vegetation change across an environmental gradient, whether on a beach, a riverside or through woodland. In the classroom and exam you will need to interpret maps showing biome distribution, use climate graphs to explain why certain ecosystems occur in particular places, and read GIS outputs that reveal patterns of forest loss or habitat fragmentation. Understanding how to construct and interpret nutrient cycle diagrams and food webs is essential to explain ecosystem functioning. When working with data, practice drawing and analysing graphs, calculating means and rates of change where required, and using evidence to support conclusions. In fieldwork questions, be specific about methods, sample size, potential sources of error and how you would improve reliability; examiners reward clear, reflective discussion about methods as well as accurate description of results.

## Exam technique
Begin exam answers by carefully reading the question and noting command words such as "describe", "explain", "assess" or "evaluate"; they determine the depth and style of response. For short-answer questions, focus on precise facts and key terminology. For 8-mark and 12-mark extended-response questions, plan a short structure before writing: introduce the topic with a definition or general statement, develop points using the PEEL approach (point, explain, evidence/case study, link back), and finish with a concise conclusion or judgement. Always use named examples — a specific rainforest region or a UK woodland — to add credibility and to meet the criteria that require case-study detail. Where the question asks for causes and consequences, ensure each cause is linked to a clear effect; where it asks for an evaluation, present balanced arguments and end with a justified judgement. For questions that require use of data, refer to trends shown, calculate rates if asked, and integrate numerical evidence into your explanation. Remember that up to four marks are allocated for spelling, punctuation and grammar, and for correct use of specialist terminology, so write clearly and use key terms such as biodiversity, nutrient cycling, ecosystem services, deforestation, managed retreat, coppicing and payment for ecosystem services. Finally, practise under timed conditions using past paper-style questions, and always aim to link theory to the real world — that is where the strongest exam answers demonstrate understanding and judgement.
