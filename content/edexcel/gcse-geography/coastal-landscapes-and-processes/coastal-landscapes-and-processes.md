# Coastal landscapes and processes (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: the coast as a system
Coasts are dynamic systems where land, sea and atmosphere interact continuously. Understanding coastal landscapes means recognising the flow of energy (waves and wind), the movement of sediment alongshore and the influence of geology, climate and human activity. The coast is not a single process but a set of linked processes: weathering and mass movement operate on cliffs and slopes, waves erode and transport material, and deposition builds beaches, spits and bars. For GCSE you should see a stretch of coastline as an open system with inputs (sediment, energy from waves and wind), stores (beaches, dunes, offshore bars) and outputs (eroded material exported to deeper water). Learning how these parts interact helps explain why coastlines develop characteristic landforms and why some stretches retreat rapidly while others remain relatively stable.

## The processes that shape coasts
Weathering at the coast can be mechanical, chemical or biological. Mechanical weathering such as freeze–thaw, though more common in upland areas, weakens rock faces; salt crystallisation and chemical solution react with minerals; biological weathering from plant roots and burrowing animals also breaks rock down. Mass movement describes the downslope movement of material under gravity and is important where cliffs are undercut or saturated; sliding and slumping are commonly seen on soft, clay-rich cliffs after heavy rain. Erosion by the sea occurs through hydraulic action where waves compress air into cracks, abrading rock, and through abrasion where rock fragments carried by waves scour cliff faces. Attrition wears sediment particles into smaller, rounded forms while solution (or corrosion) dissolves susceptible rock such as chalk or limestone.

Transport processes move material along and across the shore. Traction rolls large pebbles along the seabed, saltation causes short hops of sand and shingle, suspension carries finer particles in the water column and solution keeps dissolved minerals in the flow. Longshore drift is particularly important: waves approaching the coast at an angle move sediment in a zigzag pattern along the beach, gradually shifting material down-drift. Deposition happens when wave energy falls, allowing sediment to settle and form beaches, spits and bars. Whether erosion, transport or deposition dominates at a particular place depends on wave energy, sediment supply and coastal shape.

## Waves, geology and climate: key controls on coastal change
Waves are the primary agents of coastal change and fall broadly into destructive and constructive types. Destructive waves are high-energy, steep and frequent during storms; they remove material from the beach through strong backwash and powerful erosion. Constructive waves are lower and flatter, with strong swash that deposits sediment and builds beaches. The character of waves at any coastline is influenced by wind strength, duration, fetch and local weather systems, so seasonal changes and storm frequency directly affect erosion and deposition rates.

Geology is equally decisive. Rock type and structure control resistance to erosion and the way cliffs and landforms evolve. Hard, resistant rocks such as granite and some sandstones erode slowly and tend to form headlands, while softer rocks like boulder clay and some shales erode quickly and give rise to bays and retreating coastlines. The arrangement of rock layers matters too: on a discordant coastline rock bands run at right angles to the sea and produce alternating headlands and bays; on a concordant coastline bands run parallel to the shore and may shelter softer rocks behind harder bands, producing features like coves when a band of weaker rock is breached. Joints, faults and bedding planes provide weaknesses that wave action exploits, leading to caves, arches and stacks.

Climate and weather patterns influence long-term rates of change. Prevailing wind direction determines dominant wave approach and therefore the direction of longshore drift. Storm frequency and intensity accelerate erosion, while longer-term climate change affects sea level and the energy available for coastal processes. In the UK, seasonal variations and occasional severe storms can cause episodic large losses of coastline.

## Erosional and depositional landforms with UK examples
Erosional landforms develop where removal of material dominates. Headlands and bays form where alternating bands of hard and soft rock along a discordant coastline produce differential erosion; examples of this process can be seen around parts of the Jurassic Coast. Caves form where waves exploit weaknesses such as joints; continued erosion may enlarge a cave into an arch, and when the arch collapses a stack remains, isolated from the cliff. Cliffs and wave-cut platforms are classic features of erosion where steep profiles are created by undercutting at high tide and collapse of unsupported rock, leaving a rocky platform exposed at low tide.

Depositional landforms appear where wave energy drops and sediment accumulates. Beaches are common in sheltered bays and can be made of sand, shingle or a mixture depending on source material and wave energy. Spits form where longshore drift deposits material across a bay mouth; if a spit grows and joins another headland it can form a bar, cutting off a lagoon from the sea. Saltmarshes and mudflats may develop behind spits and bars where fine sediment settles.

The UK offers clear case studies for these features. The Jurassic Coast in Dorset illustrates how geology and wave action produce cliffs, wave-cut platforms, arches and coves; Lulworth Cove is often used to show a concordant coastline where a band of weak clays behind resistant limestone has been eroded to form a cove, while nearby Durdle Door demonstrates arch formation in limestone where joints have been eroded. By contrast, the Holderness coast in east Yorkshire is one of Europe’s fastest-eroding coastlines because soft glacial boulder clay is exposed to powerful waves from the North Sea. Average long-term erosion rates along parts of Holderness are around one to two metres per year, with local variations and episodes of more rapid loss, and this makes it an excellent example of coastal retreat and the social and economic consequences that follow.

## Human activity and coastal management
Human activities alter coastal systems in many ways. Urban development, agriculture, ports and industry increase pressure on coastal land, often reducing natural sediment supply, changing drainage and increasing the vulnerability of people and property to erosion and flooding. Management of the coast ranges from hard engineering to soft engineering and policy options that accept change. Hard engineering such as sea walls, groynes and rock armour (rip-rap) provides immediate protection by absorbing or reflecting wave energy and by trapping sediment. These solutions can be effective locally but are costly to build and maintain, can require ongoing public expenditure, and often have knock-on effects elsewhere: groynes trap sediment that would otherwise feed down-drift beaches, increasing erosion further along the coast.

Soft engineering options, including beach nourishment and dune stabilisation, aim to work with natural processes by replacing sediment or encouraging natural buffers. Managed realignment, or managed retreat, is a planned approach that allows selected areas to flood or erode, reducing the costs of defending low-value land and creating new habitats such as saltmarshes that can absorb wave energy. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages for communities, the economy and the environment; what suits one stretch of coastline may be inappropriate on another.

Holderness provides a clear management story: many villages are protected with a mix of sea walls and groynes at places like Hornsea and Withernsea, while other stretches have been left to retreat. These decisions reflect balancing costs, property value and ecological considerations. In contrast, parts of the Jurassic Coast are protected and managed as a World Heritage Site, where conservation, regulated tourism and carefully chosen engineering work together to preserve important geological features while allowing natural processes to continue where possible.

## Fieldwork and skills for coastal investigations
Fieldwork at the coast focuses on measuring and explaining coastal processes and landforms in a real context. A coherent coastal investigation includes a clear enquiry question tailored to the location, quantitative methods such as beach profiling and sediment sampling, and qualitative methods such as observational records and photographic transects. Beach morphology can be recorded with simple transects that measure slope using a clinometer or ranging poles and tape; sediment characteristics are assessed by taking samples along a transect, measuring grain size by sieving or comparing to charts, and noting sorting and roundness. Recording the position of landforms and man-made features using maps and GPS links your field data to wider spatial patterns. Secondary sources such as British Geological Survey maps (BGS Geology of Britain) and historical Ordnance Survey maps allow you to relate landform distribution to rock type and to calculate rates of change by comparing coastline positions over time.

Analytical skills include processing field data into graphs and profiles, calculating average beach slopes or mean grain size, and using simple statistics to describe central tendency. For investigations into erosion rates you can calculate mean annual erosion by taking the distance of shoreline retreat from historical maps and dividing by the number of years, but be ready to comment on variability and the limitations of such averages. Geographical Information Systems (GIS), where available, are powerful for combining field observations, mapping, and secondary datasets. Fieldwork should also consider human interaction: interviews, surveys or structured observations help you assess how people use and respond to the coastal environment and its management.

## Exam technique
Exam success in the coastal section depends on clear use of case studies, accurate terminology and structured answers that match command words. For a “describe” question give clear observations and characteristics; for an “explain” question link causes to effects using process language (for example, hydraulic action undercuts cliffs leading to collapse). When asked to “assess” or “evaluate”, present a balanced argument that weighs strengths and weaknesses before reaching a justified conclusion. Always use a named example to support your points: for instance, describe Holderness when discussing rapid coastal retreat and management, or use Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door to illustrate concordant coastlines and erosional features. In extended answers, structure your paragraphs with a clear point, an explanation that links processes to outcomes, and specific evidence or data where possible. Annotated diagrams are often worth marks: a labelled cross-section of cliff retreat, a sketch showing longshore drift and spit formation, or an annotated map showing locations of defences can communicate ideas efficiently. Time management is vital; spend longer on higher-mark questions and make sure to include a brief conclusion in evaluate-type answers. Finally, practise using OS maps, BGS geology maps and simple calculations so you can apply skills confidently in exam contexts and in fieldwork-based questions.
