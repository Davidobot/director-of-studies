# Fieldwork methods and geographical investigations (Edexcel 1GB0) (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview of the fieldwork requirement and purpose
Fieldwork is central to Edexcel GCSE Geography B (1GB0). It gives you the chance to apply classroom theory to real places, test hypotheses, collect primary data and practise the skills of a geographer. The specification requires two separate investigations carried out outside the classroom and school grounds: one physical investigation (either coastal change and conflict or river processes and pressures) and one human investigation (either dynamic urban areas or changing rural areas). These must be planned so that classroom learning and practical field experiences reinforce one another. Centres must record their fieldwork on the Pearson Fieldwork Statement to confirm that students have taken part; failure to submit this form can be treated as malpractice. In the exams, questions about fieldwork appear in Paper 2 (UK Geographical Issues), and examiners may assess your understanding of at least two stages of geographical enquiry across your investigations.

## Planning fieldwork: questions, location and logistics
Successful fieldwork starts with a clear enquiry question that can be investigated within the constraints of time, safety and available equipment. Your question should be focused and feasible: for example, “How effective are hard and soft defences at slowing coastal retreat at Site X?” for a coastal study, or “How does water velocity and channel shape vary downstream on the River X?” for a fluvial study, or “How does environmental quality vary between the inner city and a suburban area of City Y?” for an urban investigation. Choice of location should link to the topic knowledge you are developing in class and to accessible secondary sources such as geology maps, flood-risk maps or census data. Practical planning also includes arranging transport, permissions, first-aid cover and contingency plans for poor weather. A written risk assessment must be completed and communicated to students and supervisors; it should consider site-specific hazards, appropriate clothing, emergency contacts and any special needs of group members. Teachers and students should also consider ethical issues when surveying people, ensuring consent and anonymising responses where appropriate.

## Methods for collecting quantitative field data
Quantitative methods give numerical evidence that can be measured, compared and analysed statistically. In coastal work this might include measuring beach profile through transects using a ranging pole, tape and clinometer, collecting pebble size with a sieve and measuring mean particle size, or calculating rates of erosion using multi-year data points and mean annual retreat. In river investigations quantitative methods commonly include channel cross-section measurement using tapes and metre rules, flow velocity measurement with a flowmeter or float and timer to calculate discharge, and simple sediment sampling. In urban and rural studies environmental quality indices (EQI) provide a repeatable numerical score for factors such as litter, noise, green space and traffic. Whatever the context, careful sampling design is essential: choose a systematic, random or stratified sampling approach appropriate to your question, state your sample size and justify how you controlled for bias. Record raw measurements clearly and include units and method notes so that your data are reproducible.

## Methods for collecting qualitative field data
Qualitative methods capture perceptions, descriptions and contextual detail that numbers alone cannot show. Typical qualitative approaches include structured or semi-structured questionnaires, interviews with local residents or managers, observational checklists, field sketches and photographic transects. In coastal management studies you might interview a local authority officer about defence costs and maintenance, or collect residents’ perceptions of flood risk. In urban quality-of-life investigations, short street interviews can reveal how different groups experience the city. When designing questionnaires, aim for clarity, neutrality and a manageable number of questions so respondents can answer quickly and accurately. Always pilot your questionnaire before the main field trip. Qualitative data are valuable for explaining the why behind quantitative patterns and for assessing the social and economic context of environmental change.

## Secondary data, maps and digital tools
Fieldwork should be supported by secondary sources, and the specification lists examples for each investigation: a geology map (for coastal studies), an Environment Agency flood-risk map (for river studies), and census or ONS neighbourhood statistics (for human investigations). Ordnance Survey maps at 1:25 000 and 1:50 000 scales are particularly useful for locating features, determining relief, measuring distances and producing cross-sections. GIS and online mapping tools let you overlay data, create flow-line maps, visualise spatial patterns and produce map-based evidence in reports. Satellite images and historic maps help to show change through time, and the use of GPS supports accurate location recording. When you use secondary data, note its source, date and limitations; cross-check where possible and use it to place your primary data in a wider spatial and temporal context.

## Processing, presenting and analysing fieldwork data
Processing field data means cleaning raw measurements, calculating summary statistics and producing effective visualisations. Numerical skills you are expected to use include calculating mean, median, range, percentage change and rates of change, drawing and interpreting scatterplots and trend lines, and constructing and reading hydrographs. Presentations might include annotated maps, cross-sections derived from contour interpretation, bar charts, histograms with equal class intervals, pie charts and proportional flow-line maps. GIS outputs and satellite images can be annotated and used alongside hand-drawn graphs. Analysis should move beyond description: explain patterns using geographical theory, physical processes or socio-economic context. For example, link increased channel width and discharge downstream to tributary inputs and geology, or interpret lower EQI scores in inner-city areas in terms of deprivation indices and land use. When evaluating correlations, comment on strength, possible causation versus coincidence, and the reliability of your sample and instruments.

## Evaluation, conclusions and communicating findings
Evaluation is a required element of fieldwork and often gains marks in longer exam questions. A good evaluation acknowledges the strengths of your investigation, identifies limitations and proposes realistic improvements. Limitations to discuss include sampling errors, small sample sizes, instrument precision (for example an imprecise clinometer or human error in timing floats), timing of fieldwork (seasonality or weather effects), access issues and the influence of external variables you could not control. Improvements might involve increasing sample size, using more precise instruments (e.g. flowmeter instead of float), adding control sites, or repeating data collection in different seasons. Conclusions should directly answer your original enquiry question, be supported by evidence and link to wider geographical concepts or case studies. When producing a fieldwork report, write clearly and structure it with an introduction to the question and location, methods with justifications, results with clear figures, analysis linking to theory, and a reflective evaluation. Remember that exam answers also reward clear use of specialist terminology and accurate spelling and grammar; Paper 2 allocates up to four marks for SPaG.

## Exam technique
In the exam you will face a range of fieldwork-related questions: short multiple-choice, data interpretation, calculations, and extended writing worth 6, 8 or 12 marks. Read the question carefully and note the command word. For describe questions give focused factual accounts. For explain questions link cause and effect and use geographical processes to justify your points. For assess and evaluate questions weigh evidence, consider alternatives and reach a supported judgement. For method questions, be explicit: say what you measured, how you measured it, where and when you measured it, why your sampling was appropriate and how you reduced error. For example, when asked to explain how you would measure beach profile, outline the transect technique, give equipment, state systematic sampling at set intervals, describe replication and mention safety and access considerations. When asked to analyse results, quote figures or trends from your data, use statistics to support claims, and link findings to relevant theory or case study knowledge. For the longer decision-making question in Paper 3 the examiner expects balanced consideration of environmental and social impacts, comparison of options and a justified recommendation that demonstrates awareness of consequences. Finally, manage time so you can plan, write and check your answers; use clear paragraphs, include relevant place names and theory, and ensure your conclusion directly answers the question.
