# Plate tectonics, earthquakes and volcanoes (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## The Earth’s internal structure and the source of plate motion
Understanding plate tectonics begins with the layered structure of the Earth. From the outside in, the crust and rigid uppermost mantle (the lithosphere) float on a hotter, weaker zone called the asthenosphere. Beneath this lies the deeper mantle and the core, where heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements drives convection. This internal heat causes slow but powerful movements in the mantle; those convective flows, together with slab-pull and ridge-push forces, drive the horizontal movement of lithospheric plates. Visualising a cross-section of the Earth helps: the crust forms the thin outer skin, the mantle behaves like a very slow-moving solid that can flow over geological time, and the core supplies the thermal energy that keeps the system moving. These motions are the fundamental cause of earthquakes and many volcanic eruptions, so a clear grasp of the layered structure and the idea of mantle convection is essential for explaining why tectonic hazards occur where they do.

## Types of plate boundaries and the features they create
Plate boundaries are locations where most tectonic activity is concentrated, and each type produces characteristic processes and landforms. At divergent boundaries, plates move apart and magma rises to create new oceanic crust along mid-ocean ridges; these settings are associated with gentle, volcanic activity and shallow earthquakes. Convergent boundaries see plates moving together. When an oceanic plate meets a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate subducts beneath the continental plate, forming deep ocean trenches, volcanic mountain chains and powerful, often explosive, volcanism. Ocean-ocean convergence produces island arcs. When two continental plates collide, neither readily subducts; instead, crust crumples and uplifts to form large mountain ranges, with shallow but frequently strong earthquakes and little volcanism. Conservative or transform boundaries occur where plates slide past one another. These are typified by strike-slip faults such as the San Andreas Fault; they produce severe earthquakes but no volcanoes. Hotspots, where a plume of hot mantle rises beneath a plate, can create chains of volcanoes far from plate margins, with the Hawaiian Islands being a classic example.

## Volcanoes: magma types, eruption styles and volcanic landforms
Volcanic behaviour depends on the chemistry of the magma, its temperature and gas content. Basaltic magmas are hot, low in silica and relatively fluid; they tend to produce gentle, effusive eruptions that pour out lava to build broad shield volcanoes, as seen in Hawaii. Andesitic and rhyolitic magmas are cooler, higher in silica and more viscous; they trap gases and are prone to explosive eruptions that generate ash columns, pyroclastic flows and volcanic bombs. Stratovolcanoes, common above subduction zones, are steep-sided and explosive, capable of producing devastating pyroclastic density currents and widespread ash fall. Volcanic hazards include lava flows, ashfall that disrupts air travel and agriculture, pyroclastic flows that destroy everything in their path, volcanic gases that can be toxic, and lahars—rapid mudflows caused when ash mixes with water. Over time volcanic activity also creates useful landforms and fertile soils, and volcanic regions can supply geothermal energy. Understanding the relationship between plate boundary setting, magma type and eruption style helps explain why some volcanoes are persistently active and hazardous while others are more benign.

## Earthquakes and tsunamis: origin, measurement and effects
Earthquakes occur when stress along faults or within the crust is released suddenly, sending seismic waves through the ground. The focus is the point within the Earth where rupture begins; the epicentre is the point on the surface directly above it. Earthquakes vary in depth and magnitude; shallow earthquakes near the surface often cause more damage locally than deeper events of the same magnitude. The size of an earthquake is quantified using magnitude scales. Historically the Richter scale was used, but geologists now prefer the moment magnitude (Mw) scale for large events because it more accurately reflects the total energy released. The intensity of shaking and damage at different places is expressed using scales such as the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale, which is based on observed effects rather than energy release. When undersea earthquakes cause a significant displacement of the sea floor, the resulting disturbance can generate tsunamis: long-wavelength waves that travel fast across deep ocean and increase dramatically in height when they reach shallow coastal waters. Tsunami waves can flood low-lying coasts many kilometres inland and are responsible for some of the deadliest secondary impacts of earthquakes.

## Impacts of tectonic hazards: primary and secondary effects, and vulnerability
Tectonic hazards produce a wide range of primary and secondary impacts that affect property, livelihoods and the environment. Primary impacts include ground shaking, surface ruptures, volcanic eruptions and the immediate destruction they cause. Secondary effects often magnify the disaster: tsunamis, landslides, flooding, fires sparked by ruptured gas lines, soil liquefaction in waterlogged sediments, and outbreaks of disease in the aftermath. The human cost of an event depends crucially on vulnerability and resilience. Wealthier, developed countries may experience strong earthquakes but suffer lower death rates because of strict building codes, effective emergency services, early-warning systems and well-rehearsed evacuation plans. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan illustrates this contrast: despite advanced monitoring and preparedness that reduced casualties relative to the event’s size, the combination of a very large earthquake and a massive tsunami still caused extensive damage and a nuclear accident. In contrast, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti shows how weak infrastructure, high population density in vulnerable areas and limited emergency capacity can turn a moderate-to-strong earthquake into a catastrophe with huge loss of life and long-term humanitarian crisis. Understanding these differences is central to evaluating risk and management strategies.

## Predicting, monitoring and managing tectonic hazards
Predicting exact timings of earthquakes remains beyond current science, but forecasting and monitoring can reduce impacts. Volcanoes generally give more warning signs than earthquakes: patterns of increased seismicity, ground deformation measured by GPS or tiltmeters, and changes in gas emissions often precede eruptions, allowing for evacuations. Seismograph networks detect seismic waves rapidly and contribute to earthquake early-warning systems that can provide seconds to minutes of advance notice for imminent shaking—enough time to shut down infrastructure or trigger automated safety responses. Satellite imagery, InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and remote sensing help map ground deformation and eruption plumes. For coastal risks, tsunami warning systems combine seismic data and sea-level monitoring to issue alerts. Long-term management focuses on reducing vulnerability: enforcing earthquake-resistant building design and land-use planning to avoid high-risk zones, public education and regularly practiced drills, effective emergency response and stockpiling of supplies, and investment in resilient infrastructure such as seawalls and appropriately sited shelters. In some places, engineered defences and community-led preparedness combine to reduce risk, while in others the costs or environmental trade-offs of hard engineering require alternative strategies such as managed retreat or stricter zoning.

## Case studies that illustrate contrasting risks and responses
Case studies help turn theory into tangible examples. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan was a magnitude 9.0 event, one of the largest recorded, which generated a devastating tsunami and a nuclear meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. Japan’s meticulous preparedness—strict building codes, tsunami walls, early-warning systems and organised evacuations—saved many lives, yet the scale of the tsunami overwhelmed defences and exposed vulnerabilities in spaced planning for nuclear facilities. In contrast, the 2010 Haiti earthquake (around magnitude 7.0) caused catastrophic damage and very high mortality because of poor construction standards, dense settlement in vulnerable urban areas, and limited emergency capacity. Volcanoes offer further contrasts. The 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens in the United States was highly explosive, producing a lateral blast and pyroclastic flows that illustrated the power of andesitic stratovolcanoes. The 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption in Iceland was relatively small by volcanic standards but produced an ash cloud that disrupted European air travel for days, demonstrating how volcanic hazards can have global economic impacts even when direct human casualties are limited. Using at least one example from a developed country and one from an emerging or developing country is advisable for exam answers, because it enables direct comparison of impacts and management.

## Exam technique
When answering questions about plate tectonics, earthquakes and volcanoes, begin by identifying the command word and planning your response so it matches the required focus. For 'describe' questions state clear features or processes; for 'explain' questions link causes and consequences; for 'assess' or 'evaluate' questions balance advantages and disadvantages before making a reasoned judgement. Always use accurate terminology such as lithosphere, asthenosphere, subduction, magma viscosity, epicentre, focus, moment magnitude and pyroclastic flow. Where appropriate, include brief, clearly labelled sketches or describe diagrams to show processes like subduction, mantle convection or the structure of a volcano; these support points and can gain marks. Use at least one named case study in detail and, where higher marks are available, compare two contrasting examples (one developed and one developing/emerging) to show understanding of how impacts and management differ. For extended answers structure paragraphs with a clear point, explanation, evidence from your case study, and a link back to the question. In evaluation questions, consider short-term and long-term responses, technological and social measures, and end with a concise conclusion that weighs up the evidence. Remember that up to four marks may be awarded for the quality of written communication, so write clearly, check spelling of key terms and avoid vague statements. Practising interpretation of cross-sections, world maps of plate boundaries and seismic data will also help you use evidence effectively in exams.
