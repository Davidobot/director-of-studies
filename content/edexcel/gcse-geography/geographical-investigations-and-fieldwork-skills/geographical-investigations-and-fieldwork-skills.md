# Geographical investigations and fieldwork skills (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## What this topic covers and why fieldwork matters
Fieldwork is where classroom knowledge meets the real world. In this specification you will carry out at least two fieldwork visits outside school to contrasting environments, normally one physical (a river or a coast) and one human (a central/inner urban area or a rural settlement). The aim is to develop the full enquiry cycle: formulating questions, choosing methods, collecting and combining primary and secondary data, presenting and analysing findings, drawing conclusions and reflecting critically on methods and results. Fieldwork is not an add‑on; it is assessed directly in Paper 3 and underpinning evidence from your investigations is required when you answer questions about UK challenges. Learning how to plan and evaluate investigations is a key part of “thinking like a geographer” and of applying geographical knowledge to contemporary problems.

## Planning an investigation: questions, hypotheses and sampling
Good fieldwork begins with a clear, focused question or hypothesis that can realistically be investigated at your chosen site. Questions should link to the physical or human processes you have studied in Components 1 and 2, but be narrow enough to be answerable within the constraints of time, equipment and location. Deciding on a sampling strategy is also crucial. Systematic sampling along a transect, stratified sampling across different land uses, or random sampling within a defined area each have strengths and weaknesses in terms of representativeness and logistics. Consider sample size so your results are reliable, and think in advance about possible sources of bias. A risk assessment and consideration of ethical issues — for example when surveying people — must be part of planning. Work with your teacher to choose secondary sources you will use to place your primary data in context, for example geology maps, flood maps, census outputs or long‑term climate records.

## Physical environment methods: rivers and coasts
When you study a river, you are expected to collect at least one quantitative measure and at least one qualitative record. Typical quantitative methods include measuring channel width, depth and velocity to calculate discharge, using either current meters or simpler approaches such as the float method combined with cross‑sectional area. Qualitative recording might take the form of annotated photographs and field sketches that document channel landforms, bank materials and vegetation. For coastal investigations the quantitative requirement commonly involves measuring beach morphology and sediment characteristics using transects, profile levelling and pebble counts or sieve analysis. Qualitative observations are used to record coastal landforms, evidence of erosion or deposition and human interventions such as sea defences. In both environments keep careful, dated and geo‑referenced records; noting tidal state at coasts or recent rainfall for rivers is essential because these factors strongly affect processes and results.

## Human environment methods: urban and rural fieldwork
Investigations in central or inner urban areas require at least one qualitative method, for example environmental quality surveys, and one quantitative method to measure land use or flows, such as land‑use mapping, pedestrian counts or traffic surveys. In rural settlement work you will typically combine qualitative techniques — interviews or questionnaires to capture residents’ views on change — with quantitative measures of movement through a settlement, types of land use, or house age and condition. For urban and rural enquiries, use observational transects, photographs and GIS where possible to link patterns to processes. Secondary sources such as Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, historical maps and planning documents are especially useful for interpreting change in population, services and housing over time.

## Using maps, GIS and secondary data effectively
Secondary data and mapping are central to good fieldwork. Geological maps, for example from the British Geological Survey, will help you explain why a coast is eroding rapidly or why a river channel changes along its length. Environment Agency flood maps and long‑term rainfall records put local flood risk into context. GIS is invaluable because it allows you to combine layers (elevation, land use, flood zones, transport links) and to produce clear maps for your report and exam answers. When using secondary sources be critical: check dates, resolution and whether the data represent the area you investigated. In the exam you will be expected to refer to both your primary fieldwork data and appropriate secondary evidence to support conclusions about UK challenges such as managing flood risk, conserving landscapes or responding to population change.

## Processing data and presenting findings
The quality of your data processing and presentation makes the difference between description and analysis. Present your numerical data using appropriate graphs and diagrams: bar charts for categorical comparisons, line graphs for change over time, scatter plots with lines of best fit for bivariate relationships, and cumulative frequency or box plots where distribution matters. For river studies hydrographs and cross‑section diagrams are essential; for coastal work a beach profile drawing with pebble size distributions shows morphology clearly. Photographs and annotated sketches are not decoration — they provide qualitative evidence that should be linked to quantitative findings. Apply basic statistical measures where useful: mean and median to summarise central tendency, range or interquartile range to show spread, and percentage change or rates (for example mean annual erosion rates) to compare change. Always show workings for calculations in an exam or fieldwork write‑up, and be cautious when inferring causation from correlation.

## Analysis, evaluation and making conclusions
Analysis should move beyond description to explain patterns in terms of processes and human interactions. Use your fieldwork knowledge alongside theory from the specification: link river channel changes to discharge, sediment load and valley gradient; relate coastal recession to geology, wave type and human defences; explain urban patterns through migration, economic change and planning policy. Conclusions should directly answer your original question and refer to the evidence you collected, including any unexpected results. Critical evaluation is required: reflect on the limitations of your sampling, possible measurement errors, temporal constraints (a single visit versus long‑term trends) and the reliability of secondary data. Suggest concrete improvements to your methodology and, where relevant, propose recommendations for local stakeholders such as landowners, local authorities or community groups.

## Practical considerations, safety and assessment requirements
Fieldwork must take place outside the classroom and school grounds and is authenticated by a Fieldwork Statement completed by your centre. Failure to return this statement can be treated as malpractice, so ensure teachers complete and submit it on time. Health and safety planning and risk assessments are not optional; they are integral to responsible fieldwork. Consider weather, tides, traffic and site access, and ensure parental consent and insurance arrangements are in place. The specification requires a minimum range of methods for each chosen environment: for rivers one quantitative discharge method and one qualitative landform record; for coasts one quantitative beach morphology method and one qualitative landform record; for urban and rural options similar minimums for qualitative and quantitative methods, plus use of at least two secondary sources for human investigations. Remember that fieldwork does not have to be in the UK, but examinations will always frame fieldwork questions in a UK context.

## Exam technique
Paper 3 assesses your ability to apply fieldwork experience and UK knowledge to practical scenarios. The paper is 1 hour 30 minutes and contains three sections: a choice of physical environment questions, a choice of human environment questions, and a section on UK challenges which draws on the wider course. Expect a mix of question styles from short multiple‑choice and calculation items to 8‑mark and 12‑mark extended writing tasks. Read each question carefully and pay attention to command words: identify asks for brief recall, describe requests characteristics, explain requires reasons and processes, and evaluate or assess demands judgement linked to evidence. In calculations always show your working and include units. For extended answers structure your response so that the first paragraph directly answers the question, the middle paragraphs develop linked points with evidence drawn from your fieldwork and secondary sources, and the final paragraph gives a clear, justified conclusion. Use specific examples and named locations where appropriate to demonstrate depth of understanding. When analysing data, compare figures explicitly (for example, “mean pebble size at Site A was 25 mm, compared with 10 mm at Site B, suggesting…”) and be cautious about over‑claiming causation from short‑term data. Leave time to check spelling, punctuation and specialist terminology because up to four marks are awarded for accurate written communication. Finally, when reflecting on methods in the exam, be honest about limitations and suggest realistic improvements — showing awareness of sampling, equipment accuracy and time constraints will score well.
