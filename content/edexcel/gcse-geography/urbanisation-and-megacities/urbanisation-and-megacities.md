# Urbanisation and megacities (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## The global rise of cities and the definition of a megacity
Over the last four decades the world has become increasingly urban. Since around 1980 the proportion of people living in towns and cities has risen substantially, driven by both natural increase and migration, and projections suggest that urban populations will continue to grow through the twenty‑first century. Geographers use the term megacity for an urban area with a population of over 10 million; these huge cities are now common in Asia, Africa and Latin America and often dominate their national economies and politics. Understanding the scale and pace of urbanisation helps explain why some places face intense pressure on housing, services and the environment, while others benefit from economic dynamism and improved opportunities. For GCSE study you should be able to describe global trends, locate regions where rapid urban growth is concentrated and explain the basic meaning of terms such as urbanisation, urban primacy and megacity.

## Why cities grow: processes behind urbanisation
Cities grow for a combination of demographic, economic and social reasons. Rural‑to‑urban migration is a major driver in developing and emerging countries: people move to cities seeking jobs, better education and health services, or to escape agricultural hardship. Natural increase — when birth rates exceed death rates in a young urban population — also contributes to growth. At the same time, globalisation and economic change have concentrated jobs, finance and services in urban centres. Transnational corporations, improvements in transport and communications, and investment in infrastructure make cities attractive locations for business. Political and historical factors such as colonial-era development, national capital location and government policy can accelerate concentration of people and resources in one city, producing dominant primate cities that overshadow other urban centres. These causes interact: for example, an expanding manufacturing zone and a new port may draw migrants, increasing demand for housing and services and further stimulating urban growth.

## How megacities are organised and how land use changes
As cities expand they change in predictable ways that can be identified on maps and satellite images. A typical urban structure includes a Central Business District (CBD) with high land values and commercial activities, inner-city areas often with older housing and mixed uses, suburbs with residential and retail development, and an urban–rural fringe where new housing estates, industrial parks and leisure facilities appear. Spatial change occurs through processes such as suburbanisation, where people and businesses move to the outskirts; deindustrialisation, where older factories close or relocate; and, in some contexts, regeneration, where derelict zones are redeveloped for new housing, cultural or business uses. In many megacities urban growth is rapid and often unplanned, producing sprawling suburbs and peri‑urban zones whose pattern is best observed with historical maps and GIS. Interpreting satellite imagery and calculating rates of growth from population data are useful skills to show how land use has changed over time.

## The urban economy: formal and informal sectors, and opportunities
Urban areas are economic engines, offering a wide range of formal jobs in services, manufacturing and public administration, but in many developing and emerging megacities a large informal sector exists alongside the formal economy. Informal employment includes street markets, small-scale manufacturing, domestic work and recycling. These activities provide livelihoods for millions but are often precarious, lacking social protection and regulated working conditions. For many migrants to megacities the informal sector is the first source of income while they seek more secure jobs. At the same time, megacities create opportunities: better access to education and healthcare, specialised services and cultural life, and economies of scale that can attract investment. The balance of these opportunities and constraints varies by city and by neighbourhood; understanding the local economic structure is essential when evaluating quality of life or policy responses.

## Why quality of life varies within a megacity
One of the defining characteristics of megacities is extreme spatial inequality. Within a single urban area you can find affluent neighbourhoods with secure housing, good schools and reliable services located close to deprived informal settlements or slums where residents lack piped water, sanitation and secure tenure. These contrasts arise from historical patterns of land ownership and investment, differences in connectivity and accessibility, selective provision of infrastructure, and rapid in‑migration that outstrips the capacity of formal housing markets. Physical factors, such as steep or flood‑prone land, also channel poorer residents into marginal areas because these plots are cheaper. Social and political factors such as discrimination, weak governance and corruption may perpetuate exclusion. When studying a megacity case study you should be able to explain specific reasons for spatial variations in quality of life, describe typical characteristics of wealthier and poorer areas, and use quantitative and qualitative evidence—such as census data, surveys of environmental quality, or photographs of housing—to support your explanation.

## Challenges megacities face: housing, services and environment
Rapid and concentrated urban growth brings multiple challenges. Housing shortages are common, leading to overcrowding and the growth of informal settlements with insecure property rights. Basic services such as clean water, sanitation, electricity and healthcare can be patchy or absent in poorer districts. Transport systems often become congested, creating long commutes and air pollution. Waste management is a persistent problem when municipal systems cannot cope with the volume of refuse, giving rise to open dumps and health risks. Environmentally, megacities may suffer from local pollution hotspots while their aggregate consumption contributes to global issues such as greenhouse gas emissions. Flood risk is often heightened by development on floodplains and loss of natural drainage. When answering questions on challenges, link physical geography (flood risk, landform constraints) with human geography (poverty, governance) to show how problems are interconnected.

## Managing megacities: top‑down and bottom‑up strategies for sustainability
Managing the pressures of megacities requires a mix of city‑wide policies and community‑based initiatives. Top‑down, government-led strategies can include investments in mass transit (metros, Bus Rapid Transit systems) to reduce congestion and pollution, large-scale water supply projects, formal housing programmes and planning regulations to control land use. These interventions can deliver rapid change at scale but risk being expensive, sometimes displacing vulnerable residents and failing if local needs are not understood. Bottom‑up and NGO-led approaches focus on incremental, community-driven improvements: slum upgrading projects that provide secure tenure, communal sanitation and paved paths; microfinance schemes to support small businesses; and participatory planning that involves residents in decision making. A balanced approach often works best. Successful examples include projects that combine infrastructure investment with community participation so that improvements are technically robust and socially acceptable. In evaluation, consider costs and benefits, equity outcomes, feasibility, and long‑term sustainability, along with potential trade-offs between economic growth and environmental protection.

## Fieldwork and geographical skills for studying urban areas
Understanding urban processes is reinforced by practical fieldwork and data skills. In urban investigations you will typically collect both quantitative data—such as environmental quality scores, traffic counts and measurements of housing density—and qualitative evidence, including interviews, perception surveys and photographic records. Fieldwork tasks might examine how quality of life varies between streets, test hypotheses about the relationship between accessibility and land value, or assess the impact of a regeneration scheme. Complementary secondary sources include census data, local plans, satellite imagery and GIS layers showing land use. Presenting findings effectively requires clear maps, annotated photographs, graphs showing trends and reasoned analysis that links data to geographical theory. Be aware of health and safety considerations, sampling methods and how to reflect critically on the limitations of your data and methods; evaluative reflection is an assessment focus in Paper 2.

## Exam technique
When answering exam questions on urbanisation and megacities, use a case study you have prepared in detail and weave it into your answers. For short questions use precise terminology and include one or two specific facts or figures to support your point. For 'explain' questions follow the structure of a claim, a development that links cause and effect, and an example. For 8‑mark and 12‑mark extended writing questions plan before you write: make a short plan that lists the points you will make and the evidence you will use. Use the PEEL approach—Point, Explain, Evidence, Link—so each paragraph makes a clear argument supported by specific detail from your case study. Always answer the command word: 'assess' requires weighing pros and cons and judging their importance, while 'evaluate' asks for a reasoned conclusion after reviewing evidence. For questions that ask you to make decisions or justify a strategy, compare alternatives, discuss likely impacts on people and the environment and then reach a supported recommendation. Remember that up to four marks across papers are awarded for spelling, punctuation, grammar and use of specialist terms, so write clearly and include accurate vocabulary such as urban primacy, informal sector, peri‑urban, and slum upgrading. Manage your time so you allocate sufficient minutes to extended answers, and practise writing concise, well‑structured paragraphs under timed conditions to improve fluency and confidence in the exam.
