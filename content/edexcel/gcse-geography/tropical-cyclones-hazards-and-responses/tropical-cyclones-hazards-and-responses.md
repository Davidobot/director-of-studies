# Tropical cyclones: hazards and responses (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## What is a tropical cyclone and where do they occur?
A tropical cyclone is a large, rotating storm system that forms over warm tropical oceans and is powered by heat and moisture from the sea. In different parts of the world these systems are called hurricanes (Atlantic and Northeast Pacific), typhoons (Northwest Pacific) or simply cyclones (Indian Ocean and South Pacific), but they share the same basic structure: a calm eye at the centre, an eyewall of the most intense winds and rain, and spiral rainbands extending outwards. Tropical cyclones form in the tropics, typically between about 5° and 30° north and south of the equator, because the Coriolis force away from the equator is needed to create the rotation. They are seasonal: the Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November, the North-West Pacific activity is year-round but peaks in late summer, and the Indian Ocean and South Pacific have their own seasonal peaks. Understanding where and when they form is the first step in assessing the hazard they pose to people and places.

## How tropical cyclones form and develop
Formation begins with a pre-existing low-pressure disturbance over warm ocean water, usually with sea-surface temperatures above about 26–27°C. Warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface, condenses and releases latent heat, which warms the surrounding air and lowers surface pressure further. This encourages more converging air at the surface, and, provided wind shear is low (so the storm can stay vertically aligned), the system can organise into a rotating tropical cyclone. The cyclone draws energy from the ocean, and its central pressure falls as winds intensify. Rapid intensification can occur if ocean heat content is high and atmospheric conditions are favourable.

The internal structure includes the eye, eyewall and rainbands. The Saffir–Simpson scale is commonly used to describe hurricane/typhoon intensity in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific; it is based on sustained wind speed and ranges from Category 1 (least severe on the scale) to Category 5 (most severe). However, damage depends on a combination of wind, rainfall and storm surge rather than wind speed alone. Cyclones weaken when they move over cooler water, encounter strong wind shear, or move over land where the moisture supply is cut off.

Tracks of tropical cyclones are controlled by larger-scale atmospheric features such as the subtropical ridge, trade winds and mid-latitude westerlies. El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other climate modes influence seasonal activity and the typical tracks of storms, which is why some years bring more storms to particular regions than others.

## Main hazards from tropical cyclones and their impacts
Tropical cyclones pose several interrelated physical hazards. Extreme winds can destroy buildings, uproot trees and damage infrastructure. Intense rainfall often causes freshwater flooding inland, and prolonged heavy rain on saturated slopes can trigger landslides. Perhaps the most devastating coastal hazard is the storm surge: a rise in sea level caused by strong onshore winds and low pressure that can flood low-lying coastal areas, sometimes cutting off evacuation routes and causing many fatalities. Coastal inundation is made worse where the continental shelf is shallow, where the coastline funnels water into bays or estuaries, or where sea level is already high.

Secondary impacts can be long-lasting. Flooding and structural damage disrupt housing, transport, power and water supplies, while contamination of drinking water and overcrowded shelters increase the risk of disease. Agriculture, fisheries and tourism can suffer major economic losses. The social impacts are uneven: vulnerable groups—poorer households, those living in informal settlements, the elderly and people with limited access to transport—are at greater risk of injury, displacement and long-term livelihood loss.

Historic examples help to illustrate these hazards. Typhoon Haiyan (Philippines, 2013) combined an extremely powerful storm with a very large storm surge and steep coastal profiles to cause massive coastal inundation, widespread destruction of houses and thousands of deaths. Hurricane Katrina (USA, 2005) showed how catastrophic flooding after levee failures can devastate urban areas and how social vulnerability affects survival and recovery. Bangladesh’s 1970 cyclone had an enormous death toll because of a high storm surge and little early warning or shelter; improvements since then—early warning systems and cyclone shelters—have greatly reduced mortality in more recent storms.

## Why vulnerability and impacts differ between places
The severity of impacts from a tropical cyclone depends not only on the storm’s physical characteristics but also on human factors. Physical vulnerability varies with location: low-lying coastal plains and river deltas are especially susceptible to storm surge and flooding, while steep tropical islands and mountain fringes are more prone to landslides during heavy rain. Socio-economic vulnerability is equally important. Wealthier countries generally have stronger buildings, better infrastructure, more resources for forecasting and evacuation, and insurance systems that speed recovery. In contrast, developing and emerging countries often have large populations living in poorly constructed housing, in informal settlements on hazardous land, and with limited access to early warning and emergency services.

Governance and preparedness matter. Effective early warning systems, evacuation plans, public education and disaster response capacity reduce casualties dramatically. The distribution of aid, the speed of emergency response and the resilience of local economies determine how quickly communities recover. Long-term factors such as land-use planning, coastal defences, building codes and poverty reduction all influence how destructive a cyclone will be for people and infrastructure.

## Preparing for and responding to tropical cyclones
Preparation and response operate at several levels, from global to local. Modern forecasting uses satellites, ocean buoys, radar and aircraft reconnaissance to monitor storms and predict their tracks and intensity. Accurate forecasts combined with timely public warnings are central to reducing loss of life. Evacuation plans that identify safe routes and shelters, public education about risks and drills, and clear communication channels save lives.

Engineering responses include hard defences such as seawalls, storm surge barriers and elevated housing, which can protect specific places but are expensive and sometimes environmentally damaging. Soft and nature-based approaches—restoration of mangroves, dunes and coral reefs—can reduce wave energy and storm surge locally and provide sustainable protection for coastal communities. Building design and land-use planning are vital: elevated houses, cyclone-resistant construction, and avoiding development in the most hazardous zones reduce risk. Economic tools such as insurance and contingency funds help recovery, and international aid often supports emergency relief and rebuilding.

Effectiveness varies. Bangladesh provides a strong example of life-saving preparation: after the catastrophic cyclones of the 1970s, investment in early warning systems, community shelters and coordinated evacuations has cut death tolls in subsequent major cyclones even though economic damage still occurs. In the United States, Hurricane Katrina exposed weaknesses in infrastructure and emergency planning in New Orleans, leading to changes in flood defence investment and evacuation planning; Hurricane Sandy later prompted further improvements in surge protection and urban resilience planning. The Philippines faces recurring large cyclones and, while warning systems exist, high population densities on vulnerable coasts and the rapid intensification of some storms can still overwhelm local coping capacity. When evaluating responses in an exam, consider both immediate life-saving measures and longer-term, sustainable strategies, and weigh costs, social equity and environmental impacts.

## How climate change affects tropical cyclones
Climate change is already altering the risks associated with tropical cyclones and is projected to continue doing so, though some aspects remain uncertain. Warmer seas provide more energy and moisture, so storms are expected to produce heavier rainfall and, in many regions, to reach higher maximum intensities; the proportion of very intense storms (Category 4–5) is likely to increase. Sea level rise makes storm surge more destructive because a higher baseline means that the same surge reaches further inland. There is less consensus about whether the total number of cyclones will increase globally; some models suggest fewer storms overall but greater intensity. Changing atmospheric circulation patterns may also alter where cyclones form and their tracks in some ocean basins. When discussing climate change in answers, be clear about the difference between increased intensity and uncertainty in frequency and distribution, and use examples of observed changes in rainfall or storm surge impacts to support your points.

## Teaching clarifications and useful examples
When studying tropical cyclones, it helps to link theory to named events and to develop a pair of contrasting case studies: one from a developed country and one from a developing or emerging country. Use the Philippines (Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda, 2013) or Bangladesh (1970 cyclone and later improvements) as examples of high human vulnerability but also of successful long-term preparedness measures. Use the USA (Hurricane Katrina, 2005) or Hurricane Sandy (2012) as developed-country examples that highlight urban vulnerability, infrastructure failure and the role of insurance and state capacity in recovery. In lessons, practise interpreting satellite images, storm-track maps and data on wind speed, pressure and storm surge. Be comfortable calculating wind category from given wind speeds and explaining why a given coastal profile or bathymetry will amplify surge. When discussing management, balance hard engineering, soft engineering and community-based approaches, and be ready to judge their social and environmental trade-offs.

## Exam technique
Always start answers by directly addressing the question and using a named case study when asked for examples. For "describe" questions, focus on clear, factual statements about features or processes. For "explain" questions, link causes and effects logically: state a cause, explain the process, and show the consequence. For "assess" or "evaluate" questions, weigh different points and reach a supported judgement; compare short-term and long-term effects, or compare management options. In extended writing tasks (for example 8-mark and 12-mark questions), structure your answer with a short introduction, two or three developed paragraphs, and a concluding judgement. Use numbers or specific details from case studies to support points—such as approximate death tolls, examples of storm surge heights, or named responses—because evidence strengthens explanations. When asked to compare a developed and a developing country, consider physical exposure, socio-economic vulnerability, preparedness systems, and recovery capacity. Remember to use specialist terminology (eyewall, storm surge, Saffir–Simpson scale, early warning system) and check spelling, punctuation and grammar as four marks are awarded for SPaG. In data-based questions, describe the pattern shown, explain possible causes and include an evaluative comment about reliability or limitations. Practise answering past-style questions using your two case studies so you can quickly deploy relevant facts and balanced analysis under exam conditions.
