# UK landscapes and geology (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## An overview of the UK’s physical landscape and why geology matters
The landscapes of the UK are the product of long geological histories and the ongoing interaction of physical processes and human activity. Beneath the surface, a mix of sedimentary rocks such as chalk and sandstone, igneous rocks such as granite and basalt, and metamorphic rocks such as schists and slates determine the broad pattern of uplands and lowlands. Upland areas are commonly underlain by harder igneous and metamorphic rocks that have resisted erosion, producing rugged relief such as the Scottish Highlands and parts of the Lake District. Lowland basins tend to sit on younger, softer sedimentary rocks that weather more easily into gentler hills and plains, as seen across much of eastern England. Understanding rock type, geological structure and past tectonic events is essential because these factors control the shape of the land, the drainage patterns of rivers, the distribution of soils and vegetation, and the suitability of places for farming, settlement and infrastructure.

## Rock types, structure and how they control landscape form
Sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks each have characteristic strengths and weaknesses that influence landscape development. Chalk and sandstone, typical sedimentary rocks, often form cliffs, rolling downs and fertile soils where they are widespread, while basalt and granite form resistant uplands with steep slopes and blocky scree. Metamorphic rocks such as schists and slates, altered under heat and pressure, commonly form folded and fractured landscapes with thin soils. The way rocks are layered and faulted — their structure — also matters: concordant coastlines, where rock layers run parallel to the shore, tend to produce coves and narrow inlets, whereas discordant coastlines, where different rock types are exposed along the coast, produce alternating headlands and bays. Joints and faults create lines of weakness that can be exploited by erosion and weathering, producing features such as cliffs, caves and waterfalls. Geology therefore provides the template upon which weather, water, ice and humans act to produce the landscapes you will study.

## Coastal landscapes and processes: how the coastline changes
Coasts are active environments where waves, tides and weathering shape landforms and where human activity often concentrates. The suite of coastal processes includes weathering, mass movement, erosion by hydraulic action, abrasion, attrition and solution, longshore drift transporting sediment along the shore, and deposition forming beaches, spits and bars. Wave type influences whether a coastline is erosional or depositional: destructive waves with strong backwash tend to erode and steepen profiles, while constructive waves build beaches. Geological structure controls where headlands and bays form, and features such as caves, arches, stacks and wave-cut platforms develop through focused erosion on weak points. The UK’s varied coastline provides many clear examples: the chalk cliffs near Dover and the white headlands of southern England contrast with the resistant basalt columns of the Antrim coast and the extensive depositional features of Chesil Beach. Human responses to coastal erosion and flooding range from hard engineering such as sea walls and groynes to softer approaches such as beach nourishment and managed retreat; each has costs and benefits and can change sediment patterns further along the coast.

## River landscapes and processes: from source to sea
River systems change character along their course as a result of changing gradient, discharge and the size and shape of transported sediment. In the upper course a river tends to be steep, narrow and dominated by vertical erosion; interlocking spurs, waterfalls and gorges are typical landforms. In the middle course lateral erosion and transport create meanders and point bars, while in the lower course deposition builds floodplains, levees and deltas where the river meets the sea. The physical processes at work include weathering, mass movement, erosion by hydraulic action and abrasion, and transport by traction, saltation, suspension and solution. Rivers are also strongly affected by short-term weather events such as storms and prolonged droughts, and by climate patterns that control seasonality and long-term discharge. Human activities such as urbanisation, agriculture and river channel modification alter runoff, sediment supply and flood risk. Flood management options, from hard engineering like dams and channelisation to soft approaches like floodplain zoning and washlands, illustrate trade-offs between protecting people and maintaining natural fluvial processes. The River Severn and the River Thames are useful UK examples to explain channel changes, flood histories and management responses.

## Glaciated upland landscapes: the legacy of ice
Much of the UK’s upland character was shaped during the Quaternary glaciations when valley glaciers and ice sheets sculpted mountains and lowlands. Glacial erosion by plucking and abrasion carved classic features such as truncated spurs, corries (cirques), arêtes and U-shaped glacial troughs, while deposition produced ground and terminal moraines as well as drumlins and crag-and-tail features. Many present-day upland environments are relict glaciated landscapes: they continue to experience frost weathering, soil movement and mass movement, but the major sculpting was ancient. The Lake District, Snowdonia and parts of the Scottish Highlands show textbook glacial landforms that are often used as case studies. Human activity in these areas — from hill farming and forestry to the development of reservoirs and renewable energy projects — must balance economic needs with conservation and the maintenance of fragile upland soils and habitats.

## Human impacts, management and sustainability in UK landscapes
Human activity has been a powerful force in changing UK landscapes over centuries. Agriculture has shaped lowland mosaics of hedges, fields and woodlands, while industrial development and urban expansion have transformed river valleys and coastal zones. Land use change, deforestation and resource extraction have altered biodiversity and ecosystem services. In coastal and river settings, engineered defences change sediment movement and can transfer erosion problems elsewhere. In uplands, tourism brings economic benefits but also erosion and pressure on services. Sustainable management requires understanding the interactions between people and the environment, and applying approaches that consider economic, social and environmental outcomes. In practice, this means evaluating cost-benefit balances for coastal defences, weighing the benefits of water storage and hydro schemes against ecological impacts, and using planning to concentrate development on brownfield sites rather than greenfield land. Case studies are central to answering exam questions: a UK city study will illustrate urban processes, while named coastal, river or upland examples should be used to explain formation and management. When studying case studies, be clear about the location, the key physical and human factors involved, the management choices made, and the evidence of success or failure.

## Fieldwork and geographical skills you must master
Fieldwork brings the textbook to life and is a compulsory part of the course. For physical environments you will carry out investigations such as measuring river discharge or sampling beach sediments and recording landforms; for human environments you will collect qualitative and quantitative data about land use, services or flows of people. Effective fieldwork requires clear enquiry questions, systematic sampling, careful recording, and the use of secondary sources such as geology maps or flood risk maps. In the classroom and exams you will be expected to interpret and present data using maps, cross-sections, GIS outputs, graphs and statistical summaries. Key map skills include interpreting geological maps and OS maps at 1:25 000 and 1:50 000 scales, drawing simple geological cross-sections to relate rock type to relief, and recognising landforms on maps and aerial photographs. Mathematical skills include constructing and interpreting hydrographs, calculating means and rates of change (for example mean erosion rates), and using measures of central tendency to summarise field data. Practice converting field data into clear graphs and annotated sketches, and always relate your analysis back to geographical theory and your case study evidence.

## Exam technique
Success in the exams depends on combining knowledge, place-specific evidence and clear writing. Always read the question carefully and note command words: identify or state require brief factual answers, describe asks you to outline features or steps, explain and suggest require reasons and links, and assess, discuss or evaluate require balanced argument and judgement. For short answer questions, include key terms and be precise. For calculations and graph questions show your working clearly and label axes. Extended answer questions (8 and 12 marks) should be structured: start with a clear line of argument, develop points with specific evidence or examples (named UK locations or case studies are essential), explain the significance of each point, and then reach a concise conclusion that answers the question. Use specialist terminology correctly to gain SPaG marks and, when appropriate, include a simple annotated diagram to support your explanation; diagrams should be clearly labelled and directly linked to your text. For fieldwork-based questions, refer to your fieldwork enquiry question, describe methods (quantitative and qualitative), summarise key findings with data or trends, analyse causes and implications, and reflect on limitations, reliability and how methods could be improved. Time management is crucial: allocate time proportional to marks, leave a few minutes to check spelling and to ensure all parts of the question have been answered. Finally, practise past papers under timed conditions, revise core case studies with their physical and human contexts, and be ready to apply your knowledge to unfamiliar contexts using the same processes and terminology you have learned.
