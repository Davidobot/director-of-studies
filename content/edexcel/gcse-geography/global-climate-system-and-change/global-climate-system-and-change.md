# Global climate system and change (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: why the global climate system matters
The global climate system is the web of interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere, land surface and biosphere that together determine the climate we experience. Understanding this system helps explain why different parts of the planet have very different climates, why weather and longer-term climate change occur, and why human societies and environments are affected in particular ways. At GCSE level you need to be able to see the climate system both as a set of physical processes that move heat and moisture around the planet and as a context for hazards and long-term change that affect people’s lives, food production, water supplies and ecosystems. The topics you study range from the simple interpretation of climate graphs to the planetary-scale consequences of rising greenhouse gas concentrations and to the local impacts of extreme weather such as tropical cyclones.

## How heat is transferred around the Earth: atmospheric circulation and ocean currents
The Sun is the primary source of heat for the climate system, but the way that heat is distributed is governed by atmospheric circulation and by ocean currents. Where solar radiation is strongest near the equator, the air warms, rises and flows poleward aloft; cooler air returns toward the equator near the surface. These broad movements are organised into three circulation cells in each hemisphere – the Hadley, Ferrel and Polar cells – and their associated belts of high and low pressure determine global patterns of rainfall and aridity. For example, the persistent high pressure around 30 degrees north and south is linked to many of the world’s deserts, while tropical low-pressure zones are associated with heavy rainfall and storm systems.

Oceans act as giant heat reservoirs and conveyors. Surface currents such as the Gulf Stream carry warm water from the tropics toward higher latitudes, moderating climates along western European coasts and contributing to milder winters than would be expected at those latitudes. Cold currents have the opposite effect. The interaction between wind-driven circulation, ocean temperature, and sea-surface evaporative processes also influences atmospheric humidity, cloud formation and storm development. Learning to link maps of pressure, winds and ocean currents helps to explain why some regions are dry and others wet, and why climate can vary markedly from place to place.

## Natural causes of past climate change and the evidence we use
Climate has not been constant through Earth’s history. Natural drivers operate over a range of timescales and magnitudes. Changes in Earth’s orbit and tilt (the Milankovitch cycles) alter the distribution of sunlight on the planet over tens to hundreds of thousands of years, driving the sequence of ice ages and interglacials during the Quaternary. Volcanic eruptions can inject aerosols into the stratosphere, temporarily cooling the planet for a few years. Large asteroid impacts are rare but can cause abrupt, catastrophic climatic disruption. Small variations in solar output and longer-term plate tectonic shifts that alter ocean circulation have also influenced past climates.

To reconstruct past climates scientists rely on proxy evidence. Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica preserve layers of snow compacted over hundreds of thousands of years along with trapped air bubbles that record past greenhouse gas concentrations. Tree rings provide high-resolution records of annual growth that reflect temperatures and rainfall. Sediment cores, pollen records and historical documents also contribute to understanding regional climate change, for example allowing comparisons of UK climate since Roman times. Being able to explain how each type of evidence is used and what it can tell us about past temperatures and atmospheric composition is an important part of the inquiry into past climate variability.

## Human-driven climate change and future projections
Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities have added large quantities of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels for energy, changes in land use including deforestation, and agricultural practices are the main sources. These gases strengthen the natural greenhouse effect, trapping more outgoing longwave radiation and causing a net warming of the planet. Observational evidence shows a clear global temperature rise, warming oceans, shrinking Arctic sea ice and mountain glaciers, and rising sea levels. Changes in the frequency and intensity of some extremes, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall, have also been linked to human-caused warming.

Future climate projections use climate models driven by different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. These projections show a range of possible temperature and sea-level outcomes to 2100 and beyond. The spread of projections reflects both uncertainty about future human emissions and scientific uncertainties such as climate sensitivity (how much the climate responds to a given forcing), how ice sheets will behave, and how feedbacks within the system (for example, changes in cloud cover or carbon uptake by forests) will play out. Interpreting projection graphs is a key skill: you should be able to describe trends, compare scenarios, and explain which processes lead to uncertainty. Real-world responses to these projections include international agreements to reduce emissions, national adaptation planning, and local mitigation measures.

## Extreme weather and hazards: tropical cyclones in a warming world
Tropical cyclones (also called hurricanes in the Atlantic and typhoons in the west Pacific) are powerful weather systems that form over warm ocean waters. They require a combination of warm sea-surface temperatures, sufficient Coriolis force to induce rotation, low vertical wind shear, and pre-existing disturbances to grow into organised cyclones. Structurally, they are characterised by intense low pressure at the centre, spiralling bands of deep convection and, in strong storms, a clear eye. Their seasonal distribution and typical tracks are set by regional sea temperatures and global circulation patterns.

Cyclones can cause multiple physical hazards simultaneously: destructive winds, intense rainfall leading to inland flooding, storm surges that inundate low-lying coasts, and landslides in hilly terrain where heavy rain destabilises slopes. The impacts on communities depend not only on the hazard but on vulnerability factors such as population density, housing quality, preparedness, and socio-economic conditions. Comparing events illustrates this: a similar-intensity storm can lead to very different outcomes in a high-income country with strict building codes and well-resourced emergency services, compared with a low-income country where many people live in informal housing and evacuation capacity is limited. As sea-surface temperatures rise, there is evidence that the most intense tropical cyclones are becoming stronger and that storms are able to produce heavier rainfall, although changes in frequency and global distribution are more complex and depend on regional factors.

## Preparing for and responding to tropical cyclones: management and examples
Management of cyclone risk combines forecasting, early warning systems, evacuation planning, engineered defences and longer-term land-use planning. Advances in satellite technology, numerical weather prediction and communication systems have greatly improved the lead time and accuracy of cyclone forecasts, allowing governments and communities to evacuate and prepare. Hard engineering solutions such as sea walls and storm surge barriers can protect key urban areas, while soft approaches including coastal wetlands restoration and planned retreat reduce exposure in a more sustainable way. The effectiveness of these measures varies with the context: high-income countries may invest heavily in resilient infrastructure and enforce building standards, whereas low-income settings may rely more on community resilience, early warning improvements and international aid.

Illustrative examples are useful for understanding these differences. In developed settings, investment in levees, flood defences and well-coordinated emergency services can limit casualties, though property and economic losses may still be high. In some developing countries, despite improvements in forecasting, constraints in evacuation capacity and housing vulnerability can make storms far more deadly. Learning case studies such as a major hurricane or typhoon and assessing the mix of physical impacts and human responses helps build exam-ready explanations that link physical processes to social consequences.

## Earth's interior and tectonic hazards: why this matters alongside climate
Although tectonic processes are not part of the climate system, they are a parallel source of hazard and shape long-term environmental conditions. Heat generated by radioactive decay in Earth’s core drives mantle convection and plate tectonics. Plates move past, toward or away from each other at conservative, convergent and divergent boundaries, producing earthquakes, volcanoes and, in some cases, tsunamis. The type of plate boundary determines the characteristic hazards: subduction zones generate powerful earthquakes and explosive volcanic eruptions, mid-ocean ridges feature volcanic activity and sea-floor spreading, and transform faults produce large shallow earthquakes.

The human impacts of tectonic events vary according to preparedness, building standards, and emergency response capacity. Contrasting case studies — for example, a well-prepared, high-income country with strict building codes and rapid emergency response compared with a low-income country with weak infrastructure — show how physical magnitude does not alone determine human cost. For GCSE you will need to interpret cross-sections of the Earth, identify plate boundaries on maps, and explain primary and secondary hazards such as shaking, landslides and tsunamis, as well as evaluate methods of prediction, prevention and post-disaster management.

## Working with data and practical skills in climate study
A strong grasp of practical skills will support both fieldwork and exam questions. Being confident with climate graphs – reading temperature and precipitation patterns, identifying seasonal trends and anomalies, and comparing locations – is essential. Interpreting line graphs and bar charts that show long-term climate trends or sea-level rise requires attention to axes, units and timescales. When you study projections, note the scenario being used and whether the graph shows rates or cumulative change. GIS and satellite images are used to track cyclone tracks and to map changes such as forest loss or coastal erosion; practice linking visual evidence to written explanations.

Other practical skills include simple calculations such as estimating rates of change (for example mean rates of coastal erosion), using storm-surge and wind data to understand cyclone intensity categories, and handling population or economic data to discuss vulnerability. In fieldwork contexts you should be able to design a clear question, choose quantitative and qualitative methods, record and present data using appropriate graphs or maps, and draw balanced conclusions that reflect limitations of the data. These skills are assessed across the course and are useful in writing well-supported, evidence-based answers.

## Exam technique
When answering questions about the global climate system and change, always begin by reading the question carefully and identifying the command word – whether it asks you to describe, explain, assess or evaluate. For description, focus on the main features in clear, factual sentences. For explanation, link cause and effect clearly: for example, show how increased greenhouse gas concentrations lead to more outgoing longwave radiation being trapped and therefore higher global temperatures. In extended writing tasks plan your answer briefly, use specific examples (for instance a named cyclone or a case study of a country’s response), and structure your paragraphs so each has a clear point, evidence and explanation.

Use data in the question to support your points: when a graph or map is provided, quote relevant figures and trends and explain what they mean in context. When asked to assess or evaluate, compare alternative viewpoints or management options, weigh their advantages and disadvantages, and give a reasoned judgement that reflects the evidence. Keep scientific terms precise but avoid jargon without explanation; where specialist terminology is used it can score additional marks for accuracy. Finally, practice past-paper questions under timed conditions, use mark schemes to understand exam expectations, and review feedback so you can develop clearer, more evidence-led answers in the real exam.
