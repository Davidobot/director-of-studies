# Changing cities: UK and global case studies (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Urbanisation: global patterns and why cities grow
Urbanisation is the long-term shift of people from rural to urban areas and it is one of the defining trends of the 21st century. Different parts of the world urbanised at different times and rates. Many developed countries completed rapid urban growth in the 19th and 20th centuries during industrialisation, while many emerging and developing countries have seen very fast urban growth since the mid-20th century as rural populations seek better jobs, education and services. The processes that drive urban growth include natural increase where birth rates exceed death rates, rural-to-urban migration driven by push and pull factors, and international migration related to trade, investment and conflict. Globalisation, improvements in transport and communications, and the rise of transnational corporations (TNCs) have concentrated economic activity and connectivity in cities, further reinforcing urban growth. The result is a wide variety of urban experiences: mature, regulated cities in developed countries; rapidly expanding megacities and primate cities in emerging economies; and smaller, growing regional centres in many developing countries.

## The UK urban landscape: patterns, processes and regional differences
The UK has a long history of urbanisation and today has a high proportion of people living in urban centres. Urban areas are unevenly distributed: the population is concentrated in the South East, the West Midlands and the North West, with London as a global hub. Regional differences in the rate and nature of urban growth reflect historical patterns of industry, transport links and economic policy. Processes such as suburbanisation, counter-urbanisation and recent waves of re-urbanisation have shaped city structures. Suburbanisation saw population and services move to the suburbs after World War II, enabled by car ownership and commuter rail, while counter-urbanisation has seen some people move to smaller towns and rural edges for lifestyle reasons. Re-urbanisation, evident since the 1990s, has brought people and investment back into city centres through regeneration, new housing developments and changes in retail and leisure. These processes create different urban zones—Central Business Districts (CBDs), inner-city areas, suburbs and urban-rural fringes—each with distinctive land uses, housing ages and social characteristics.

## Case study: a major UK city — Manchester
Manchester provides an accessible and exam-relevant example of how a UK city has changed. Its location in the North West of England on historic transport routes and near coalfields supported rapid industrial growth in textiles during the 18th and 19th centuries. Deindustrialisation in the late 20th century led to factory closure, job losses and social decline in some inner-city areas. Since the 1980s Manchester has pursued regeneration to transform its economy towards services, higher education, culture and media. Large-scale projects have converted former industrial zones into office, residential and leisure space, with landmarks of regeneration including Salford Quays and MediaCityUK. Population change in Manchester has been influenced by internal migration, international migration and the growth of the student population, producing diverse age and ethnic profiles across neighbourhoods. Manchester illustrates many exam themes: how global economic change causes deindustrialisation; how redevelopment can both improve the urban environment and widen inequalities; and how planning, transport improvements and cultural investment can support re-urbanisation. In considering Manchester it is useful to draw on Census and local authority data, maps and historic satellite imagery to show spatial patterns of change and to evaluate the success of strategies aimed at improving quality of life.

## Case study: a major city in an emerging/developing country — Lagos
Lagos in Nigeria is a contrasting case that helps explain rapid urban growth in emerging economies. Once a colonial port, Lagos has become a megacity with a metropolitan population that makes it one of Africa’s largest urban areas. Its position on the coast and its connectivity by sea and road have attracted investment, manufacturing, services and migrants from rural areas. Lagos’s fast growth has created acute challenges: a shortage of affordable formal housing has produced extensive informal settlements such as Makoko, infrastructure and sanitation are under pressure, and transport congestion and pollution are persistent problems. Employment is often in the informal sector with under-employment and job insecurity common. Responses to these challenges have varied. National and local governments have pursued ambitious, often top-down, projects aimed at improving housing, transport and flood protection, while community-led, bottom-up initiatives have focused on improving local services and livelihoods. Schemes such as bus rapid transit (BRT) corridors and slum upgrading projects provide material for evaluating the strengths and limits of different approaches. Lagos highlights the unequal nature of urban development in emerging countries and the need to balance rapid economic growth with investment in infrastructure and social services.

## Urban processes that affect people and place: housing, services and inequality
Cities change through a combination of demographic, economic and social processes that have direct impacts on people’s lives. Migration alters the age structure and ethnic composition of urban neighbourhoods and creates demand for housing, schools and healthcare. Economic restructuring, such as the decline of manufacturing and the rise of service and knowledge sectors, changes employment patterns and can leave spatial concentrations of deprivation. Housing is a common flashpoint: demand for affordable homes can drive up prices in successful cities and force low-income households into the urban fringe or informal settlements, depending on the national context. Services and infrastructure—public transport, waste management, green spaces—are essential for quality of life; their unequal provision increases spatial inequality. Environmental pressures such as urban heat islands, flood risk on low-lying coasts or river floodplains, and air pollution interact with social vulnerability to intensify risk for particular communities. Understanding these processes requires combining quantitative measures, such as Census statistics and deprivation indices, with qualitative evidence from residents and local organisations.

## Fieldwork and geographical skills for studying cities
Fieldwork is an essential part of understanding urban change because it develops investigative skills and allows students to collect primary data that illustrate urban processes on the ground. Typical urban fieldwork tasks include land-use surveys to map functions across the city centre, environmental quality surveys to assess the condition of streets and open spaces, traffic and pedestrian counts to measure flows, and questionnaires or structured interviews to capture local views. Secondary data sources such as Census output area data, local authority plans, historical maps and satellite imagery enrich fieldwork and help place local observations in a wider context. Geographical skills that are especially useful include interpreting GIS maps and satellite images to measure spatial growth, using population pyramids and choropleth maps to analyse demographic patterns, constructing and interpreting graphs to show change over time, and applying cartographic skills to present and compare data. In the examination it is important to show not only the methods used but also to analyse and evaluate the reliability and limitations of your data, reflect on sampling choices and consider how your findings relate to theory and case study evidence.

## Planning and managing urban change: strategies and trade-offs
Cities are managed through a mixture of policy measures, private investment and community action, and strategies to improve quality of life come in top-down and bottom-up forms. Top-down interventions are typically led by national or local government or by large developers and can deliver rapid infrastructure, housing or flood defence projects. Examples include urban regeneration schemes that redevelop brownfield land, major transport investments such as light rail or BRT systems, and coastal defence works. Bottom-up approaches are often community-led, focusing on slum upgrading, local environmental improvements and small-scale economic development. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages: top-down projects can mobilise large sums of money and transform a cityscape but may displace existing communities and prioritise commercial interests, while bottom-up projects can be more responsive to local needs but lack the scale to address city-wide infrastructure deficits. Sustainable urban management requires a mix of policies that balance economic growth with environmental protection and social inclusion, such as prioritising brownfield redevelopment over greenfield expansion, improving public transport to reduce car dependency, and implementing inclusive housing policies that protect vulnerable groups.

## Exam technique
Success in the Changing Cities exam questions relies on combining factual case study knowledge with clear geographical reasoning and careful use of skills and evidence. Start each answer by quickly noting the command word and the required focus: identify and state need short factual answers, describe asks for characteristics or sequences, explain and suggest require reasons and linking of cause and effect, and evaluate or assess demand a balanced judgement. For shorter questions use precise terminology and, where relevant, include data or specific place names from your case studies. For 8-mark questions aim to make two or three developed points, each supported by specific evidence from your UK city or international case study, and finish with a short concluding sentence that answers the question. For 12-mark or larger evaluative questions structure your response with an introduction that defines the issue, a balanced discussion presenting reasons or arguments on both sides supported by case study evidence, and a reasoned conclusion that weighs the evidence and gives a judgement. Always link answers to place: avoid generic paragraphs by adding named example details, dates or figures where you can, and explain how these details support your argument. Use geographical terminology (for example: CBD, re-urbanisation, informal sector, ecological footprint) correctly; up to 4 marks are available across papers for spelling, punctuation, grammar and use of specialist terms, so write clearly and proofread. When maps, graphs or data are provided in the exam use them: describe patterns, calculate simple changes if asked, and integrate the evidence into your explanation. Time management is essential: read the paper first to allocate time to each section, tackle known shorter tasks quickly to secure marks, and reserve time to plan and revise your extended answers. Finally, practise writing synoptic paragraphs that link processes, impacts and responses at different scales so you can apply case study knowledge flexibly to unfamiliar contexts in the exam.
