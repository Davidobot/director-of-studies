# Resource management — energy and water (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Why resource management matters
Resources such as energy and fresh water are fundamental to how societies function. They power homes, industries and transport, and they support food production, sanitation and ecosystems. Their distribution is uneven across the globe: some places are rich in fossil fuels, rivers and rainfall, while others face scarcity. At the same time demand is rising because of population growth, urbanisation and higher living standards. This creates pressures that are physical, economic and political. Understanding resource management means recognising the causes of supply and demand imbalances, the environmental impacts of extracting and using resources, and the range of technological, social and policy responses available at local, national and international scales. For GCSE study it is useful to think in terms of patterns (where resources are found and used), processes (how resources are produced, transferred and consumed) and management (how people try to secure supplies and reduce harm).

## Energy resources: types, characteristics and the energy mix
Energy resources are often described as renewable or non‑renewable. Non‑renewable sources include coal, oil, natural gas and uranium for nuclear power; they form in geological time and are finite. Renewable sources — such as wind, solar, hydroelectricity and biomass — are continually replenished on human timescales. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. Fossil fuels are energy dense and historically inexpensive, but their extraction and burning release greenhouse gases and can damage landscapes and water quality. Nuclear power produces low carbon electricity in operation but presents challenges of radioactive waste and high capital costs. Renewables generally have lower operational emissions, but they require suitable sites, can be intermittent (sun and wind vary) and sometimes have local environmental or social impacts, for example the flooding of valleys for large dams or landscape concerns with onshore wind farms.

The concept of an energy mix explains how countries combine different sources to meet demand. The energy mix is shaped by resource availability, economic wealth, technology, infrastructure and policy priorities. In the UK the energy mix has shifted substantially over recent decades: coal use has declined, gas and renewables have grown, and there is increasing emphasis on offshore wind and energy efficiency. In many emerging economies the mix still contains a high share of coal but with rapidly increasing investment in solar and wind. Being able to describe and compare energy mixes is important for exam answers: it links physical resources to human choices and national strategies.

## Managing energy: technology, policy and stakeholder choices
Meeting energy demand safely and sustainably involves many tools. On the supply side, countries develop new generation capacity: offshore wind farms, large solar arrays, modern gas plants, nuclear reactors or hydroelectric schemes. Energy storage is increasingly important because it smooths out the variability of wind and solar; pumped‑storage hydropower and battery systems are common responses. On the demand side, energy efficiency measures, smart meters and changes in behaviour can substantially reduce consumption and peak loads. New technology such as smart grids helps balance supply and demand and enables distributed generation, where homes and businesses produce their own electricity.

Policy plays a central role. Governments may subsidise renewables, tax carbon emissions, support research or regulate markets. Different stakeholders — residents, environmental groups, energy companies, farmers and local councils — often hold opposing views. Fracking for shale gas illustrates how technical possibility meets social contest: it can boost domestic gas supplies but raises concerns about groundwater, surface disruption and induced seismic activity. International factors matter too. Energy security depends on imported fuels, global markets and geopolitical relationships, so nations often balance environmental goals against reliability and cost.

To make ideas concrete in exams, it helps to use named country examples. The UK provides a developed‑country case where policy has promoted large offshore wind farms, ambition to decarbonise electricity and investment in interconnectors to import or export power. An emerging country example is India where coal remains a major source of electricity but large solar programmes and renewable auctions have rapidly increased clean capacity; the country faces the twin challenge of expanding access and decarbonising a growing economy. When discussing management, always weigh costs and benefits: economic development, jobs and energy security on one side, and environmental impacts, long‑term sustainability and social acceptance on the other.

## Water resources: distribution, supply and patterns of use
Fresh water is unevenly distributed across space and time. Some regions have abundant rainfall and rivers year‑round while others face seasonal shortages or aridity. Water supply issues arise from natural causes — climate, geology and seasonality — and from human factors such as over‑abstraction, pollution and poorly maintained infrastructure. Consumption patterns also vary with development. In developed countries a larger share of water is used by industry and domestic consumption per person tends to be high, while in many developing countries agriculture accounts for the biggest proportion of water use and households may have limited safe access.

In the UK water availability varies regionally, with the wetter north and west supplying the drier and more populous south and east. Climate change and population shifts are increasing pressure on resources in some areas, and ageing pipes and leakage add to supply problems. Globally, water stress can be chronic where rainfall is low, or episodic where droughts interrupt supply. Understanding maps that show water availability, relative water stress and supply‑demand balance is a valuable skill for exams.

## Managing water: supply-side and demand-side strategies
Managing water sustainably requires both supply‑side and demand‑side approaches. Supply‑side measures include reservoirs, transfers between catchments, groundwater abstraction and desalination. Desalination provides reliable fresh water from the sea and has been widely used in arid countries, but it is energy intensive and expensive. Demand‑side measures consist of water metering, efficiency in homes and industry, fixing leaks, promoting water‑saving devices and reusing treated wastewater for irrigation or industry.

Case studies bring these ideas to life. Cape Town’s “Day Zero” drought in 2018 is a clear example of an emerging city facing acute water shortage. Faced with falling reservoir levels, strong public communication, strict household restrictions, rebates and emergency infrastructure such as temporary desalination plants and borehole drilling were deployed to avoid supply collapse. The response involved national and local government, residents and private companies and highlighted the importance of contingency planning and social behaviour change. In the UK, the southeast faces long‑term water stress driven by high demand, seasonal rainfall patterns and population growth. Responses include regional water transfers, leakage reduction schemes, increased metering, and investment in wastewater recycling. Both examples show that technical fixes work best when combined with demand management, clear governance and public engagement.

## Sustainability, trade‑offs and governance
Sustainable resource management is about balancing environmental protection, economic development and social equity. Policies that promote rapid renewable energy expansion can conflict with local landscape or biodiversity objectives. Large water infrastructure can displace people and alter ecosystems. The idea of Integrated Water Resources Management captures the need for coordinated planning across sectors and scales, incorporating scientific data, stakeholder views and long‑term planning. Similarly, energy planning increasingly requires consideration of carbon budgets and the need for a just transition that supports workers and communities affected by changes such as coal mine closures.

Conflict over resources often centres on who benefits and who bears the costs. For example, hydropower can supply clean electricity nationally while altering river ecosystems and affecting local livelihoods. Fracking might lower energy imports but raise ethical and environmental concerns locally. Managing these trade‑offs requires transparent governance, robust environmental assessment, and mechanisms to compensate or involve affected communities. Students should be able to describe these tensions and to evaluate different strategies by considering environmental impact, economic feasibility, social acceptability and political realism.

## How to learn this topic effectively
To revise resource management effectively, combine conceptual understanding with specific examples and data skills. Learn the definitions of key terms such as renewable, non‑renewable, energy mix and water stress, and be confident explaining physical processes like evaporation and hydrological cycles or the generation of electricity from wind or gas. Use named case studies so you can apply theory: for energy, the UK and an emerging economy such as India or Brazil provide contrasting contexts; for water, Cape Town and the UK southeast are useful. Practice interpreting and drawing simple maps, climate graphs and resource distribution diagrams, and prepare to calculate and compare trends from line graphs or to use simple percentage changes in your answers. Practice extended answers that move from factual description to explanation and then to judgement, supported by evidence. Finally, practise fieldwork methods and how findings might inform resource management so you can answer questions about practical investigation as required by Component 3.

## Exam technique
When you are answering Paper 2 Section C questions on resource management, it is essential to match your response to the command word. For describe and explain questions begin with a clear definition and then develop points that link cause and effect. For assess, discuss and evaluate questions you must do more: give balanced analysis, compare alternatives, weigh advantages and disadvantages and finish with a substantiated judgement. A useful structure for an 8‑mark question is to open with a concise definition or context, follow with two well‑developed paragraphs that explain causes or effects using named examples, and finish with a short evaluative conclusion that answers the question directly. For a 12‑mark question take slightly more time to develop three linked paragraphs and conclude by ranking the most important factors or offering a clear evaluative comment.

Always use specific named examples and place them in the correct development context (developed, emerging or developing country). Examiners reward precise terminology — use phrases such as energy mix, renewables, abstraction, desalination, leakage and water stress — and application of geographical skills such as interpreting maps or graphs where relevant. Remember that up to four marks are available for spelling, punctuation, grammar and specialist terms, so write clearly and check your sentences. If a question asks you to use data or a figure, make sure you refer to the source, extract key values and show any simple calculations or comparisons. Practice timing so that you can plan an answer, write clearly and leave time to proofread. Finally, when asked to evaluate, be explicit about criteria for judgement (for example cost, environmental impact, reliability and social acceptability) and use these criteria to reach a clear, supported conclusion.
