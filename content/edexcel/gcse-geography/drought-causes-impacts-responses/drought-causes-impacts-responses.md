# Drought: causes, impacts and responses (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## What is a drought and why it matters
A drought is a prolonged period of below-average precipitation that leads to a shortage of water for people, agriculture and ecosystems. Unlike a single dry spell, drought develops over weeks, months or even years and can affect large regions. It is important to see drought as a hazard that arises from a complex interaction of atmospheric conditions, land and water systems, and human behaviour. Droughts reduce crop yields, limit drinking water supplies, damage ecosystems and can trigger economic and social crises. For GCSE study it helps to think of droughts in three overlapping ways: meteorological drought (lack of rainfall), hydrological drought (reduced river flows and reservoir levels) and agricultural drought (soil moisture too low for crops). Understanding these differences makes it easier to interpret graphs and data in exam questions and to compare impacts and responses in different countries.

## The causes of drought
At the simplest level droughts begin with a deficit of rainfall. This may result from natural variations in the global circulation of the atmosphere. For example, changes to the position of high pressure systems, persistent blocking highs, or shifts in the jet stream can steer rain-bearing weather systems away from a region. Large-scale climate patterns such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also influence rainfall in many parts of the world: some El Niño events bring drought to eastern Australia and parts of Africa, while La Niña can produce dry conditions elsewhere. Over longer timescales, natural climate variability such as multi-decadal oscillations can make dry periods more likely in some regions.

Human activities both trigger and worsen drought. Climate change, driven by increased greenhouse gas emissions, is altering temperature and precipitation patterns and increasing evaporation, which can intensify drought conditions. Land-use change such as deforestation and inappropriate agricultural practices can reduce the capacity of the soil to store water and increase runoff, so less water is available during dry spells. Over-abstraction of groundwater and river water for irrigation, industry and domestic use lowers reservoirs and aquifers, turning a temporary dry period into a severe water shortage. Building dams and altering river flows upstream can reduce downstream water availability, increasing vulnerability to drought.

Some regions are naturally more prone to drought because of their position in the global circulation. Subtropical high-pressure belts, rain shadow areas, and continental interiors often receive low and variable rainfall and therefore face higher drought risk. However, where people concentrate and rely on water-intensive activities, even places with moderate climate can become highly vulnerable when human demand outstrips supply.

## Characteristics of drought and how it is measured
Drought is measured using a range of meteorological, hydrological and agricultural indicators. Meteorologists may use rainfall totals compared with long-term averages to identify deficits and calculate the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), which shows how unusual current rainfall is for a given period. Hydrologists watch river discharge, reservoir storage and groundwater levels. Agricultural drought indicators include soil moisture measurements and crop stress data. Modern monitoring also uses satellites to estimate soil dryness, vegetation health and reservoir areas, and GIS to map spatial patterns of water stress.

In classroom and exam practice students should be able to interpret graphs of rainfall trends and reservoir levels, describe patterns shown on drought maps, and calculate simple averages or percentage changes to show the severity of a drought. For fieldwork and case study work, hydrographs and multi-year rainfall charts are useful to show how a drought develops and how quickly water systems recover.

## Impacts on people and ecosystems
Droughts have a wide range of social, economic and environmental impacts that vary with a country’s level of development, governance and resilience. In developed countries the immediate impacts may include water-use restrictions, increased costs for food and energy, stress on water-dependent industries, and damage to river ecosystems and wetlands. For example, the United Kingdom experienced hot, dry summers with low river flows and hosepipe bans in 2018; although infrastructure and water networks limited the worst outcomes, agriculture and some ecosystems still suffered reduced yields and stressed habitats.

In emerging and developing countries the consequences can be much more severe. The Cape Town water crisis of 2017–2018 in South Africa is a useful recent example of an emerging country response. A multi-year reduction in rainfall, combined with increasing demand and poor planning in parts of the city, led to an acute water shortage and the highly publicised campaign to avoid “Day Zero”, when municipal taps would be switched off. Temporary rationing, strict water-use rules and emergency planning avoided the worst-case outcome, but the episode exposed inequalities in supply and the heavy reliance of many urban and rural communities on predictable rainfall. In the Horn of Africa, repeated droughts have caused crop failures and famines, with severe impacts on food security, livestock and livelihoods in parts of Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya. In these contexts the lack of alternative water sources, weaker infrastructure and limited financial resources mean long-term recovery and adaptation can be difficult.

Ecosystems suffer when drought reduces river flows and dries wetlands, harming fish and bird populations and reducing biodiversity. Prolonged soil moisture deficits increase the risk of wildfires and can lead to land degradation. When groundwater is overused, aquifers may decline or become permanently damaged by saline intrusion in coastal areas.

## Who is most vulnerable and why
Vulnerability to drought depends on exposure, sensitivity and capacity to adapt. Exposure refers to the physical likelihood of low rainfall in a place. Sensitivity covers how dependent people and ecosystems are on that water; for example, rainfed agriculture is highly sensitive, whereas irrigated farms may be less so but can contribute to long-term depletion. Capacity to adapt is about resources, technology and governance. Wealthier countries can invest in reservoirs, inter-basin transfers, desalination plants, leak detection and widespread metering to reduce demand. Poorer communities rely more on local water sources and are less able to afford substitutes, making them more vulnerable to food shortages, loss of income and health crises. Political instability and weak institutions also increase vulnerability, because effective early-warning, planning and emergency response systems tend to be weaker.

Teaching this topic is helped by comparing named places. In contrast to the UK or California, where infrastructure and insurance help manage impacts, drought in parts of sub-Saharan Africa often leads to humanitarian emergencies. That comparison is exactly the kind of material examiners expect when questions ask for reasons why impacts and responses vary by level of development.

## Responses: short-term management and long-term adaptation
Responses to drought operate at different timescales. Immediate short-term responses are designed to reduce demand and protect people. These include water-use restrictions, rationing, emergency water trucking, setting up communal collection points, public communication campaigns to reduce consumption and temporary subsidies for food or water. Technological responses such as desalination have been used in developed and emerging countries; for example, Australia and parts of the Mediterranean rely on desalination as a drought-proof supply, though cost and energy use are important trade-offs.

Long-term responses focus on reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience. These involve demand management through water-efficient appliances, widespread metering and pricing policies, leakage reduction in ageing networks, and promoting water conservation in agriculture with drip irrigation, crop choice and soil moisture-retaining techniques. Natural infrastructure approaches, including catchment restoration, reforestation and wetland protection, help store water and reduce runoff, improving resilience to dry spells. Managed aquifer recharge and the careful regulation of groundwater abstraction can sustain supplies, while inter-basin transfers and reservoir management can smooth seasonal variations. In developing contexts, community-level rainwater harvesting, small-scale storage and diversified livelihoods are vital adaptation measures because they are affordable and appropriate to local needs.

Governance and planning are critical. Effective drought preparedness includes early-warning systems based on rainfall and soil moisture monitoring, contingency plans for water allocation, and social safety nets for vulnerable households. International aid and NGO involvement often play a key role in humanitarian responses in developing countries, while in developed countries market mechanisms and regulation shape long-term water management.

## Measuring effectiveness and the role of data and skills
Assessing how well responses work requires data and geographical skills. Students should be comfortable interpreting bar charts and line graphs that show multi-year rainfall trends, reservoir storage percentages, and socio-economic indicators such as crop yields and unemployment during droughts. Mapping and GIS are used to show spatial patterns of water stress, while satellite images and remote sensing can track vegetation health and surface water extent. In exam answers, referencing concrete data—such as percentage fall in reservoir levels, number of people affected, or changes in crop production—strengthens explanations and supports judgements about the success of policies.

When studying case studies for exams, include both quantitative evidence (rainfall deficits, reservoir percentages, economic losses) and qualitative evidence (government strategies, community responses, media reports). Use AO1 to show knowledge of locations and processes, AO2 to explain how causes and impacts link together, AO3 to interpret and evaluate data and responses, and AO4 to describe techniques used to measure and manage drought. Practising with past data sets—drawing simple trend lines, calculating percentage changes and interpreting maps—prepares students to answer the kinds of questions set by Pearson Edexcel.

## Exam technique
For short-answer questions, begin by defining key terms and answering the command word precisely: identify, describe, explain or compare. For 8-mark and 12-mark extended questions, structure your response clearly. Start with a brief definition of drought, then outline the main causes, using a named example to illustrate each point. When the question asks about impacts or responses, explicitly contrast a developed country case with a developing or emerging country case to show differences in scale and capacity. Use specific evidence—figures, dates and named locations—to support your points and show understanding of geographic patterns and processes.

When asked to evaluate or assess, weigh strengths and weaknesses, consider alternative strategies and reach a reasoned conclusion. Use specialist vocabulary such as meteorological drought, hydrological drought, Standardised Precipitation Index, groundwater abstraction and managed aquifer recharge. In answers that involve data, refer to trends and calculate simple percentage changes where appropriate; annotate any graphs or maps if the paper provides them. Spend time planning a short paragraph structure: point, explanation, example, link back to the question. For fieldwork-related questions, mention methods that could be used to investigate drought (rainfall records, soil moisture probes, reservoir monitoring and interviews about water use) and reflect briefly on reliability and limitations of these methods.

Remember that up to four marks are awarded for spelling, punctuation and the use of specialist terminology, so write clearly, use paragraphs, and include accurate geographical terms. Practice past-style questions, use named case studies with precise facts, and always link causes to impacts and responses to outcomes when forming your conclusions.
