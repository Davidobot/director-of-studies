# Biomes, forests and conservation (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction to biomes and why they matter
A biome is a very large ecosystem shaped by climate, soils and living organisms, and is home to characteristic communities of plants and animals. At GCSE level you will study the major biomes such as tropical rainforests, temperate forests, grasslands, deserts and the boreal or taiga forest. Biomes are not isolated; they interact with the atmosphere, hydrological cycle and human society. Understanding biomes helps explain why people live where they do, how resources are provided, and why some environments are especially important for global wellbeing. Biomes supply goods such as timber, food and medicines, and provide vital services like carbon sequestration, water regulation and habitat for biodiversity. When biomes are damaged by human activity or climate change, the consequences are local, regional and global.

## Global distribution and the physical controls on biomes
The global pattern of biomes is closely linked to climate. Temperature and rainfall regimes, influenced by latitude and atmospheric circulation, determine whether an area develops as rainforest, desert or tundra. Tropical rainforests occur around the equator where high temperatures and high, year-round rainfall support evergreen, species-rich vegetation. Deserts form in areas of persistent high pressure and low precipitation, often on the western edges of continents and in subtropical latitudes. Temperate forests and grasslands occupy mid-latitudes where seasonal temperature change is greater, while the taiga dominates high northern latitudes with cold, long winters and short growing seasons. Local factors such as altitude, soil type, drainage and human land use can modify these broad patterns: mountain slopes produce zonation of vegetation with altitude, river floodplains support wetter communities than surrounding uplands, and soils rich in nutrients can increase plant productivity. For exam questions, be prepared to explain how one or two physical controls (for example precipitation and temperature) determine the location and characteristics of a chosen biome.

## Tropical rainforests: structure, functioning and importance
Tropical rainforests are among the most complex and productive biomes on Earth. Their vertical structure is clearly stratified into layers: emergent trees, canopy, understory and forest floor, and each layer supports different plants and animals adapted to those light and moisture conditions. Many rainforest trees have buttress roots for support in shallow soils, and leaves with drip tips to shed heavy rainfall. Rainforests are characterised by rapid nutrient cycling: warm, wet conditions accelerate decomposition, allowing nutrients to be quickly reabsorbed by roots and leaves. Despite often thin soils, the tight recycling of nutrients supports very high levels of biodiversity and complex food webs. For people, tropical rainforests provide food, medicinal plants, timber and cultural resources, and they play a major role in regulating the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide. Understanding the nutrient cycle and food web diagrams is essential when explaining why rainforests are so productive despite nutrient-poor soils.

## Threats to tropical rainforests and their consequences
Tropical rainforests face a range of direct and indirect threats. Direct causes of deforestation include commercial logging, clearing for subsistence and commercial agriculture (for example cattle ranching and soybean cultivation), expansion of oil-palm plantations, and infrastructure development such as roads and hydroelectric schemes. Indirect threats include rising global demand for biofuels and minerals, weak land tenure, and economic pressures that prioritise short-term gains over long-term ecosystem health. Climate change acts as an additional indirect threat by increasing the frequency of droughts and extreme events, which can stress tree communities and make forests more susceptible to fires and pests. The consequences of deforestation are profound: loss of biodiversity as specialist species lose habitat, increased carbon emissions from burning and decomposition, changes to local rainfall patterns and water cycles, soil erosion and declines in the availability of goods and services for local and indigenous communities. Examples you should know include the Amazon, where a mix of cattle ranching and soy has driven large-scale forest clearance, and Southeast Asia, where oil-palm expansion has been a major driver of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia. When answering exam questions, link causes to clear environmental and social impacts and include named examples to support your points.

## The taiga (boreal forest): characteristics, services and pressures
The taiga, or boreal forest, stretches across northern Canada, Russia and Scandinavia and is the world’s largest terrestrial biome. It is defined by long, cold winters and short, cool summers, with vegetation dominated by coniferous trees such as spruce, fir and pine. Adaptations include needle leaves and conical tree shapes that shed snow, while soils tend to be acidic with slow nutrient cycling, resulting in lower biodiversity and productivity than tropical rainforests. The taiga stores vast amounts of carbon in trees and soils (including peat in some areas), making it important for global climate regulation. Human activities that threaten the taiga include large-scale commercial logging for softwood and pulp, mining and fossil fuel extraction, forest fires that are increasing in extent and severity with warmer conditions, and pest outbreaks that can be exacerbated by changing climates. There are also conflicts over land use because many taiga regions are sparsely populated but rich in mineral and timber resources, creating tension between national economic development and conservation. In exam answers compare the resilience and recovery potential of taiga to that of tropical rainforests, and consider how management needs to reflect the biome’s low productivity and slow nutrient cycling.

## Conservation and sustainable management: strategies, trade-offs and examples
Conserving forests and biomes requires a mix of international agreements, national policies and local action because the drivers of change operate at multiple scales. International mechanisms include trade controls on endangered species through CITES and financial incentives such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) which aims to pay countries to keep forests standing by valuing carbon storage. National approaches range from protected area networks and national parks to sustainable forestry regulations and certification schemes like the Forest Stewardship Council, which encourages responsible timber harvesting practices. Locally, community-based forest management and alternative livelihood schemes, for example ecotourism or agroforestry, can provide income while reducing pressure to clear native forest. Restoration projects, including reforestation and afforestation, can help recover degraded land but must be carefully planned to restore native species and ecosystem function rather than creating monoculture plantations. Trade-offs are inevitable: protecting forests can limit short-term economic opportunities such as logging or agriculture, but allowing unregulated exploitation can lead to long-term loss of ecosystem services and cultural values. Real-world examples illustrate these trade-offs: Costa Rica has used payments for ecosystem services and ecotourism to reverse deforestation trends, while in parts of the Amazon and Indonesia enforcement problems, land-tenure disputes and global commodity demand have made conservation difficult. When evaluating approaches, consider effectiveness, cost, equity and long-term sustainability, and pay attention to the role of indigenous rights and local participation; secure land tenure and involvement of local people often make conservation more successful.

## Using geographical skills to study forests and biomes
Understanding and evaluating biomes relies on a range of geographical skills that you will be expected to use in the exam. Interpreting climate graphs helps explain why a biome exists in a particular location, while world maps and GIS outputs allow you to show the distribution of biomes and to track forest loss over time. Nutrient cycle diagrams and food webs are essential for explaining ecosystem functioning, and satellite imagery is invaluable for assessing recent deforestation and the effectiveness of management. Fieldwork and investigation skills are also relevant: quantitative measures such as tree density or soil sampling can be combined with qualitative interviews about local resource use to give a rounded picture of human–environment interactions. When you use skills in your answers, describe the data source briefly and explain what it shows: for example, “satellite images between 2000 and 2020 show a clear pattern of fragmentation along new road corridors, indicating how access encourages agricultural expansion.”

## Exam technique
Answering questions on biomes, forests and conservation requires clear knowledge, well-chosen examples and structured argument. For short questions use precise definitions and one or two linked points. For extended answers (8 or 12 marks), plan briefly, use paragraphing, and apply the PEEL approach: make a Point, give Evidence (a named example or data), Explain how it links to the question, and Link to the next point or provide a concluding judgement. Always use named examples—reference a specific rainforest (for example the Amazon, Congo Basin or Borneo) or a taiga region (Canada or Siberia) depending on the question. When asked to evaluate or assess different approaches, weigh up advantages and disadvantages and reach a reasoned conclusion that balances environmental, social and economic factors. In decision-making questions, show awareness of different stakeholders (local communities, national governments, TNCs, global institutions) and justify your preferred option with evidence from the sources or your case studies. Remember to include geographical terminology such as “nutrient cycling,” “ecosystem services,” “deforestation,” “REDD,” and “sustainable forestry,” because up to four SPaG marks are available for accuracy of spelling, punctuation and specialist terms. Finally, if a question provides data, integrate it: describe what the graph or map shows, use figures when they strengthen your point, and explain why the patterns matter for people and the environment.
