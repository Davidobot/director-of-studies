# Tropical cyclones — impacts and responses (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## What a tropical cyclone is and how it forms
A tropical cyclone is a large, rotating storm system that develops over warm tropical oceans. It has a clear internal structure: a calm, low-pressure eye at the centre surrounded by an intense eyewall of very strong winds and heavy rain, with spiral rainbands extending outwards. Formation requires a combination of favourable conditions. Sea surface temperatures need to be warm—typically above about 26.5°C—so that large quantities of heat and moisture are available to fuel convection. There must be a pre-existing low-pressure disturbance, sufficient Coriolis force to encourage rotation (which is why cyclones do not form on the equator), light vertical wind shear so the storm can build vertically, and high humidity in the mid-troposphere to sustain thunderstorms. As warm, moist air rises and condenses, latent heat is released, lowering pressure at the surface and drawing in more air; this positive feedback leads to rapid intensification for some storms.

Different regions use different names for the same phenomenon: hurricanes in the North Atlantic and east North Pacific, typhoons in the northwest Pacific, and simply cyclones in the Indian Ocean and southwest Pacific. Intensity is commonly described by wind speed and central pressure; the Saffir–Simpson scale classifies hurricanes into five categories based on sustained wind speed and indicates likely damage and storm surge potential. Forecasters also map tracks and use satellite imagery to classify the stage of development and issue warnings.

## Characteristics, hazards and immediate impacts
The main hazards associated with tropical cyclones are extreme winds, very heavy rainfall, storm surge, intense coastal flooding and secondary hazards such as inland flooding and landslides. Extreme winds can demolish poorly built structures, uproot trees and destroy power lines. Torrential rain over short periods leads to rapid river rises and flash flooding far inland from the storm’s landfall point; in mountainous areas, saturated slopes are prone to landslides. A storm surge—the dome of water pushed ashore ahead of the cyclone—can inundate low-lying coastal areas, causing the most severe loss of life and property damage. Beyond physical damage, cyclones interrupt services: electricity and water supplies fail, roads and bridges are damaged, communications are lost, and emergency services face great difficulty reaching affected communities.

Immediate impacts include casualties and injuries, destruction of homes and infrastructure, contamination of freshwater supplies by seawater and debris, loss of crops and livestock, and widespread displacement of people. Environmental impacts can be severe too: coastal erosion, damage to ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves, oil spills from damaged facilities and long-term salinisation of soils in inundated agricultural land.

## Patterns, frequency and links to climate change
Tropical cyclones tend to form in specific ocean basins where sea temperatures are high and atmospheric conditions are favourable, so their global distribution is uneven. The northwest Pacific is the most active basin, producing frequent typhoons that often affect the Philippines, Japan and China. The North Atlantic produces hurricanes that commonly affect the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern United States. Seasonal patterns matter: cyclone seasons occur when ocean and atmospheric conditions align, such as late summer and early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere.

Long-term trends are complex. Observations and climate models indicate that while the total number of tropical cyclones globally may not increase significantly, the proportion of very intense storms (the strongest categories) is likely to rise as oceans warm. Sea-level rise, a well-established consequence of global warming, makes storm surges more damaging because higher baseline sea levels allow surges to penetrate further inland. Warmer sea-surface temperatures can also increase the rainfall potential of cyclones, raising the risk of extreme flooding. These links mean that climate change is likely to increase cyclone impacts even if the frequency changes only modestly.

## Why impacts differ between developed and developing countries
The social and economic consequences of the same cyclone can vary greatly between countries depending on their level of development, governance and preparedness. In wealthier, developed countries the built environment often includes stronger building codes, better flood defences, extensive early warning systems and stronger emergency response capacities. As a result, while storms still cause significant economic damage in these places, loss of life is often lower relative to the scale of the event, and recovery is usually faster because of insurance systems, greater fiscal resources and resilient infrastructure.

By contrast, in developing or emerging countries the same cyclone intensity can produce much more severe humanitarian crises. Informal settlements on floodplains or coastal margins, poorly constructed housing, limited access to vehicles for evacuation, weak early warning and fewer resources for emergency response increase vulnerability. Infrastructure is more easily disrupted, health systems are fragile, and economic losses can push families into long-term poverty. The differential effect is not absolute: large storms striking wealthy cities have produced catastrophic impacts when defences are overwhelmed, and effective community measures in poorer nations can reduce vulnerability.

## Case studies that illustrate impacts and responses
When thinking about real-world examples, three events illustrate different contexts and lessons. Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) struck the central Philippines in 2013 as one of the most powerful tropical cyclones to make landfall. It produced devastating storm surge and wind damage across low-lying coastal towns. The rapid onset, combined with many communities living in exposed coastal areas and limited road access, amplified human losses and complicated immediate relief. Lessons from Haiyan include the critical value of clear, locally understood warnings, the protective role of coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, and the long-term challenge of rebuilding resilient housing and infrastructure.

Hurricane Katrina in the United States in 2005 demonstrates how a powerful storm can cause catastrophic consequences even in a wealthy nation when human decisions magnify vulnerability. The failure of flood defence systems, complex governance issues, and social inequalities in New Orleans led to major inundation and prolonged displacement. Katrina highlighted the importance of maintaining ageing infrastructure, the need for coherent emergency planning, and the social dimension of vulnerability.

Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi in 2019, showed how widespread flooding and riverine inundation can destroy crops and contaminate water supplies across a broad inland area, producing large humanitarian needs in countries with limited response capacity. International aid, coordination challenges and the risk of disease outbreaks were central to the response.

These cases underline that impacts depend not only on cyclone strength but also on location, timing, population density, preparedness, and pre-existing inequalities.

## Responses: forecasting, preparedness and immediate actions
Effective responses operate at several stages: pre-event preparedness, immediate emergency response and long-term recovery and adaptation. Forecasting and early warning are central to reducing loss of life. Modern meteorological agencies use satellites, reconnaissance aircraft in some regions, computer models and historical data to predict tracks and intensities; warnings issued through mobile messaging, radio, television and community networks give people time to evacuate or protect property. In many successful cases, timely evacuation orders and rehearsed shelter plans have greatly reduced fatalities.

Preparedness also includes building codes and land-use planning to avoid the most hazardous zones, public education about evacuation routes, pre-positioning of relief supplies and training of emergency services. In the immediate aftermath, search and rescue, emergency medical care, temporary shelter, water and sanitation and rapid restoration of critical infrastructure save lives and reduce secondary impacts. Coordination between local authorities, national governments, non-governmental organisations and international agencies is often required where the scale of damage exceeds national capacity.

## Long-term management and adaptation strategies
Long-term strategies aim to reduce risk and increase resilience. Structural measures include seawalls, levees and storm-surge barriers, and the reinforcement of buildings to withstand high winds. While these can be effective, they are costly and can give a false sense of security if not properly maintained or if design standards are exceeded by an extreme event.

Non-structural approaches are increasingly emphasised. These include early warning systems, land-use controls that restrict development in high-risk floodplains, relocation of the most vulnerable communities, improved building regulations and insurance schemes to spread financial risk. Ecosystem-based approaches are important too: protecting and restoring mangroves, coral reefs and coastal wetlands can reduce wave energy and storm surge impacts while providing livelihoods. Recovery and reconstruction provide opportunities to build back better: using improved designs, elevating homes, and restoring key services reduces future vulnerability.

Different stakeholders have different roles. Governments provide policy, planning and emergency funding; local authorities implement evacuation and temporary shelter; communities often provide the first response; international organisations and NGOs supply expertise, logistics and funding when national systems are overwhelmed. The balance between top-down and bottom-up approaches matters; community-led, participatory planning is more likely to succeed over the long term in many contexts.

## Monitoring, technology and skills useful for the exam
Satellite imagery, radar and remote sensing are indispensable for tracking cyclones, mapping flooded areas and coordinating relief. GIS and storm-track maps support the analysis of exposure and vulnerability and allow responders to prioritise locations for aid. Social media and crowdsourced reports increasingly provide near-real-time information on impacts and needs; however, these must be critically evaluated for accuracy. In the classroom and in exams, you may be asked to interpret maps, satellite images or graphs showing cyclone tracks, rainfall totals or storm surge heights, so practice extracting and explaining what such data show. The specification expects students to use sources such as satellite images and socio-economic data to assess impact and to use storm surge and weather data to calculate magnitude measures like the Saffir–Simpson category.

When linking cyclones to other geographical themes, be prepared to explain how changing climate modifies hazard profiles, how economic development and land use affect vulnerability, and how fieldwork or secondary data could be used to study coastal or river responses after a storm.

## Exam technique
When you answer exam questions on tropical cyclones, start by making sure you understand the command word. For short-answer questions use clear, precise definitions and include key features such as warm sea temperatures, low wind shear and the eye/eyewall structure. For describe and explain questions, sequence your points logically: describe the hazard, explain the processes causing it, and then give the consequence or reason. In comparative questions, explicitly compare developed and developing contexts with specific examples—state which country or event you mean and focus on differences in preparedness, infrastructure and recovery capacity. For 8‑ and 12‑mark extended responses, plan a short structure: introduce the topic, develop two to three well-explained points with evidence or case-study detail, and finish with a judgement or conclusion that weighs the relative importance of the factors you discussed. Use geographical terminology accurately to gain SPaG and technical marks, and where appropriate refer to data, maps or monitoring methods to support your points. Finally, remember to answer the question set, keep responses focused on the issue asked, and, for higher-mark questions, integrate knowledge of processes, impacts and responses rather than listing facts.
