# Glaciated upland landscapes and processes (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview of glaciated upland landscapes
Glaciated upland landscapes in the UK are relict features shaped mainly during the Quaternary ice ages. Although active glaciers are now restricted to small cirque glaciers and ice caps in parts of Scotland, much of the upland scenery of northern and western Britain — the Scottish Highlands, the Lake District, Snowdonia and upland parts of northern England and Wales — carries the imprint of past glaciation. These landscapes are characterised by steep-sided valleys, high ridges, rock-strewn slopes and a mix of erosional and depositional features. To understand them we must link rock type and structure, past ice movement and present-day weathering and human use. Geology controls the skeleton of the landscape: harder igneous and metamorphic rocks tend to form the highest peaks and craggy ridges, while softer sedimentary layers are more easily eroded and form lowlands or valleys where glacial ice could deepen and widen pre-existing river valleys.

## Glacial processes: erosion, transport and deposition
Glacial landscapes were sculpted by three broad sets of processes: erosion, transport and deposition. Erosional processes include abrasion, where rock fragments frozen into the base and sides of a glacier grind over bedrock like sandpaper, and plucking, when meltwater penetrates joints, refreezes and pulls blocks of rock out as the ice moves. These actions deepen and steepen valleys, carve hollows and produce polished bedrock surfaces and striations that show the direction of former ice movement. Glaciers carry vast quantities of debris within, on top of, and beneath the ice; this sediment can be sorted and deposited as the glacier melts. Deposition produces a range of landforms from moraines — ridges of unsorted glacial till left at the glacier’s margins — to smoother, streamlined features such as drumlins where debris has been reshaped by flowing ice. Understanding how erosion and deposition combine helps explain why upland areas display a mosaic of corries and tarns, arêtes and U-shaped valleys alongside morainic hummocks and rock outcrops.

## Weathering, mass movement and post-glacial processes
After glaciers retreated, a suite of non-glacial processes continued to modify upland terrain. Freeze–thaw weathering is particularly effective in cold upland climates: water enters cracks, freezes, expands and progressively breaks rock apart. Mechanical weathering supplies material for mass movement: soil creep, rockfalls and slides move debris downslope, gradually filling valley bases and modifying glacially carved profiles. In many uplands periglacial processes — active in areas that were near the margins of ice sheets or experienced intense frost action — left patterned ground, solifluction lobes and other features. Rivers reoccupy glaciated valleys and build alluvial flats and levees. Vegetation recovery and soil development also change the appearance and functioning of these landscapes over time, influencing runoff, erosion rates and habitat diversity.

## Key glacial landforms and how they were created
Glaciated uplands show distinctive erosional landforms including corries (cirques), arêtes, pyramidal peaks, hanging valleys and glacial troughs. Corries form where snow accumulates and compresses into ice in hollowed bedrock, steepening the back wall by plucking and scouring and often leaving a small lake or tarn in the hollow after ice melts. Arêtes are narrow ridges between adjacent corries formed by headward erosion on both sides; where three or more corries meet, a pyramidal peak or horn can develop. Glacial troughs are deepened and widened river valleys with a characteristic U-shaped cross-section; their steep sides and flat floors contrast with the V-shaped valleys carved by rivers alone. Depositional landforms include ground moraines, terminal moraines, drumlins, eskers and roche moutonnées. Drumlins are elongate hills of compacted till that align with ice flow, while roche moutonnées are asymmetric bedrock knobs smoothed on the stoss side by abrasion and plucked on the lee side. Recognising these landforms on maps and in the field is essential: corries appear as armchair hollows with steep contours and often a small lake symbol; U-shaped valleys show wide spacing between contour lines on valley floors and steep sides.

## Human activity, impacts and management in glaciated uplands
Glaciated upland areas are multifunctional landscapes where agriculture, forestry, water supply, renewable energy, recreation and conservation coexist and often compete. Traditional sheep farming shapes vegetation patterns and can exacerbate soil erosion and limit tree regeneration. Forestry plantations, frequently established on gentler slopes or valley floors, change habitats and can alter drainage characteristics. Upland valleys are attractive sites for reservoirs and hydroelectric schemes because glacial troughs provide natural basins; while reservoirs secure water and generate renewable energy, they may flood habitats and alter sediment flows. Wind farms on ridges and moors provide low-carbon electricity but provoke debate over visual impact, effects on peat and local ecology. Tourism is a major economic driver: walkers, climbers and visitors bring income but also create erosion on footpaths, pressure on fragile soils and increased demand for housing and infrastructure. Management responses include National Park designation, path repair and erosion control, zoning of activities, visitor education, reforestation and peatland restoration. Evaluating alternatives requires weighing environmental protection against the livelihoods of local people and regional development goals.

## Case study: The Lake District as an example of a glaciated upland landscape
The Lake District is a useful UK case study because it combines dramatic glacial landforms with significant human use and strong conservation measures. The area’s highest peaks are underlain by ancient volcanic and metamorphic rocks that resisted erosion, giving high relief. During the last ice age, valley glaciers deepened and widened river valleys into classic U-shaped troughs, excavated corries such as Red Tarn beneath Helvellyn and deposited moraines that now dam lakes like Ullswater and Windermere. Human activity in the Lake District has long included sheep grazing, slate quarrying and tourism. In recent decades managers have sought to reduce path erosion through resurfacing, create viewer facilities to concentrate visitor impact, restore degraded peat to improve carbon storage and water quality, and balance farming subsidies with environmental outcomes. This case illustrates how geological inheritance, glacial processes and contemporary human choices interact to produce the landscape we see today and the kinds of management decisions that help sustain both natural heritage and local economies.

## Fieldwork and geographical skills linked to glaciated uplands
Studying glaciated upland landscapes offers rich opportunities to develop fieldwork and map skills. Fieldwork might involve mapping landforms at appropriate scales, sketching valley cross-sections, measuring and describing bank profiles, and recording bedrock type and structural features. On Ordnance Survey maps corrie backs correspond to tightly packed contours and tarns are small lake symbols, while drumlins and moraines can be inferred from hummocky or streamlined contour patterns. Using geological maps helps link landform distribution to rock type and structure, and climate and weather data can be used to explain ongoing erosion and vegetation patterns. Quantitative techniques such as measuring slope angles, sampling sediment size or calculating rates of footpath erosion complement qualitative observations like photographic records and visitor surveys. In exam contexts you may be required to interpret map evidence, use GIS screenshots, analyse field data and evaluate methods — so practice presenting data with clear, labelled sketches, annotated photographs and reasoned conclusions that refer back to your field evidence.

## Exam technique
To do well in questions on glaciated upland landscapes, combine precise geographical knowledge with clear application to named examples and careful use of evidence. When asked to describe, focus on the key physical features and use specialist terms such as corrie, arête, plucking and moraine; short descriptive sentences that give clear imagery are effective. For explain questions, structure each paragraph so it links a process to the resulting landform — for example, explain how plucking and abrasion produce a corrie, and show how its form leads to a tarn once ice retreats. In “assess” or “evaluate” questions consider a range of factors and reach a judgement: for instance, when assessing the benefits and drawbacks of building a reservoir in a glaciated valley, discuss water security and hydroelectric generation alongside habitat loss, sedimentation changes and impacts on local communities, concluding with which factor you judge most significant and why. Use PEEL (Point, Evidence, Explanation, Link) to structure extended answers, and always integrate a named UK example to gain marks for application and depth.

When using maps and photographs in responses, refer to contour patterns, slope steepness and visible depositional features; annotate sketches with arrows to show ice direction and label processes. For 8-mark and 12-mark answers, aim for two to three well-developed paragraphs that include specific detail, link to the case study, and end with a short evaluative judgement. Remember that up to four marks are available for spelling, punctuation, grammar and specialist terminology, so use technical words accurately and check your writing for clarity. Finally, practice planning answers under timed conditions, and learn to recognise command words so you respond with the appropriate depth: “describe” needs clear features, “explain” needs causes and processes, and “evaluate” requires weighing evidence and reaching a supported conclusion.
