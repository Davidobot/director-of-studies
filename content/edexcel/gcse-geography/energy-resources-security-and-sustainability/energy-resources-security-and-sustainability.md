# Energy resources, security and sustainability (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: why energy matters for people and the planet
Energy underpins modern life. It powers homes, hospitals and factories; it fuels transport and agriculture; it supports industry and communication. How and where energy is produced therefore shapes economic development, international relations and the condition of ecosystems. As the world’s population grows and more people move into higher-consumption lifestyles, demand for energy rises. At the same time most people and governments are increasingly concerned about the environmental effects of energy production and use, especially the role fossil fuels play in producing greenhouse gases and driving climate change. Studying energy resources, access and security helps you understand not only the physical distribution of resources but also the human decisions, trade-offs and technologies that determine who gets energy, at what price, and with what environmental cost.

## Classifying energy resources: non‑renewable, renewable and recyclable
Energy resources are commonly grouped by whether they are finite or naturally replenished. Non‑renewable resources, such as coal, oil and natural gas, formed over millions of years from buried organic matter and are available in finite stocks. Renewables are flows of energy that are naturally replenished on human timescales; examples include wind, solar, tidal and running water used in hydroelectric power. The specification also uses the term “recyclable” for some energy sources, applying it to systems like nuclear fuel cycles and biofuels where materials can be processed or reused in ways that extend their availability or reduce waste. Each classification has implications for sustainability, cost and geography. Non‑renewables tend to be concentrated in particular countries or regions, creating patterns of production and trade, whereas renewables are more widely available but variable in space and time; how these differences are managed is central to questions of energy security and sustainability.

## Environmental and social consequences of extraction and use
Extracting and using energy causes a range of environmental impacts. Mining and drilling can damage landscapes, destroy habitats and cause pollution. Oil spills from tankers or offshore platforms can devastate marine ecosystems and coastal communities. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants that affect air quality and contribute to global warming. Renewable technologies bring their own impacts: large hydroelectric dams can flood valleys and displace people, wind farms require land and may affect bird migration or local visual amenity, and solar farms compete for land use. Social consequences are equally important. Energy projects can create jobs and local development, but they can also cause conflict over land rights, lead to health problems from pollution, or concentrate wealth in the hands of a few companies. Sustainable energy planning requires balancing economic benefits with environmental protection and social justice, often through careful environmental impact assessments and community engagement.

## Energy access, consumption patterns and security
Access to energy varies widely around the world and within countries. Per capita energy consumption is typically highest in wealthy, industrialised countries because of high standards of living, energy‑intensive industries and transport systems. Low‑income countries may depend heavily on traditional biomass such as wood and dung, which has implications for health, gender roles and deforestation. Energy security means reliable and affordable access to energy supplies. It depends on the location of resources, the resilience of supply chains, storage capacity and the political relationships between producer and consumer countries. Disruptions caused by conflict, trade embargoes, market volatility or extreme weather can have immediate economic and humanitarian impacts. For this reason, many governments pursue energy diversification, strategic reserves, and infrastructure investments to reduce vulnerability to supply shocks. Understanding patterns of demand, imports and exports helps explain why some states prioritise self‑sufficiency while others depend on global markets.

## Fossil fuels, unconventional sources and the geopolitics of supply
Oil, coal and gas remain dominant in the global energy mix, but easy, conventional resources have become harder and more expensive to find. This has driven development of unconventional sources such as tar sands, deepwater oil, shale gas and coalbed methane. These resources expand supplies but usually at higher financial and environmental cost: tar sands extraction requires intensive energy and water use and produces large greenhouse gas emissions relative to conventional oil, while hydraulic fracturing for shale gas raises concerns about groundwater contamination and induced seismicity. The uneven geographic distribution of conventional reserves has long shaped geopolitics. Major producers can influence global prices and international relations. Price fluctuations and supply anxieties affect national economies and consumer prices, while competition for new supplies can create environmental strain in fragile ecosystems where producers seek access. When studying these topics, it is important to consider both economic drivers that make new sources attractive and the environmental trade‑offs they entail.

## Renewable energy, technological limits and opportunities
Renewable energy technologies are central to reducing carbon emissions and improving long‑term sustainability, but they have practical limitations and require complementary policy and infrastructure choices. Wind and solar are now cost‑competitive in many places and scale quickly, yet they are intermittent: the wind does not always blow and the sun does not always shine. This variability creates a need for energy storage solutions, grid upgrades and demand‑management strategies to ensure supply matches demand. Hydroelectricity provides reliable baseload in some regions but can cause large social and ecological impacts. Biofuels and biomass can substitute for fossil fuels in specific contexts but raise questions about land use and food security. Nuclear power offers high output with low direct carbon emissions, yet concerns about radioactive waste management, safety and high upfront costs remain politically contentious. Advances such as battery technology, smart grids and hydrogen offer ways to integrate renewables more effectively, but these technologies also require investment, regulation and time to scale.

## Managing the transition: policy choices, trade‑offs and local examples
Moving from a fossil‑fuel based system toward a lower‑carbon future involves economic, technical and ethical choices. Policies such as carbon pricing, subsidies for low‑carbon technologies, efficiency standards and investment in public transport can shift behaviour and markets. Some countries choose to prioritise rapid reduction in emissions and invest heavily in renewables and electrification; others focus on energy security through domestic extraction or nuclear power. Each pathway has winners and losers: workers in fossil fuel industries may lose jobs while new sectors expand, rural landscapes may host renewable infrastructure, and energy prices can rise or fall depending on subsidies and market design. Practical examples help illustrate these trade‑offs. A country with abundant wind can develop offshore wind farms and export electricity, while a nation with large oil reserves might prioritise petrochemical industries and use revenues for development. In fragile ecosystems, decisions to exploit resources often provoke debate about protecting biodiversity versus generating national income, so sustainable strategies commonly include protected areas, community benefits, and international agreements that balance local and global needs.

## Exam technique
When answering questions about energy resources, always link physical geography to human geography: explain how geology or climate creates resource opportunities and then discuss the social, economic and environmental consequences. For command words such as “describe” use clear, factual statements; for “explain” or “assess” make sure you give reasons and consequences, and where asked provide balanced evaluation. For extended questions, set out an argument with a clear introduction, developed paragraphs that use named examples and data where appropriate, and a reasoned conclusion. In decision‑making questions, consider at least two realistic options, evaluate their likely physical and human impacts, and justify your recommendation with evidence drawn from the resources and your wider knowledge. When using statistics, maps or graphs, describe what the data shows and use it to support your point. Remember that quality of written communication and specialist terminology are assessed, so use correct terms such as “intermittency”, “carbon footprint”, “hydraulic fracturing” or “energy mix” and check your spelling and grammar. Manage your time so that you allocate more time to higher‑mark questions, plan longer answers briefly before writing, and leave a couple of minutes to read through and correct key errors.
