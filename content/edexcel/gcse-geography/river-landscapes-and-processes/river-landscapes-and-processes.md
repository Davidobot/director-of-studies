# River landscapes and processes (GCSE Geography Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview of river systems and why they matter
Rivers are dynamic systems that shape landscapes, support ecosystems and provide water, food and transport for people. A river system includes the source where water first collects, the channel that carries the flow, the floodplain that stores water during high flows, and the mouth where the river meets the sea. Understanding rivers means looking at the processes of weathering, erosion, transport and deposition, and at how these processes vary from the steep, narrow upland headwaters to the wide, slow lower course. Rivers are also places where human activity has a direct impact: land use, urbanisation and engineering alter how water moves through a catchment and change flood risk, sediment supply and landscape character. At GCSE level you are expected to explain the physical processes, identify river landforms and evaluate human interventions, using both knowledge and practical skills such as reading maps, interpreting data and analysing fieldwork results.

## River processes: the work of water and gravity
River landscapes are created by a set of linked physical processes. Weathering breaks down rock at the surface through mechanical, chemical and biological actions. Mass movement such as slumping or landslides moves material downslope into channels. Within the channel, erosion happens by hydraulic action (the force of water), abrasion (rock fragments grinding the bed and banks), attrition (rock fragments colliding and becoming smaller) and solution (chemical dissolution). Once material is detached it is transported as bed load (traction and saltation), suspended load (fine particles carried within the flow) or dissolved load. Where the river’s energy falls, deposition occurs and sediment is dropped, building features such as point bars, levees and floodplains. The balance between these processes varies with discharge, velocity, gradient and sediment supply, which all change along the river’s long profile from source to mouth.

## How river characteristics change downstream
As you move from upper to middle to lower course, several measurable characteristics change in a consistent way. Channel width and depth generally increase downstream as tributaries add water, while the gradient (slope) tends to decrease. Discharge usually rises as more area contributes runoff, and average velocity often increases, though local conditions such as channel roughness can alter this. Sediment size typically becomes smaller and more rounded downstream because of attrition and selective deposition. These changes explain why the upper course is dominated by vertical erosion and features such as waterfalls and interlocking spurs, the middle course by lateral erosion and meanders, and the lower course by deposition and floodplain development.

## Distinctive river landforms and how they form
Rivers create a range of distinctive landforms through the interaction of erosion, transport and deposition together with underlying geology. In upland areas waterfalls form where a band of harder rock overlies softer rock; the softer rock erodes more quickly, creating a plunge pool and, over time, a retreating waterfall and a gorge. Interlocking spurs are produced where a young river winds around resistant hillsides. In the middle course, meanders develop because of helicoidal flow that erodes the outer bank and deposits on the inner bank, eventually forming oxbow lakes when a meander is cut off. Lower courses commonly have wide floodplains and natural levees created by successive overbank deposits. Which features form and how pronounced they are depends strongly on geology: resistant igneous or metamorphic rocks lead to steeper, more confined channels, while softer sedimentary rocks allow wider valleys and easier lateral erosion. When studying river landforms it is useful to link the pattern of landforms to geological maps and cross-sections to show the relationship between rock type and form.

## Flooding: causes, impacts and the role of human activity
Floods are among the most significant river hazards. They can arise from intense short-term rainfall, prolonged wet weather that saturates soils, rapid snowmelt, or tidal influences in lower reaches. Human factors make a real difference to flood response: urban surfaces reduce infiltration and increase rapid surface runoff, drainage and channelisation can speed water downstream, and deforestation reduces interception and increases peak flows. The impacts of flooding fall into social, economic and environmental categories: homes and businesses damaged, transport and services disrupted, and natural habitats altered. Understanding causes requires combining meteorological data (rainfall totals and antecedent conditions) with knowledge of vegetation, soil type and land use. A useful classroom skill is to draw and interpret storm hydrographs: the shape of the hydrograph (lag time, peak discharge, steepness of rising and falling limbs) tells you about the catchment response and how factors like urbanisation or steep slopes alter flood risk.

## Managing rivers: engineering and softer approaches
Managing rivers requires choices between hard engineering, soft engineering and non-structural approaches, each with trade-offs. Hard engineering includes dams and reservoirs that store water and reduce downstream peaks, channelisation that straightens and deepens channels to move water away quickly, and embankments or flood walls that protect buildings. These can be effective in the short term, but can be expensive, change natural flow regimes, reduce sediment transport and transfer problems downstream. Soft engineering and sustainable approaches work with natural processes: floodplain zoning prevents building in vulnerable areas, washlands allow controlled flooding to protect urban cores, river restoration reconnects rivers with their floodplains, and upstream afforestation reduces rapid runoff. An integrated approach, combining land-use planning, early warning systems and community preparedness, is increasingly favoured. When evaluating any management strategy, consider cost, environmental impact, social consequences (such as displacement), and long-term sustainability in the context of climate change, which is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events in many parts of the UK.

## Fieldwork and practical skills for river investigations
Fieldwork is central to understanding river processes and landscapes. In physical investigations you will be expected to collect quantitative data such as river discharge and sediment size, and qualitative data such as the presence and condition of landforms. Discharge is commonly measured by the velocity-area method: measure channel width and a number of depth readings across the cross-section, determine an average depth to calculate cross-sectional area, then measure flow velocity with a current meter or use a float method (corrected for surface velocity). Discharge is then calculated as Q = A × v, where Q is discharge, A is area and v is velocity. Sediment sampling techniques include pebble counts (e.g. the Wolman method) to produce grain-size distributions and assessments of roundness. Mapping and photographic records, annotated sketches and a transect across the channel and floodplain add qualitative depth. In addition, students should know how to use secondary sources: Environment Agency flood risk maps, BGS geological maps to link rock type to features, and weather or discharge datasets to construct storm hydrographs. Accurate recording, consideration of sampling reliability and clear presentation of results using graphs and annotated maps are essential skills that will be examined.

## Case study: a named UK river landscape — the River Tees
A named case study brings together physical processes, landforms and human interactions. The River Tees in north-east England provides a clear example of contrasts along a river. In its upper course the Tees flows over the Whin Sill, an igneous intrusion, which creates the spectacular waterfall at High Force; here the resistant rock forms a cap over softer layers and the process of differential erosion has produced a plunge pool and a retreating waterfall with a gorge. Moving downstream into the middle course the channel becomes wider and meanders develop where lateral erosion dominates; you can find oxbow lakes and point bars where deposition has been active. In the lower Tees, near Middlesbrough and Teesside, human activity has profoundly altered the river through the construction of the Tees Barrage, docks and industrial channels, and extensive flood defences. These interventions aid navigation, reduce tidal intrusion and control water levels, but they also change sediment dynamics and can affect habitats. Flood risk in towns along the Tees has been managed through a combination of engineered defences and planning measures, illustrating the trade-offs between protecting people and maintaining natural river function. When you use a named river in exams, include specific features, the role of geology and explicit examples of human management to support your explanations and judgments.

## Exam technique
Answering river questions well requires clear use of geographic terminology, precise links between processes and landforms, and the use of evidence including named examples or fieldwork data. When a question asks you to "describe" or "identify," focus on clear factual statements about features or processes. For "explain" and "assess" questions always link cause and effect: for example, describe how urban surfaces reduce lag time and then explain how that increases peak discharge and flood risk. For extended writing, structure your response with an opening that addresses the question directly, a middle that develops two or three well-evidenced points (each explaining causes, effects and examples), and a conclusion that evaluates or judges the overall issue. Include relevant measurements and calculations where required: for discharge problems show your working Q = A × v, and when interpreting hydrographs refer to lag time, rising limb and peak discharge and explain how catchment characteristics produce the observed shape. Use your case study details—naming rivers, landforms and specific human interventions—to add credibility and to gain AO1 and AO3 marks. In fieldwork questions, state the methods used, justify your sampling strategy, comment on reliability and error, present clear graphs or annotated sketches, draw evidenced conclusions and reflect critically on limitations and possible improvements. Finally, remember that up to four marks are awarded for spelling, punctuation, grammar and the use of specialist terms, so write clearly and use key vocabulary (for example: hydraulic action, abrasion, traction, floodplain, levee, discharge, storm hydrograph) accurately. Practice past-style questions, link processes to places, and use your fieldwork experiences to back up explanations and judgements.
