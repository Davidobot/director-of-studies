# Islam: Muhammad, Five Pillars and Six Beliefs (A-level Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview and significance
Understanding Islam for A-level Religious Studies means grasping how doctrine, practice and the life of the Prophet Muhammad fit together to shape Muslim identity, ethics and communal life. Islam is not only a set of doctrines but a comprehensive way of life expressed through creeds and ritual obligations. For many Muslims the core of belief is summed up in the six articles of faith (commonly taught in Sunni contexts) and the five pillars provide the primary framework for practice. Both sets — beliefs and practices — are rooted in the Qur’an and the Prophet’s example (the Sunnah) as recorded in the hadith literature. Exam answers should therefore make clear connections between theological ideas, scriptural sources and lived practice.

## The life and historical context of Muhammad
Muhammad ibn Abd Allah was born in Mecca around 570 CE into the Quraysh tribe. Orphaned early, he worked as a merchant and gained a reputation for honesty. At about the age of forty he received the first revelations from God through the angel Gabriel, a process that continued for some twenty‑three years and produced the Qur’an. Muhammad’s early message called for tawhid (the worship of one God), social justice, care for the poor, and a rejection of Meccan polytheism. Opposition from Meccan elites led to increasing tension and ultimately to the hijra, the migration to Yathrib (later called Medina) in 622 CE, an event that marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina Muhammad became both a spiritual leader and a statesman, building the first cohesive Muslim community (umma), establishing communal laws and mediating tribal disputes. Over the next decade conflicts and treaties with Meccan authorities culminated in the Prophet’s return to Mecca in a largely peaceful conquest. Muhammad delivered the Farewell Sermon in 632 CE and died later that year. His life is studied not as mythic legend but as a historically situated example whose teachings and actions are normative for many Muslims.

## Muhammad’s role and how Muslims view him
Muhammad is regarded by Muslims primarily as the final prophet, the Seal of the Prophets, who received and transmitted God’s last revealed scripture, the Qur’an. He is honoured as the exemplar of ideal human conduct (uswa hasana) whose words and actions, preserved in the hadith, inform theology, law and daily life. It is important to stress that Islamic doctrine is emphatic that Muhammad is not divine and must not be worshipped; worship is reserved for Allah alone. Nevertheless his authority is profound because of his role in receiving revelation and because he is seen as the best interpreter and implementer of God’s will. In exam answers, differentiate carefully between the Qur’an as the primary source of revelation and the hadith/sunnah as interpretative practice and guidance.

## The Six Beliefs (Sunni formulation) and their implications
The six articles of faith commonly taught in Sunni contexts are tawhid (the oneness of God), belief in the angels, belief in the holy books, belief in the prophets (risalah) with Muhammad as final prophet, belief in the Day of Judgment (akhirah), and belief in predestination (qadr). Tawhid underpins everything: it affirms monotheism not only as belief in one God but as a shaping principle for ethics and law, rejecting any division of divine authority. Belief in angels recognises a created order of spiritual beings, exemplified by Gabriel’s role as revealer; angels are agents of God’s will and their existence reinforces a theology of communication between God and creation. The status of the holy books culminates in the Qur’an as the final and uncorrupted revelation; other scriptures are respected in Islamic teaching but the Qur’an has unique authority for doctrine and law. Acceptance of prophethood situates Muhammad within a line of messengers who convey God’s guidance; this validates the authority of his teachings and the community’s reliance on hadith as explanation. Belief in resurrection and the Day of Judgment gives moral urgency to conduct in this life because actions are accountable in the hereafter; this has particular relevance to social justice, charity and legal norms. Predestination, understood in various ways across Muslim thought, raises difficult questions about free will and responsibility; students should show awareness of different theological responses, for example the contrast between deterministic readings and more nuanced positions that preserve moral agency.

When answering questions on the six beliefs, illustrate how each belief translates into practical consequences: tawhid motivates strict monotheistic worship and influences theology; belief in scripture shapes legal and moral reasoning; belief in the afterlife motivates ethical conduct. A-level answers benefit from acknowledging diversity of interpretation within Islam, including how some Shia formulations differ by emphasising doctrines such as the Imamate.

## The Five Pillars: practice, meaning and variations
The five pillars — shahada (declaration of faith), salah (prayer), zakah (almsgiving), sawm (fasting in Ramadan) and hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) — are the principal acts by which Muslim belief is enacted communally and individually. The shahada, the testimony that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger, is both the entry statement into Islam and an ongoing confession that shapes identity. Salah, performed five times daily by most Sunnis at prescribed times facing Mecca, structures the day and provides regular ritual submission, combining Qur’anic recitation, physical prostration and communal expression where possible. Zakah is an obligatory form of wealth redistribution intended to purify assets and to support the vulnerable; while the canonical rate often cited is 2.5% of certain forms of wealth, scholarly and practical variation exists, and zakah functions alongside voluntary sadaqah. Sawm in the month of Ramadan involves refraining from food, drink and sexual relations from dawn to sunset; beyond physical self‑discipline it cultivates empathy with the poor and spiritual reflection. Hajj, required once in a lifetime if a Muslim is able, reenacts episodes from Abrahamic tradition and the life of the Prophet through rituals such as tawaf (circumambulation of the Kaʿba), standing on Arafat and symbolic acts of sacrifice; Hajj has strong unifying and egalitarian symbolism, as pilgrims wear simple garments that minimize social distinctions.

Exam responses should explain not only the external ritual but also the inner aims: prayer as remembrance and submission, fasting as moral and spiritual training, zakah as social justice, pilgrimage as collective renewal. It is also useful to note variations in practice: Shia Muslims may combine certain prayer times, and legal schools differ on zakah calculations, permissible exemptions and the exact performance of rituals. Contemporary contexts such as urban Muslim minorities, secular states, and globalized pilgrimage logistics also shape how the pillars are lived.

## Sources, law and diversity: Qur’an, Hadith, Sunnah, schools
The Qur’an is the primary textual authority for both belief and practice, believed by Muslims to be the literal Word of God revealed to Muhammad. The hadith corpus — reports of the Prophet’s words and deeds — supplies the Sunnah, the practical example that helps interpret Qur’anic injunctions and fills in ritual details. Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) developed through interpretative methods using the Qur’an, authenticated hadith, consensus (ijmaʿ) and analogical reasoning (qiyas) with later juridical elaboration by various schools (madhahib). For A-level study it is important to distinguish between normative claims about revelation and the historical development of legal and interpretative traditions. Diversity within Islam — whether Sunni, Shia, or Sufi — affects emphases and theological formulations. For instance, Twelver Shia Islam articulates five roots of religion (Usul ad-Din) that differ from Sunni lists, placing special theological weight on the Imamate. Sufi traditions emphasize inner dimensions of the pillars, understanding prayer and fasting as means to mystical union and purification. Demonstrating awareness of this pluralism strengthens essay answers.

## Moral and social implications
The interlocking system of belief and practice in Islam produces distinctive moral priorities. Tawhid promotes ethical monotheism, implicating all aspects of life in an orientation toward God. The Five Pillars foster communal cohesion, social welfare and constant moral reminders; zakah institutionalizes responsibility to the poor while the fast cultivates solidarity. Belief in divine judgment motivates accountability beyond human courts. At the same time, internal debates about predestination, the scope of religious law, gender roles and modernity show that Islamic principles are applied differently in varied cultural and political contexts. A good A-level answer will illustrate how doctrinal principles influence concrete ethical positions and will critically engage with tensions, for example between traditional legal norms and contemporary human rights debates.

## Teaching tips and useful examples
When teaching these topics, use primary texts selectively to show how Qur’anic verses and hadith underpin beliefs and practices, for example references to the five daily prayers or the obligation of zakah. Employ case studies such as how a Muslim community organises Ramadan activities in a non‑Muslim country, or how hajj logistics reflect questions of equality and global inequality. Encourage students to compare Sunni and Shia perspectives where relevant, particularly on succession (which affects the role of leadership) and on theological emphases. Stress technical vocabulary — tawhid, risalah, akhira, qadr, shahada, zakah, sawm, hajj — and ask students to define and then explain the practical significance of each term.

## Exam technique
Answering Edexcel A-level questions successfully on this topic requires clear demonstration of both AO1 (knowledge and understanding) and AO2 (analysis and evaluation). Begin essays by defining key terms precisely and setting out a clear line of argument. Use the Qur’an and hadith to support AO1 claims, but avoid overreliance on quotation without explanation. Link beliefs to practices: for instance, show how tawhid underpins ritual prayer or how belief in the Day of Judgment informs ethical conduct. For AO2, balance description with critical engagement: present alternative interpretations, such as differing views on predestination or the variation between Sunni and Shia formulations, and weigh strengths and weaknesses. When asked to “to what extent” or “how far,” allocate time to develop a sustained argument that considers opposing views and reaches a substantiated conclusion. Structure responses so that paragraphs develop a single idea, supported by evidence and analysis, and conclude by summarising implications. Time management is crucial: for a 30‑mark question plan about 5–8 minutes, write for around 40–45 minutes where allowed, reserving time to proofread. Finally, aim to use specialist vocabulary accurately and to demonstrate the ability to connect doctrinal content to human experience and contemporary issues; such synoptic links are rewarded by the A-level assessment criteria.
