# Problems of evil and theodicies (A-level Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction
The problem of evil asks a basic but powerful question: how can an all-powerful, all-knowing and all-loving God coexist with the suffering and cruelty we see in the world? This question is central to the philosophy of religion and appears in many parts of the Pearson Edexcel specification: as a core philosophical problem, as a topic in the study of the Old Testament (for example, the Book of Job), and as an issue that religions and ethicists must address. For revision it helps to keep in mind two related tasks: first, to explain precisely what is meant by different kinds of evil and the forms of the problem; second, to summarise and evaluate the main responses—both philosophical and religious—that attempt to reconcile God and suffering.

## Types of evil and suffering
Clarity about vocabulary matters. Philosophers distinguish moral evil from natural evil. Moral evil refers to harm caused by free agents—for example murder, torture or systemic injustice—where human choices are central. Natural evil refers to suffering that seems to arise independently of human agency, such as earthquakes, floods or disease. A second useful distinction is between gratuitous or apparently pointless suffering and suffering that appears to have an intelligible purpose. Examples such as the Holocaust or the suffering of innocent children are often cited as especially challenging cases because they look gratuitous and call into question claims about divine goodness or purpose. When answering exam questions, show that you can apply these distinctions to concrete examples and explain why they matter for evaluating theodicies.

## Formulations of the problem: logical and evidential
Two standard ways of framing the problem of evil are the logical and the evidential. The logical problem argues that the traditional divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence) are logically incompatible with the existence of any evil at all. This is often expressed as an inconsistent triad: if God is willing to prevent evil but not able, then God is not omnipotent; if able but not willing, then God is not wholly good; if both able and willing, why does evil exist? The evidential problem is weaker but more influential in practice: it claims that the sheer amount and kinds of suffering make it unlikely that an all-good, all-powerful God exists. This argument does not claim logical impossibility but appeals to probability, pointing to apparently gratuitous evils as strong evidence against the classical idea of God. Being able to explain and distinguish these formulations, and to give philosophers’ examples (such as the “burning fawn” or real-world examples like famines and genocides), is essential in exams.

## Defence versus theodicy: what counts as a satisfactory response?
It helps to separate two kinds of replies. A defence tries to show that the problem of evil is not logically decisive against God; it aims to demonstrate that the presence of evil is logically compatible with divine attributes, even without explaining all suffering. A theodicy goes further: it offers a positive account as to why God allows evil and suffering, attempting to justify God’s actions or purposes. Students should show they understand this difference, because it affects evaluation. Defences aim to block the logical argument; theodicies seek to provide reasons that make suffering intelligible or morally acceptable within a theistic framework.

## Major theodicies and defences
A number of classic theodicies recur in the specification and in examination questions. Augustine’s theodicy treats evil as privation: God created the world good, but evil is not a created substance; it is a lack of the good that should be present. Augustine connects moral evil to misused free will, so God remains all-powerful and good while humans bear responsibility for evil. Irenaeus offers a different route: the world is a “vale of soul-making.” For Irenaeus (and in modern form, John Hick), suffering and moral challenge are necessary for moral and spiritual development; virtues such as compassion and courage can only emerge in a world in which hardship is possible. Hick adds a universalist element, arguing that God’s ultimate purpose is to bring all souls to maturity and eventual union with God, which can justify temporary suffering.

Plantinga’s free will defence, influential in analytic philosophy, insists that a world containing morally significant free creatures is of greater value than a world of automata. Plantinga argues that an omnipotent God could not create free beings who always choose the good, because freedom includes the genuine possibility of moral failure. Thus the existence of moral evil is consistent with God’s omnipotence and goodness; the defence does not explain natural evil directly, but some versions extend the account by tying natural evils to the consequences of human freedom or to a fallen order.

Process theodicy takes a different tack by modifying attributes of God. Influenced by process philosophy, it portrays God as not omnipotent in the classical sense: God cannot unilaterally determine every event but works persuasively within the world to bring about good. In this view, suffering results from the independent processes of a dynamic universe. The advantage is that it preserves God’s moral character and explains why God cannot simply stop every instance of suffering, but critics say it weakens traditional theism and changes the nature of divine worship.

Other responses include skeptical theism, which declines to posit reasons humans can grasp for God allowing certain evils. Skeptical theists argue that human epistemic limitations mean we should not expect to see God’s reasons, and so apparent gratuitous evils do not count strongly against God. Critics reply that skeptical theism can undermine moral reasoning and looks like an appeal to ignorance.

## Religious and scriptural responses
Religious traditions answer the problem of evil in different ways, often drawing on scripture, doctrine, and lived practice. The Book of Job provides a classic biblical exploration: Job’s suffering is not explained by a simple formula but leads to questions about divine justice, human limitation, and the appropriate human response—faith, complaint, or protest. In Jewish and Christian traditions, responses range from Augustine’s emphases on sin and fall, to pastoral emphases on redemptive suffering, to liberation theology’s focus on structural injustice and God’s preferential option for the oppressed. Islam commonly frames suffering as a test or trial from God and stresses submission to divine wisdom while also offering consolation in the promise of justice in the afterlife. Hindu and Buddhist approaches often invoke karma and rebirth: suffering can be explained as the result of earlier actions and as part of cycles that can be overcome by spiritual practice. When answering exam questions, show awareness of these religious angles and use textual or doctrinal examples (Job’s dialogues, Islamic teachings on trial, Hindu ideas of karma) to illustrate how different faiths make sense of suffering.

## Criticisms and evaluation
No theodicy is without difficulty, and strong exam answers will weigh strengths and weaknesses carefully. Augustine’s privation account makes sense of moral evil but struggles with natural evil and with why an omnipotent God would create beings capable of evil. The free will defence is persuasive against a strict logical argument, yet it struggles with natural disasters and with events affecting animals or children who cannot freely choose. Hick’s soul-making gives purpose to suffering but is accused of trivialising intense or apparently pointless evils, and its universalist conclusion is contested. Process theodicy solves the problem of divine impotence in the face of suffering but at the cost of traditional omnipotence and omniscience. Skeptical theism preserves divine mystery but risks moral paralysis because it can block legitimate moral inference. Students should show they can move beyond description to evaluation: highlight which problems remain, compare approaches, and consider whether a combination of responses (for example, free will defence plus an appeal to soul-making or eschatological justice) gives a more plausible framework. Use real-world examples to test the strengths of a theodicy and remember to treat the problem both philosophically and theologically.

## Exam technique
Start your answer by defining key terms: distinguish moral and natural evil, and explain whether the question asks for a logical or evidential problem or for an assessment of specific theodicies. Organise your essay into clear sections (definition, explanation of the problem, presentation of responses, evaluation) and signpost your argument so the examiner can follow your reasoning. When discussing theodicies, explain each view in sufficient detail, use examples (e.g. Job, natural disasters, the Holocaust) to test them, and be explicit about strengths and weaknesses. Avoid merely listing arguments; instead connect evaluation back to the central question. Use relevant philosophers and religious perspectives by name where appropriate, but focus on clarity rather than crowded detail. Conclude by weighing the competing responses and stating a reasoned judgement that reflects the evidence you have discussed. Finally, ensure quality of written communication: write legibly, use correct terminology, and check grammar and spelling—precise expression helps gain the higher AO1 and AO2 marks.
