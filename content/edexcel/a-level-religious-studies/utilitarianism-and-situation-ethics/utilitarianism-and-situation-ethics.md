# Utilitarianism and situation ethics (A-level Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview
Utilitarianism and situation ethics are two influential ethical approaches frequently examined on the Pearson Edexcel Religious Studies specification. Both emerged as responses to the desire for practical moral decision-making in a changing modern world, yet they differ in source, emphasis and method. Utilitarianism is a secular, broadly consequentialist theory that assesses right and wrong by reference to outcomes—typically the amount of pleasure or welfare produced. Situation ethics, developed in the mid‑20th century within a Christian context, refuses fixed legalistic rules in favour of making decisions case by case according to agape, the self-giving love that seeks the neighbour’s good. For A-level purposes it is important to be able to explain each theory clearly, outline key thinkers and variants, apply them to moral dilemmas, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.

## Utilitarianism: origins and core ideas
Utilitarianism began as a distinct ethical theory in the work of Jeremy Bentham in the late eighteenth century. Bentham argued that the moral worth of an action lies solely in its consequences and that our aim should be to maximise pleasure and minimise pain. He proposed a practical method for ethical calculation, the Hedonic Calculus, which invited decision-makers to assess pleasures and pains by criteria such as intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity and extent. John Stuart Mill refined Bentham’s account in the nineteenth century by defending qualitative distinctions between pleasures. Mill argued that intellectual and moral pleasures are of higher quality than mere bodily pleasures, encapsulated in his claim that "it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied." The classical utilitarian position is impartial: every person’s happiness counts equally, and the right action is the one that produces the greatest net good for the greatest number.

## Variants and later developments in utilitarian thought
Since Bentham and Mill, utilitarianism has diversified. Act utilitarianism, the view closer to Bentham, judges each individual action by its expected consequences. Rule utilitarianism, sometimes attributed to Mill and developed by later writers, holds that we should adopt those rules which, if generally followed, would maximise utility. Preference utilitarianism, advocated by contemporary figures such as Peter Singer, shifts the measure from pleasure to the satisfaction of preferences or interests: an action is right if it fulfils the preferences of those affected, insofar as those preferences are informed and comparable. Negative utilitarianism places primary importance on reducing suffering rather than maximising happiness. Each variant aims to preserve the core insight that consequences matter while responding to perceived problems in earlier formulations, for example by addressing rights, justice, or the measurement of welfare.

## Strengths of utilitarianism and common criticisms
Utilitarianism’s chief strengths are its clarity, simplicity and appeal to impartiality. It provides a transparent decision procedure and has a democratic feel: no one’s welfare is privileged by birth or status. It is flexible and practical, enabling moral reasoning about public policy, economics and issues in medical ethics where consequences are central. However, utilitarianism faces major philosophical and practical objections. Measuring and comparing pleasures or preferences is notoriously difficult; the Hedonic Calculus can seem artificial when applied to real cases. Utilitarianism can yield counter‑intuitive results that appear to violate justice or rights, such as endorsing the sacrifice of an innocent minority if it increases overall welfare. Critics also argue the theory is too demanding—expecting continuous impartial altruism—and neglects moral motives and integrity. Philosophers drawing on deontological or virtue ethical frameworks point out that some actions ought to be prohibited irrespective of consequences, and that aggregate welfare can be a poor guide in situations where rights or human dignity are at stake.

## Situation ethics: context and key principles
Situation ethics emerged in the 1950s and 1960s in the work of J. A. T. Robinson and, most fully, Joseph Fletcher. It grew in part as a theological response to the moral complexities of the modern age—changes in social attitudes after the Second World War, and a perceived need to make Christian morality relevant to personal decision-making. Situation ethics rejects an absolute legalism that applies rules rigidly in every circumstance, arguing instead that moral decision-making must be governed by agapeic love. Fletcher set out his theory in terms of six propositions and four working principles. The six propositions summarise the theory—most famously that only one thing is intrinsically good (love), that love is the ruling norm, and that decisions must be made situationally rather than by fixed rules. The four working principles—pragmatism, relativism, positivism and personalism—require that moral action be practical, relative to situation, grounded in a freely chosen commitment to love, and centred on people rather than laws. Situation ethics is explicitly Christian in its vocabulary but intended to be applicable to concrete ethical dilemmas.

## Strengths of situation ethics and criticisms
Situation ethics’ major strength lies in its sensitivity to human circumstances and its prioritising of compassion. It can handle moral complexity in a humane way and discourages legalistic or pietistic rule-following that ignores suffering. It also emphasises personal responsibility and mature moral reasoning. Critics, however, raise significant objections. The theory’s relativism troubles many: if love alone is the guiding norm, how can conflicts of love be resolved reliably? The absence of fixed rules makes moral guidance less predictable and opens the door to justification of harmful acts in the name of “love.” The theological grounding—agape as the ultimate norm—will be unpersuasive to non‑Christian critics, and some Christian ethicists argue that Fletcher’s account reduces Christian ethics to a sentimental subjectivism. Other critics, such as William Barclay, argued that situation ethics is dangerously permissive and insufficiently attentive to moral boundaries that protect individuals and communities.

## Comparing and applying the theories to moral problems
Both utilitarianism and situation ethics are consequentialist in practice: they focus on outcomes rather than rigid observance of rules. Yet they differ in the standard used to judge outcomes. Utilitarianism appeals to aggregate happiness or preference satisfaction and aims for impartial maximisation, whereas situation ethics evaluates actions by the quality of agapeic love shown in each concrete context, prioritising personal relationships and the immediate good of one’s neighbour. In application to medical ethics, such as euthanasia, utilitarianism would weigh the suffering and welfare of patient, family and society and may permit voluntary euthanasia where it reduces net suffering. Situation ethics would ask what loving action in this situation most benefits the patient as a person, and might reach the same practical verdict while motivated by agape rather than a calculus. On sexual ethics, utilitarianism assesses practices by their consequences for wellbeing; situation ethics evaluates each relationship by whether it embodies self-giving love and respects persons. In matters of war and peace, utilitarian considerations about casualty figures and long-term welfare compete with situation ethics’ emphasis on personal love: both can, in principle, justify or condemn war depending on how consequences or love are judged. The contrasting procedures and starting points of the two approaches make them useful comparative tools for examining controversial moral issues in essays and exams.

## Exam technique
When answering questions on utilitarianism and situation ethics for Pearson Edexcel, begin by defining the theory succinctly and naming its key proponents—Bentham and Mill for utilitarianism; Fletcher (and Robinson’s influence) for situation ethics. Demonstrate AO1 by carefully explaining central concepts such as the Hedonic Calculus, higher and lower pleasures, act versus rule utilitarianism, agape, Fletcher’s propositions and working principles. Use well‑chosen examples to show how the theory would be applied; concrete cases from sexual ethics, medical ethics or hypothetical dilemmas make your knowledge more persuasive. For AO2, assess strengths and weaknesses: balance praise (clarity, flexibility, impartiality, compassion) with critical problems (measurement, justice, relativism, permissiveness). Compare and contrast the theories where appropriate: show, for instance, how both are teleological in practice but differ in normative standard and decision procedure. Always engage with scholars and critics—citing Mill’s quality distinction, Singer’s preference utilitarianism, or Barclay’s critique of situation ethics strengthens evaluation. Structure answers so that each paragraph develops a clear point, and conclude with a reasoned judgement that reflects the evidence you have discussed rather than an unsupported assertion. Time management is essential: for a 30‑mark question allocate time to plan, to develop balanced AO1 and AO2 coverage, and to reach a concise conclusion. Finally, attend to clarity of expression and use technical terms accurately: quality of written communication is part of the assessment, and precise language often distinguishes a good answer from an excellent one.
