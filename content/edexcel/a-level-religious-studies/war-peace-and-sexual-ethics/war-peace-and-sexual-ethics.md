# War, peace and sexual ethics (A-level Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: why these topics matter
War, peace and sexual ethics are central areas in religious and ethical study because they bring together principles, lived practice and deep human experience. Questions about when violence can be justified, how societies should respond to aggression, and whether pacifism is realistic prompt careful moral reasoning and draw on scripture, tradition and modern philosophy. Sexual ethics raises equally testing issues about personal relationships, gender, identity, consent and the role of religious teachings in public life. For A‑level Religious Studies you will be expected to show clear knowledge (AO1) of key concepts and religious positions, and well‑reasoned evaluation (AO2) that compares views, applies ethical theories and reaches justified conclusions. Throughout, use real examples and make links between theory and practice.

## Ethical theories and key concepts to use
Before tackling specific issues, it helps to be secure with ethical language and theory. Natural moral law (associated with Aquinas) sees moral rules as rooted in human nature and reason, so actions are right if they fulfil human goods. Deontological ethics (Kantian) emphasizes duty and principles regardless of consequences. Utilitarianism judges actions by their outcomes and aims to maximise overall happiness. Situation ethics and modern consequentialist or virtue approaches offer alternatives that stress context, love or character. Other important concepts are conscience, absolute versus relative moral rules, objectivity versus relativism, rights, justice, and the distinction between jus ad bellum (justice of going to war) and jus in bello (justice in conduct during war). When you use these theories in answers, define terms briefly, apply them to concrete examples and weigh strengths and weaknesses.

## War and peace: Just War theory and its criteria
Just War theory is a long‑standing Christian tradition, later restated by philosophers and ethicists, that attempts to set limits on when and how war may be morally justified. Key criteria commonly used to judge the justice of going to war include just cause (for example self‑defence or protection of innocents), legitimate authority (a proper decision‑maker), right intention (aiming at a just peace, not revenge), last resort (all peaceful options exhausted), reasonable chance of success (futility is not permitted), proportionality (the good achieved must outweigh the harm), and discrimination (combatants and non‑combatants must be distinguished). In practice these criteria are tools for analysis rather than a simple checklist; students should be prepared to apply them to case studies such as interventions to halt genocide, or debates about pre‑emptive strikes. Strengths of Just War theory include its attempt to moralise state behaviour and to protect civilians; critiques point to ambiguity in applying criteria, the problem of subjective interpretation (what counts as legitimate authority or just cause), and the risk that justifications are used to rationalise aggression.

## Pacifism, non‑violence and modern responses
Pacifism asserts that violence is always wrong. Religious pacifism can be absolute, as in some interpretations of Jesus’ teaching about turning the other cheek and in Quaker tradition, or conditional, as in those who reject most war but accept self‑defence in extreme cases. Non‑violent resistance, exemplified by Gandhi’s satyagraha, offers a different model: active opposition to injustice without physical violence. Contemporary debates extend to conscientious objection, the morality of humanitarian interventions, the ethics of nuclear deterrence and the impact of technological warfare (drones, cyber‑warfare) on the ability to apply traditional moral criteria. When evaluating pacifism, consider powerful moral arguments in its favour—the sanctity of life, the corrosive effects of killing on agents and societies—and practical criticisms about whether pacifism can protect innocent victims in the face of aggression. A balanced answer will show awareness of how different religious traditions justify or reject violence, and how modern political realities complicate simple prescriptions.

## Sexual ethics: religious teachings and diversity of views
Sexual ethics covers sexual behaviour, marriage, family life and related matters such as contraception, divorce, same‑sex relationships and sexual identity. Religious traditions approach these issues with different emphases. Classical Christian teaching, particularly in Catholic thought, traditionally links sex to procreation and the unity of marriage, and has historically opposed artificial contraception and extra‑marital sex; Protestant and Anglican responses vary widely, from conservative to liberal. Islam emphasises sexual relations within marriage, sanctions contraception in many contexts, and generally disapproves of same‑sex acts, though there is diversity in interpretation. Judaism offers a range from Orthodox strictures to Reform and Liberal openness; traditional Jewish law focuses on marital duties and prohibitions found in scripture. Hindu and Buddhist perspectives are diverse: many strands stress duty, caste and family roles or the avoidance of sexual misconduct rather than a single sexual ethic, while Buddhism’s precept against sexual misconduct is interpreted in different ways according to context. Sikh teaching upholds marriage and faithful conduct and stresses equality. In answers you should show these differences and avoid overgeneralising; where possible refer to specific teachings, concepts (for example sexual misconduct, agape, dharma, mitzvot) and the implications for believers.

## Applying ethical theories to sexual ethics: issues and case studies
Theoretical approaches illuminate sexual ethics in distinct ways. A natural law account tends to argue that sexual acts have intrinsic purposes and must conform to natural ends, so contraception and non‑procreative sex can be problematic. Utilitarian analysis assesses consequences: contraception may be permitted if it increases well‑being and reduces suffering. Situation ethics would prioritise love (agape) and may support decisions that best express love in particular circumstances, for example when contraception preserves the health of a mother. Virtue ethics asks what a flourishing person would do, focusing on character and relationships rather than individual acts. Use these frameworks to analyse practical problems: should a religious hospital provide IVF or contraception? How should religious communities respond to same‑sex marriage in a plural society? When discussing contentious topics always present both strengths and weaknesses of each approach, consider lived consequences for real people, and show awareness of changing social contexts and internal diversity within religious traditions.

## Contemporary challenges and classroom examples
Modernity brings legal, social and technological changes that test traditional teachings. The decriminalisation and legal recognition of same‑sex partnerships, widespread availability of contraception and fertility technologies, and changing gender roles have all prompted theological reflection and differing institutional responses. In the area of war, the development of international humanitarian law, the UN system for collective security, and debates over humanitarian intervention and responsibility to protect (R2P) are relevant contexts for evaluating religious teachings. Classroom examples that work well include examining a historical case (for instance responses to conscription and conscientious objection in the world wars), analysing a modern intervention through Just War criteria, or taking a moral dilemma such as a religious hospital’s policy on contraception and asking students to apply a variety of ethical theories to reach reasoned conclusions. Use source material—scriptural passages, statements by religious authorities, and influential philosophers—and train to distinguish descriptive statements (what a tradition teaches) from evaluative ones (whether that teaching is justified).

## Exam technique
Answering exam questions successfully depends on clear structure and the balance of AO1 and AO2. Begin by defining key terms and briefly outlining relevant theories or religious positions to secure AO1 marks. Use paragraphing to separate description from evaluation: one paragraph can summarise a belief or the criteria of a theory; the next can apply it to an example; follow with an evaluative paragraph weighing strengths and weaknesses. Always include specific religious or philosophical examples to show detailed knowledge—this demonstrates precise AO1 content—and then move to critical assessment to demonstrate AO2. Avoid long narrative descriptions that do not address the question. Use comparative language when required, showing contrasts between traditions or between theories. Where the question asks “To what extent…?” or “Assess…”, aim for a balanced conclusion that recognises the force of different views and defends a reasoned position supported by evidence. Time management is vital: allocate time according to marks available, plan answers with a brief outline before you write, and read the question carefully for command words (explain, discuss, evaluate). Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions and seek feedback to improve clarity, accuracy of terminology and the quality of evaluation.
