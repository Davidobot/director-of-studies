# Deontology, natural law and virtue ethics (A-level Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: what these ethical theories are and why they matter
Deontology, natural law and virtue ethics are three major approaches in moral philosophy that offer different ways of answering the central question: how should I decide what to do? Deontology focuses on duty and principle, natural law grounds morality in a rational order woven into human nature and the world, and virtue ethics concentrates on the character and flourishing of the moral agent. Together they provide contrasting resources for analysing contemporary ethical dilemmas, from medical ethics to sexual ethics and issues of justice. For A-level Religious Studies you will be asked to explain the key concepts of each approach, show how each aims to guide moral action, and evaluate strengths and weaknesses using reasoned argument and examples. Knowing the historical roots and representative thinkers—Kant and Ross for deontology, Aquinas and contemporary natural law theorists for natural law, and Aristotle and modern revivalists such as Anscombe and MacIntyre for virtue ethics—helps you to anchor explanations and to deploy scholarly viewpoints in evaluation.

## Deontology: duty, rules and the categorical imperative
Deontology is an ethics of duty. The most famous deontological account is Immanuel Kant’s. Kant argued that moral worth lies not in the consequences of an action but in acting from duty in accordance with universal moral law discovered by reason. His central test is the categorical imperative. One formulation asks whether the maxim of an action could be willed as a universal law: if I lie to get what I want, could I will that everyone in that situation lie? If universalised the practice would undermine the very purpose of the act, so it is impermissible. Another formulation instructs us to treat people always as ends in themselves and never merely as means; that is, persons have intrinsic dignity and must not be exploited for another’s purposes. Deontological ethics thus yields clear rules and absolute prohibitions in many cases: lying, murder or treating humans as mere tools would typically be ruled out regardless of beneficial consequences.

Deontology also includes pluralist versions such as W. D. Ross’s intuitionist deontology. Ross argued that moral life is governed by a set of prima facie duties—such as fidelity, reparation, gratitude and justice—which can conflict and must be balanced by practical judgment in particular situations. Ross preserves the deontological emphasis on duties while allowing moral decision-making to be sensitive to context.

When you explain deontology in answers, be clear about the difference between acting in accordance with duty and acting from duty, outline Kant’s formulations of the categorical imperative, and explain the role of reason and respect for persons. Use examples such as whether it is permissible to lie to protect someone’s life to show how a strict Kantian approach differs from a consequentialist one.

## Natural law: order, reason and human flourishing
Natural law theory traces its classical articulation to Aristotle and, more explicitly as a moral system, to Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas combined Christian theology with Aristotelian teleology to offer an account in which the universe is ordered by God and human beings are given a natural purpose. Human reason can discern basic goods and the human ends that contribute to flourishing. From this understanding come practical moral precepts. In Aquinas’s view there are primary precepts—such as the preservation of life, reproduction, education of offspring, living in society, and worship of God—from which more specific or secondary precepts are derived by reasoning about particulars. Natural law therefore links morality to human nature and objective goods rather than to mere preference or social convention.

Contemporary natural law theorists, like John Finnis, adapt the approach in a less explicitly theological way by identifying basic goods (for example life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, practical reasonableness, friendship, and religion) that practical reason aims to protect. Moral action consists in choosing ways of living that respect and promote these goods. Natural law is often associated with deontological-style prohibitions (for instance against acts that directly destroy life) but it grounds those prohibitions in a view of what constitutes human flourishing.

A strength of natural law is its appeal to objectivity: it offers an account of why certain actions are right or wrong by reference to human goods. Yet critics point to difficulties in establishing fixed human purposes in a pluralistic world and to challenges about deriving ought from is. When answering exam questions, show how natural law uses reason to move from observations about human life to moral norms, provide examples such as debates over euthanasia or contraception, and discussmodern revisions and difficulties in applying teleological thinking.

## Virtue ethics: character, habit and the good life
Virtue ethics accounts for morality by focusing on character rather than on rules or consequences. Its classical home is Aristotle. For Aristotle the aim of human life is eudaimonia—flourishing or human well-being—and virtues are the qualities that allow a person to live well. Virtues are acquired by habit: courage, temperance, justice and practical wisdom (phronesis) are not mere rules but dispositions that enable appropriate action in varying situations. The golden mean—the idea that virtue lies between two vices of excess and deficiency—is a distinctive feature of this ethics. Modern revivalists argue that virtue ethics better captures moral motivation and personal integrity than rule-based systems.

Contemporary virtue ethicists also emphasise the social, narrative and educational dimensions of moral formation. Alasdair MacIntyre, for example, stressed that virtues make sense within traditions and that moral reasoning is shaped by historical narratives of human practices. Elizabeth Anscombe and Philippa Foot critiqued modern moral philosophy for its over-reliance on legalistic rules and urged a return to character-centred ethics.

Virtue ethics handles dilemmas differently: rather than asking which act conforms to a rule, it asks what a virtuous person would do in the situation and how a choice contributes to flourishing. In exam answers, explain the central role of eudaimonia, the process of habituation, and the importance of phronesis. Use examples, such as how a courageous doctor balances risk and care, to show how virtue ethics produces different judgments from strict rule-following or consequentialist approaches.

## Applying the theories to moral problems: examples and contrasts
One effective way to show understanding is to apply each theory to the same case and contrast the outcomes. Consider the classic dilemma of lying to a murderer at the door to protect an innocent person. A strict Kantian deontologist who interprets the categorical imperative rigidly may forbid lying because the maxim fails universalisation and because lying treats the murderer as a means. Rossian deontology, however, might prioritise the duty of beneficence or protection and permit lying because other prima facie duties outweigh the duty of truth-telling in this circumstance. Natural law, if it holds the preservation of innocent life as a primary precept, will usually justify deception to save life because it promotes the basic good of life. Virtue ethics asks what a virtuous person with practical wisdom would do: someone guided by compassion and courage would act to protect the innocent, which may justify lying.

Another illustrative area is medical ethics. On euthanasia, deontology may prohibit active killing as violating a duty not to harm, whereas natural law traditionally forbids direct killing because it contravenes the primary precept to preserve life; some natural law theorists allow withholding extraordinary treatment. Virtue ethics approaches euthanasia by looking at what compassionate care and practical wisdom recommend in the particular case, with an emphasis on motives and character rather than fixed rules.

Sexual ethics offers further contrasts. Natural law historically grounds sexual morality in procreation and ordered relations, leading to conservative conclusions about contraception or same-sex relations. Modern deontologists may evaluate sexual acts by whether rules respect persons as ends and preserve autonomy and consent. Virtue ethicists consider whether sexual behaviour expresses virtues such as fidelity, respect and temperance or instead evidences vices.

When you use examples in essays, be explicit about how each theory justifies its conclusion, quote or name key theorists to support the account, and highlight practical differences that would matter to people making moral choices.

## Strengths and weaknesses: how to evaluate these theories
Evaluative assessment should move beyond description to weigh the power and limits of each account. Deontology’s strength lies in its clarity and its defence of human dignity and rights: it resists calculating morality purely by outcomes and explains why certain actions are intrinsically wrong. Its weakness is often said to be inflexibility; critics press Kantianism with demanding counterexamples (e.g. truth-telling to a murderer) and argue that rigid duties can lead to moral conflicts or outcomes that seem morally unacceptable. Ross addresses some of this by allowing prima facie duties, but critics ask how to justify the list of duties and how conflicts are resolved.

Natural law’s strength is its appeal to an objective moral order and its integration of ethics with human flourishing. It gives moral norms a substantive foundation and can motivate duties to protect life and community. Criticisms include difficulties in establishing a single account of human purposes across cultures, problems with deriving specific moral rules from broad teleological claims, and objections that natural law can be used to enforce conservative social values without adequate attention to individual autonomy. Contemporary revisions that frame basic goods non-theologically help respond to some of these concerns.

Virtue ethics is praised for restoring moral psychology, for emphasising moral education and for handling moral complexity with sensitivity to character and context. Its critics, however, challenge its action-guidance: students often ask, “What should I do right now?” and virtue ethics can appear less clear about specific prescriptions. There are also questions about cultural relativity of virtues and how to adjudicate between competing virtues. Defenders respond that phronesis and moral exemplars provide practical guidance and that virtues can be assessed against the human telos of flourishing.

A strong exam response will compare these strengths and weaknesses directly, show how they bear on particular moral issues, and conclude with a justified stance. You should aim to show breadth (an understanding of each theory) and depth (analysis of key objections and responses).

## Exam technique
In examination answers always begin by setting out clearly what you understand the question to ask and define the key terms needed for AO1 marks. For deontology, explain duty and the categorical imperative; for natural law, outline primary and secondary precepts and the role of practical reason; for virtue ethics, explain eudaimonia, virtues and phronesis. Use named thinkers to anchor your explanation—Kant, Ross, Aquinas, Finnis, Aristotle, Anscombe or MacIntyre—and give brief quotations or paraphrases where helpful. After accurate description, move to evaluation (AO2) by applying the theory to a concise example such as lying to save a life, euthanasia, or a justice case. Evaluate each theory’s internal coherence, its practicality, and how persuasive it is in handling your example. Compare theories directly: show where deontology disagrees with natural law or virtue ethics and why those differences matter for moral decision-making. Aim to balance knowledge and analysis throughout rather than saving all evaluation to the end.

Time-manage by allocating roughly one third of available time to accurate explanation and two thirds to evaluation and comparison for longer essays; for shorter questions adapt proportionally but never omit evaluation. Use paragraphs signposted by brief topic sentences to make your argument clear, and aim for a reasoned conclusion that answers the question directly—this should be justified, not merely asserted. Familiar exam phrasing such as “assess,” “evaluate,” or “to what extent” calls for critical engagement and a final judgement. Practice writing concise example-led answers under timed conditions, and revise key quotations, definitions and scholars so they can be used precisely in your responses.
