# New Testament (Luke or John): teachings of Jesus (A-level Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

Introduction
The Gospels of Luke and John offer two distinct windows on the teaching, identity and purpose of Jesus. For Pearson Edexcel A-level study you are expected to choose either Luke’s Gospel or the Fourth Gospel (John) and to explore key teachings, themes and texts. Luke is often read as a Gospel of social concern and moral instruction, emphasising Jesus’ ministry to the poor, outcasts and Gentiles; John presents a highly theological portrait, packed with symbolic language and a high Christology. Both Gospels include miracle stories, portrayals of discipleship and confrontations with religious and political authorities: understanding their literary shape, historical context and theological intent is essential for producing informed, balanced answers in examination essays.

Historical and literary context
Before analysing the teaching material it helps to locate each Gospel historically and literarily. Luke is conventionally placed in the late first century and thought to be written for a Gentile, possibly urban, audience. It is concerned with salvation history, the role of the Spirit and the inclusion of the marginalised; its author frames Jesus’ teaching with birth narratives, travel narratives, parables and apologetic passages. John is also a late first‑century product but differs radically in style: it uses long discourses, symbolic signs and theological reflection to present Jesus as the incarnate Word. Reading either Gospel effectively requires attention to genre: a Gospel is not a modern biography but a theological narrative that selects and shapes traditions about Jesus to communicate a particular purpose to a community. This affects how parables, sayings and miracles are to be interpreted — as theological signs as much as historical reports.

Luke: moral teaching, parables and the Kingdom of God
Luke’s portrait of Jesus stresses ethical demands and social reversals. Central to Luke is teaching about the Kingdom of God: it is presented in parables and actions as both a present reality and a future hope. The Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6) provides compressed moral teaching—blessings for the poor, instructions on love of enemies, and ethical priorities that invert social expectations. Luke 15’s trilogy of “lost” parables (the lost sheep, the lost coin, the prodigal son) emphasises God’s seeking love and the moral response of repentance and joy. Parables like the Good Samaritan and the Great Banquet explore neighbourliness and the radical hospitality demanded by God’s reign. Luke also links teaching to social action: concern for the poor, critique of wealth, and attention to caring for outcasts recur throughout the Gospel. In essays on Luke, you should show how individual sayings and parables function together to form a coherent moral vision and how Luke’s theology shapes his ethical emphases.

John: the ‘I am’ sayings, the Prologue and theological teaching
John’s distinctive contribution is its high‑theological language and its concentrated set of metaphors that reveal who Jesus is. The Prologue (John 1:1–18) frames the Gospel: the Word (Logos) who was with God and was God becomes flesh; light, life and revelation are central motifs. The “I am” sayings—“I am the bread of life,” “I am the light of the world,” “I am the good shepherd,” “I am the resurrection and the life,” “I am the way, the truth and the life,” and “I am the true vine”—are not merely descriptive but claim divine identity and function as invitations to faith. John uses “signs” (miracles) not primarily to prove power but to disclose Jesus’ identity and elicit response. When answering questions on John, focus on how Johannine language and symbolism serve theological ends: belief, eternal life, and the intimate relationship between the Father and the Son are constant themes.

Miracles in Luke and John: meaning and interpretation
Miracles appear in both Gospels but with differing emphases. Luke’s miracles often underline compassion and restoration: the raising of the widow’s son at Nain (Luke 7:11–17), healings of the lame and blind, and exorcisms demonstrate Jesus’ power to restore life and social place. Luke frequently connects miracles with mercy and the in-breaking of God’s salvation. John labels his miracles as “signs” (Greek: semeia); examples such as the changing of water into wine (John 2), the healing of the paralytic at the pool (John 5), and walking on the sea (John 6) are structured to point beyond the event to the identity and mission of Jesus. Interpretation debates are important to note: some readers emphasise historical‑critical questions about historicity and later theological shaping, while others emphasise the symbolic and pastoral intent. In examination answers, show awareness of these interpretative options and use specific miracle narratives to support your evaluative judgments about their meaning.

Discipleship, prayer, Sabbath and the place of women
Both Gospels address what it means to follow Jesus but with different tones. Luke stresses the demands of discipleship in social and ethical terms: followers must renounce wealth, show radical hospitality, and participate in mission. Luke’s portrayal of prayer and Sabbath controversies illustrates how Jesus reinterprets religious practice: prayer and praise are central (for example, the Magnificat tradition in Luke 1 and parables urging persistence in prayer), and Sabbath debates underline Jesus’ claim to authority over ritual law. John frames discipleship in terms of belief and abiding in Christ: the Farewell Discourses (John 14–17) emphasise love, mutual indwelling and the role of the Spirit as the continuing presence enabling faithful witness. John’s Gospel is also notable for its treatment of women; scenes such as the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4), the woman caught in adultery, and Mary at the tomb elevate women as significant witnesses to Jesus’ mission. In essays you should explore how discipleship is both ethical and spiritual, and how the Gospels’ portrayals of prayer, Sabbath practice and women contribute to contemporary theological reflection.

Conflict with authorities, crucifixion and resurrection: theology and purpose
Both Gospels present conflict with religious and political authorities, arrest, trial, crucifixion and resurrection, but their emphases vary. Luke situates Jesus’ suffering within salvation history, offering theological reflection on inclusion and forgiveness; his passion and resurrection narratives (Luke 22–24) emphasise vindication, witness and the fulfilment of scripture. John’s passion narrative (John 18–21) highlights Jesus’ control and purpose: Jesus is portrayed as sovereign even in arrest, repeatedly asserting truth claims before authorities. The resurrection is the decisive sign in both Gospels: for Luke it confirms God’s restorative action and commissions the disciples; for John it confirms Jesus’ identity as the risen Lord and brings the disciples to faith. When writing about these episodes, connect narrative detail to theology: consider purpose statements in the Gospels (Luke as apologetic for Gentiles and inclusion, John as “that you may believe”) and discuss how each Gospel frames death and resurrection as central to the meaning of Jesus’ mission.

Comparative approaches and scholarly debates
A good A-level response situates Gospel material in current interpretative debates. Key contrasts to explore include Luke’s emphasis on social justice and historical narrative versus John’s theological symbolism and high Christology. Debates often centre on issues such as the historical reliability of speeches and discourses, the function of parables, whether John preserves independent traditions or is theologically synthetic, and whether Luke’s portrayal reflects a particular community concern for Gentiles and the poor. Other important discussions concern the Kingdom of God: some interpreters stress an eschatological, future coming, others a present, realized dimension; Luke often negotiates both. On John, scholars debate the role of the “signs” and the extent to which the Gospel presupposes or reworks synoptic traditions. Demonstrating awareness of these debates, without needing exhaustive detail, strengthens evaluation and shows AO2-level critical engagement.

Teaching and classroom applications
When teaching these Gospels, encourage students to read passages attentively and to consider form and function: why does Luke include a particular parable in this setting? Why does John frame a story with “I am” language? Use close reading of set passages—Luke 6 (Sermon on the Plain), Luke 15, Luke 22–24 or John 1:1–18, John 6 and John 18–21—to practise linking textual detail to theological claims. Classroom activities that compare parallel traditions (e.g. the feeding miracles across Gospels) help students see both continuity and diversity. Foster critical discussion about interpretation: ask learners to defend literal, symbolic, historical or theological readings of a miracle. Finally, practice essay planning that integrates knowledge of context, textual detail and evaluation; this habit directly translates to examination success.

## Exam technique
Begin every answer with a short introduction that directly addresses the question and outlines your approach. For questions on Luke or John, state which Gospel you are using and briefly explain its distinctives (e.g. Luke’s concern for the poor; John’s high Christology). Use paragraphs to organise the answer: a typical three-part structure for a 30-mark extended question is to spend the first part demonstrating detailed knowledge (AO1), the second part developing analysis and links to wider context and scholarship (AO1/AO2), and the third part providing critical evaluation and a balanced conclusion (AO2). Always support points with specific textual evidence: cite chapter and verse (for instance, Luke 15; John 1:1–14; Luke 22–24; John 18–21) and explain how the passage supports your argument rather than letting citations stand alone.

Timing is crucial: for a 30-mark question allow roughly 35–40 minutes, leaving 5–10 minutes for planning and final review. Spend the planning time writing a quick skeleton: introduction, two or three main analytical points with textual support, and an evaluative conclusion. In evaluation, show awareness of alternative readings and the limits of evidence; for example, discuss both the theological intent of John’s Prologue and the historical‑critical questions about its composition. Use scholarly viewpoints to deepen evaluation—summarise positions (for example, eschatological vs realised Kingdom; historical vs theological readings of signs) and explain their relevance to your judgement.

Language and presentation matter. Use accurate theological and biblical terminology (terms such as Christology, Kingdom of God, parable, sign, incarnation, discipleship) and ensure clarity of expression. Aim for balanced answers: demonstrate knowledge, then critically weigh strengths and weaknesses before offering a justified conclusion that answers the question directly. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions. Regularly self‑assess against the exam board’s level descriptors: ensure you are selecting relevant material, developing reasoned argument, and offering coherent evaluation to reach the higher mark bands.
