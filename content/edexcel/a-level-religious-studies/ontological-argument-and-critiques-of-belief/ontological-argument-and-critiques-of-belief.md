# Ontological argument and critiques of belief (A-level Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction: what the ontological argument sets out to do
The ontological argument is a distinctive philosophical strategy: it tries to move from the meaning of the word “God” to the conclusion that God exists. Unlike cosmological or teleological arguments that appeal to experience of the world, the ontological argument is a priori and typically deductive. It asks whether the concept of a maximally great or supremely perfect being contains existence as part of its nature. If it does, the argument claims, then denying God’s existence becomes incoherent. This topic sits in the Pearson Edexcel A-level specification under the study of philosophical arguments about the existence of God and is tested through analysis of key versions, their strengths, and the major historical and contemporary criticisms.

## Key versions of the ontological argument
The best-known original form is Anselm of Canterbury’s argument in the Proslogion. Anselm defines God as "that than which nothing greater can be conceived" and reasons that existing in reality is greater than existing only in the understanding; therefore, if God exists in the understanding, God must exist in reality. Descartes later offered a similar a priori move, treating God's existence as contained in the clear and distinct idea of a supremely perfect being: perfection implies existence, since non-existence would be an imperfection. In the twentieth century philosophers revived the argument using modal logic. Norman Malcolm and Alvin Plantinga recast the claim in terms of necessity and possible worlds: if a maximally great being is possible—that is, there is at least one possible world in which a necessarily existing maximal being obtains—then such a being exists in every possible world, including the actual one. Plantinga’s modal ontological argument tightened the logical form and shifted the debate toward questions about modal premises (possibility and necessity) rather than the move from concept to existence alone.

## Key philosophical concepts and how they matter
Several technical terms are central to understanding and evaluating the ontological argument. A priori knowledge is knowledge independent of sensory experience; the ontological argument aims to be a priori. A deductive argument, if valid and sound, guarantees its conclusion if the premises are true. The notion of necessary existence (a property some philosophers attribute to God) means something could not fail to exist; contingent existence, by contrast, is existence that depends on conditions. Another crucial distinction is between analytic truths (true by meaning, such as “all bachelors are unmarried”) and synthetic truths (true by how the world is). Kant famously argued that existence is not a predicate—meaning that to say something exists adds nothing to the concept of the thing—so you cannot define something into existence by adding existence as a property. Understanding these concepts helps to see why the ontological argument produces such intense philosophical debate: it probes the limits of concepts, language, and logical necessity.

## Strengths and modern defenses
Supporters of the ontological argument point to its logical elegance and its ability to clarify what is at stake in theological language. The argument is valued by some as showing the coherence and explanatory power of the theistic concept: if God is maximally great it makes sense to treat necessity of existence as part of that maximal greatness. Modal versions shift the debate to whether a maximally great being is possible, which can be defended by pointing to the intuitive plausibility of such a being or by arguing that impossibility would require contradiction. Plantinga’s formulation also avoids some earlier criticisms by using contemporary modal logic and by distinguishing between existence claims that are analytic and those that are modal. For students, it helps to be able to present a clear reconstruction of a modal ontological argument and to explain why its premises might be plausible to a theist without relying on sensory evidence.

## Classical criticisms and the most important rejoinders
Two historic lines of critique are indispensable. Gaunilo, a contemporary of Anselm, argued by parody: one can define the “greatest conceivable island,” but that does not cause such an island to exist. Gaunilo’s point is that the ontological move can be applied to absurdities, so the method must be suspect. Anselm’s response was that God is unique as a maximally great being whereas worldly things like islands are contingent and limited, but the exchange shows the importance of defining the scope and kind of concept being used. Kant’s objection is more decisive for many philosophers: existence, he argued, is not a real predicate that adds to the concept of a thing; it cannot increase the greatness of a being to say it exists. If that is right, then the ontological move from concept to existence is invalid. Modern defenders have attempted responses: some reinterpret existence as a second-order property tied to modal considerations, others challenge Kant’s account by arguing that necessary existence is a genuine property and that Kant’s move does not capture modal claims. Still, Kant’s critique remains powerful for students to explain and evaluate.

Beyond these, empiricist and logical positivist critics argued that meaningful claims about existence require verification by experience. Ayer and the verification principle held that religious statements that cannot be empirically verified are literally meaningless. Philosophers like Antony Flew later pressed a falsification challenge: if religious claims are not disconfirmable by any possible evidence, they are not genuine assertions. Responses to such critiques include appeals to the different functions of religious language, as Wittgenstein’s idea of language games suggests, and R. M. Hare’s concept of "blik" to show that deeply held but non-falsifiable worldviews still have personality and behavior-shaping function. These debates open the door to repositioning the ontological argument not simply as a logical proof but as part of a larger conversation about the role and form of religious claims.

## Non-existence of God and broader critiques of religious belief
The specification asks students to engage with critiques of religious belief more generally, not just formal objections to specific arguments. Philosophical atheism and agnosticism rest on a range of intellectual traditions. David Hume raised empiricist concerns about the limits of inference from cause to ultimate causes; Bertrand Russell appealed to logical and evidential standards about claims for which there is insufficient evidence. The problem of evil remains the single most powerful empirical and moral objection to the hypothesis of an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God: if such a God exists, why is there pointless suffering? Theodicies and defenses—from Augustine’s free-will theodicy to Irenaean soul-making accounts and process theology—try to reconcile suffering with divine attributes, but critics press on the plausibility and moral cost of those explanations. Sociological and psychological critiques, such as those of Marx, Freud and Durkheim, treat religion as ideology, wish-fulfillment, or social glue, thereby explaining religious belief without invoking truth of religious propositions. These approaches do not always aim to disprove God by logic, but they offer alternate explanations of why religion persists and how religious belief functions in human life. For an A-level answer to be strong, it must engage with both the intellectual force of such critiques and the theist’s possible responses.

## Responses, adjustments and implications for belief
Defenders of religion can respond at multiple levels. Some accept limits to traditional metaphysical proofs and adopt fideism, the view that religious belief rests primarily on faith rather than rational proof. Others reframe theistic claims in less metaphysically loaded terms—seeing God as a grounding of moral values or as a necessary explanatory principle for certain kinds of intelligibility. Process theologians and non-classical theists change traditional divine attributes, making God not omnipotent in the classical sense but persuasive, thus altering how objections like the problem of evil apply. Philosophical work on religious language—analogy, symbol, and post-linguistic approaches—also offers ways to reinterpret the force and meaning of theological claims, which can blunt logical criticisms that assume a literalist reading. For students, it is valuable to illustrate how a critic’s challenge may be answered both by tightening arguments (for example in modal logic) and by widening the theological framework to reconfigure what it means to believe in God.

## Exam technique
When an Edexcel question asks you to assess the ontological argument or critiques of religious belief, begin by defining key terms: what kind of argument it is (a priori, deductive), what “necessary existence” or “maximally great being” means, and what form of critique you are considering. A strong opening sets the map for the essay. For a 30-mark question, aim to spend the first third of your time on clear explanation (AO1): accurately reconstruct Anselm’s basic argument and one or two variants (Descartes, modal/Plantinga), showing how premises lead to conclusion. Use precise language and name primary critics such as Gaunilo and Kant, explaining their objections in the critic’s own terms. In the middle section (AO2) present strengths and weaknesses: explain why modal versions are seen as improvements and why Kant’s “existence is not a predicate” remains persuasive. Bring in broader critiques of religious belief—Hume, logical positivists, Flew, Marx, Freud—and show how they differ from purely formal objections. Throughout, show engagement with the question by evaluating, weighing up how decisive each objection is and whether proposed theistic responses succeed.

Conclude with a balanced judgement that answers the question directly: you might argue that the ontological argument is historically and philosophically influential but ultimately unpersuasive as a standalone proof, or that while some critiques are decisive, others open constructive theological reformulations. Support your verdict with reasons and, where appropriate, a reflection on the different kinds of standards (logical, empirical, existential) used in the debate. Use precise examples, refer to scholars by name, and keep your writing clear and well structured. Time-manage by planning a short outline, then writing focused paragraphs that alternate explanation and evaluation. This approach matches Edexcel’s assessment objectives and helps to demonstrate both accurate knowledge and critical judgement.
