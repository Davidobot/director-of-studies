# Medical ethics and bioethics (A-level Religious Studies Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction: what medical ethics and bioethics cover
Medical ethics and bioethics explore moral questions that arise in medicine, healthcare and biological science. At A-level you should treat these subjects as both practical and philosophical: they involve real-life dilemmas about life and death, but they also invite theoretical reflection about values, rights and the nature of persons. Typical topics include abortion, euthanasia and end-of-life care, organ transplantation, allocation of scarce medical resources, reproductive technologies such as IVF and surrogacy, and novel developments such as genetic engineering. To do well you will need to combine clear factual knowledge of the issues with the ability to evaluate moral arguments from different perspectives: secular ethical theories, religious teachings and policy-relevant principles.

## Core principles and ethical theories
Begin any ethical discussion by setting out the core principles most commonly used in medical ethics: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that competent patients make informed choices about their care. Beneficence and non-maleficence require healthcare professionals to act in patients’ best interests and to avoid harm; these can sometimes conflict, for example when an intervention will relieve suffering but shorten life. Justice directs attention to fair distribution of medical resources. Alongside these principles you should be familiar with ethical theories used to justify positions. Utilitarianism evaluates actions by their overall consequences and is commonly used to justify resource-allocation decisions. Deontological approaches (for example Kantian-style duty ethics or versions of divine command theory) emphasise duties and rights regardless of outcomes. Natural Moral Law and virtue ethics give alternative frameworks: Natural Moral Law links moral rules to human nature and purposes, while virtue ethics focuses on the moral character of agents and the development of virtues such as compassion. Situation ethics and casuistry appear in applied contexts where rules may be weighed against particular circumstances. When discussing any case, show how these principles and theories lead to different recommendations and where they support or conflict with each other.

## Abortion and reproductive technologies
Abortion and reproductive technologies are a major area where ethical, legal and religious views intersect. Abortion raises questions about the moral status of the embryo or foetus, personhood, rights of the pregnant woman, and duties owed by the state and medical professionals. Some religious traditions emphasise the sanctity of every human life, often leading to strong restrictions on abortion, while other traditions or secular perspectives allow abortion when the rights, health or life of the mother are at stake. Arguments about personhood often hinge on criteria such as viability, sentience or the presence of certain cognitive capacities; you should be prepared to explain and evaluate these criteria rather than assuming a single answer.

Reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete donation, surrogacy and mitochondrial replacement create further ethical puzzles about parenthood, identity, commodification and the welfare of children. Advances in genetic testing and pre-implantation diagnosis allow selection against serious genetic conditions, which some see as a moral good and others worry may lead to eugenic practices or discrimination against disabled people. When writing on these topics, combine an account of the technologies with an analysis of the ethical stakes, referencing how utilitarian calculations about wellbeing, rights-based arguments about autonomy and religious commitments about naturalness and procreation produce contrasting conclusions.

## Euthanasia, assisted dying and end-of-life care
End-of-life issues require careful attention to language: voluntary active euthanasia is the intentional ending of a life at a patient’s request; assisted suicide involves providing the means for a patient to end their own life; withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatment is sometimes described as allowing death to occur. Many debates turn on distinctions between killing and letting die, intention and foresight, and the doctrine of double effect, which permits actions that have a harmful side-effect if the harmful effect is not intended and there is a proportionate reason.

Religious responses are diverse. Some Christian traditions stress the sanctity of life and oppose any intentional killing, though they may accept palliative sedation and withdrawal of disproportionate treatments. Islamic ethics generally emphasises preservation of life while recognising limits to burdensome treatment; Jewish ethics often prioritises saving life but involves detailed rules about when life-sustaining measures may be withdrawn. Secular arguments for legalising assisted dying focus on autonomy and relief of suffering, whereas opposing secular arguments highlight risks of abuse, slippery slopes and potential pressure on vulnerable patients. High-profile legal cases and public debates—about individuals who sought legal permission to die or about parents disputing withdrawal of treatment for critically ill children—provide material for evaluation. Use such cases to illustrate how legal, medical and ethical claims interact, and to show the complexities that arise when theory meets practice.

## Genetic engineering and emerging technologies
The arrival of new biological technologies has pushed bioethics onto global agendas. Genetic engineering techniques, including gene editing, create opportunities to prevent disease but also raise concerns about unintended harms, germline modification, fairness of access and the possibility of enhancing traits for non-medical reasons. Debates often focus on the distinction between therapy and enhancement: curing a life-threatening genetic disorder is widely seen as ethically permissible by many, while enhancing intelligence or appearance provokes stronger objections.

Religious and philosophical analyses contribute important reservations and endorsements. Many religious voices worry about ‘playing God’ or altering creation, while other religious thinkers emphasise human stewardship and the moral imperative to relieve suffering. Utilitarian reasoning may support interventions that increase overall wellbeing, whereas deontological and virtue-based critiques emphasise dignity, consent and respect for persons. When you discuss emerging technologies, show awareness of uncertainty, the need for robust regulation, and the ethical importance of long-term social consequences such as widening health inequalities.

## Allocation of scarce resources and organ transplantation
Decisions about who receives limited treatments—organ transplants, intensive care beds or new expensive drugs—raise acute ethical tensions between maximizing overall benefit and respecting individuals’ claims. Utilitarian approaches favour allocation rules that maximize total benefit, for example through quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), while theories of justice require fair procedures and attention to equal respect. Priority systems based on need, prognosis, waiting time or lottery each embody different moral values. Religious perspectives often emphasise the inherent dignity of each person and the obligation to care for the vulnerable, which can clash with strictly utilitarian allocation.

Organ transplantation introduces further specific issues: consent models (opt-in versus opt-out), living donation and the permissibility of financial incentives. The international trafficking in organs and exploitation of donors from poorer communities raise concerns about justice and exploitation. When writing about these matters, consider concrete policy alternatives and their ethical costs and benefits, and evaluate them by reference to the ethical principles and theories already outlined. Use contemporary examples, such as debates about presumed consent or crises in organ supply, to ground theoretical discussion in practical dilemmas.

## Neonatal care, palliative medicine and clinical decision-making
Neonatal ethics deals with decisions about extremely premature or severely disabled newborns. Questions include when to provide or withhold intensive care, how to assess best interests for patients who cannot speak for themselves, and the roles of parents and clinicians. Palliative medicine focuses on relieving suffering when cure is no longer possible; it raises questions about the permissible limits of sedation and the use of pain relief that may have life-shortening effects. Clinical decision-making also involves consent, competence and the role of advance directives. Ethical practice requires clear communication, sensitivity to family values, and mechanisms for resolving disagreements, such as ethics committees and legal recourse.

Religious traditions offer resources for these conversations: for example, concepts of stewardship and compassion may support palliative care, while doctrines about the sanctity of life can shape positions on aggressive neonatal intervention. In evaluation, avoid simplistic generalisations: different religious communities and medical professionals often hold nuanced, context-sensitive positions. Show how ethical frameworks guide practical protocols and how ethical analysis can inform guidelines that balance respect for life, relief of suffering and fairness.

## Exam technique
In examinations, allocate time to set out relevant facts clearly and then to analyse and evaluate. For AO1, demonstrate accurate knowledge of the medical and scientific background as well as the relevant ethical principles and religious teachings; use correct terminology (autonomy, sanctity of life, doctrine of double effect, personhood, etc.). For AO2, structure your answer so that you present alternative viewpoints and then weigh them against one another, using ethical theories to support evaluation. Link theory to practice by discussing concrete cases or policies and by considering consequences, rights and duties. Avoid long descriptive passages without analysis; examiners reward focused argument, clear conclusions and the ability to recognise strengths and weaknesses in opposing positions. Finally, practise past questions under timed conditions, plan answers quickly at the start of the exam, and conclude with a balanced judgement that reflects the complexity of medical ethical issues.
