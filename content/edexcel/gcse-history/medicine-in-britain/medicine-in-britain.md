# Medicine in Britain (c1250–present) (GCSE History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: what this topic is about and why it matters
This topic traces how ideas about disease, treatment and public health changed in Britain from the medieval period to the present, and how those changes affected people’s lives. It asks you to compare medical knowledge and practice across centuries, to understand the role of individuals and institutions, and to explain why particular advances happened at particular times. You will study familiar case studies — the Black Death, the Great Plague, William Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood, John Snow’s work on cholera, Florence Nightingale’s nursing reforms and the development of penicillin — and use them to explain wider patterns of continuity and change. The linked historic environment for Paper 1 is the British sector of the Western Front, 1914–18, where the realities of modern industrial warfare accelerated surgical and medical innovations. Understanding this topic helps you see how science, technology, government policy and social attitudes work together to improve (and sometimes limit) health and care.

## The process of change: the factors that shape medicine
When you study medicine through time you should focus on three broad kinds of factor: individuals and institutions, science and technology, and attitudes in society. Individuals such as Jenner, Nightingale, Harvey and Fleming drove discoveries or changes in practice, but their achievements depended on institutions — universities, hospitals, the Royal Society, the army and, in the twentieth century, the state through legislation and the NHS. Science and technology — the printing press and anatomical texts in the Renaissance, the microscope and Germ Theory in the nineteenth century, anaesthetics, antiseptics, blood transfusion and diagnostic machines in the twentieth century — gradually made accurate diagnosis and safer surgery possible. Attitudes in society shaped priorities: religious beliefs and superstitions guided medieval explanations of illness; the Enlightenment encouraged observation and experiment; Victorian public health campaigns reflected new ideas about the role of government. These factors often interacted: new technology could change public expectations, which in turn led to institutional reform and legal change. When explaining change, think about continuity as well as difference — for example, community care and herbal remedies persisted even as hospitals expanded.

## c1250–c1500: medieval medicine and the Black Death
In medieval England medical thinking was a mix of religious, supernatural and classical ideas. Many people believed illness could be punishment from God or the result of demonic influence, so prayer, fasting and pilgrimages were common responses. At the same time the medical theory that dominated learned medicine was that of the Four Humours, inherited from Galen: health depended on balance among blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. Physicians trained at universities used this framework; barber-surgeons carried out simpler operations; apothecaries prepared remedies; hospitals provided charity care rather than modern medical treatment. Public health measures were primitive, but people attempted to purify the air (miasma) and used herbal remedies at home.

The Black Death of 1348–49 was a turning point in everyday experience even if its long-term impact on medical knowledge was limited. Medieval responses ranged from religious processions to attempts at isolation and folk remedies; some local authorities imposed quarantines or closed markets, but contagion was not universally understood in scientific terms. The crisis revealed limitations in medieval medical systems: hospitals were overwhelmed, trained physicians were few, and explanations were often inadequate. Nevertheless, the Black Death had huge social and economic consequences that indirectly affected medicine, for example by changing labour relations and increasing the availability of resources for some types of care.

## c1500–c1700: the Medical Renaissance and changing ideas
The period often called the Medical Renaissance saw greater emphasis on observation, dissection and the recovery of classical learning. The printing press allowed medical texts to be shared more widely and the Royal Society promoted experimental approaches. Andreas Vesalius’s anatomical work challenged some of Galen’s errors and encouraged surgeons to study the body directly. Thomas Sydenham promoted careful observation and classification of illnesses, improving diagnosis. William Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood in the early seventeenth century transformed understanding of the cardiovascular system and influenced later physiological research.

Treatment methods still relied on older ideas in many cases — bloodletting and purging remained in use — but new surgical knowledge and improving techniques began to change what was possible. Epidemics continued: the Great Plague of London in 1665 showed how cities responded with quarantines, the shutting of theatres and markets, and attempts at sanitation, while medical observations recorded by physicians contributed to later public health thinking. The Medical Renaissance did not produce instant transformation, but it laid intellectual foundations and a culture of empirical enquiry that would be crucial later.

## c1700–c1900: germ theory, public health and professional reform
The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries brought major structural and scientific changes. Industrialisation and urbanisation produced crowded cities with poor sanitation and recurring outbreaks of infectious disease. In response, public health moved from charitable initiatives to state involvement. Edwin Chadwick and others campaigned for sanitary reform; the Public Health Act of 1875 in Britain required local authorities to provide clean water, sewers and proper waste disposal, which gradually reduced disease rates.

Scientific breakthroughs were central. The development of the microscope and the work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch established Germ Theory in the mid-to-late nineteenth century, replacing miasma theories in explaining many infections. This changed medical practice: antiseptics (championed by Joseph Lister) made surgery far safer, and anaesthetics (from the 1840s) allowed longer and more complex operations. Nursing underwent transformation through Florence Nightingale, whose experience in the Crimean War led to professional training, improved hygiene in hospitals and the idea that nursing and hospital organisation could save lives. Edward Jenner’s work on smallpox vaccination at the end of the eighteenth century offered the first systematic, preventive immunisation, and although his methods were initially controversial, vaccination became an effective public health tool.

Practical reforms of prisons and hospitals, the emergence of a more professional medical workforce, and beginnings of state involvement prepared Britain for the twentieth century. Yet many treatments remained crude by modern standards and access to care varied widely by class and place.

## c1900–present: antibiotics, the NHS, and high-tech medicine
The twentieth century saw the most rapid and sustained improvements in life expectancy and medical capability. The discovery of antibiotics began with Alexander Fleming’s identification of penicillin in 1928, and its development for widespread clinical use by Florey and Chain in the 1940s revolutionised the treatment of bacterial infections. Vaccination programmes expanded and, combined with better living standards and sanitation, they dramatically reduced child mortality and infectious disease.

World War I and II also accelerated medical innovation and organisation. The trauma of millions of combat casualties required new techniques in surgery, infection control and blood transfusion. In civilian life, the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 marked a major institutional change: healthcare became available to all based on need rather than ability to pay, altering patterns of access and expectations of the state. High-technology medicine — imaging scans, organ transplants, chemotherapy, genetic testing and minimally invasive surgery — became routine by the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, while public health campaigns and screening programmes addressed lifestyle diseases such as lung cancer and heart disease.

Continuity remains, too: prevention and community care continue to be important, and inequalities in health persist. The history of medicine is therefore a story of tremendous progress shaped by scientific discovery, organised healthcare and social change, but also by ongoing debates about resources, ethics and priorities.

## The British sector of the Western Front, 1914–18: injuries, treatment and the trenches (historic environment)
The British sector of the Western Front is the specified historic environment linked to this thematic study. The trenches and the battlefield context shaped not only the types of injuries seen — blast wounds, shrapnel, crushed limbs, gas injuries and shell shock — but also how medicine was organised. The chain of evacuation was a defining feature: stretcher-bearers collected the wounded from the front line to aid posts and dressing stations, then to casualty clearing stations and base hospitals, sometimes behind the lines in France or back to Britain. The Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), Red Cross nurses and volunteer organisations worked together in an often-chaotic system.

The Western Front was important for medical innovation. The Thomas splint dramatically reduced deaths from fractured femurs by immobilising limbs and preventing bleeding and shock. Mobile x-ray units were introduced to locate bullets and shrapnel, improving surgical outcomes. Surgeons developed new techniques for wound debridement and for managing infection; the use of antiseptics and later sulphonamides and blood transfusion improved survival. The Arras underground hospital and the experimentation with blood storage and transfusion for the Battle of Cambrai illustrate how necessity drove rapid advances. The historic environment also shows the limits of contemporary medicine: infection remained a major killer, and psychological trauma was poorly understood and often labelled as shell shock. When answering historic environment questions, focus on how place, technology and organisation determine what medical care was possible and how sources (letters, medical reports, photographs, army records) can be used to investigate these issues.

## Sources and interpretations: using evidence in enquiries
Exam questions will test your ability to select, evaluate and use sources, and to understand later interpretations. For the thematic study and the Western Front historic environment you will need to know both local and national sources. Local sources for the trenches include personal diaries, letters from soldiers and nurses, hospital and regimental medical records, photographs and contemporary maps. National sources include army records, official medical reports, government documents and newspaper accounts. For earlier periods, sources range from medical texts, physician casebooks, parish records and hospital foundation records to archaeological evidence and municipal reports.

When you analyse a source, consider its provenance (who produced it, when and why), its content (what it says and what it omits), its value (how it helps your enquiry) and its limitations (bias, perspective, intended audience). For usefulness questions, explicitly weigh strengths and weaknesses and relate them to the specific enquiry. For interpretation questions, explain why later historians might disagree: they may use different evidence, write from different viewpoints, or emphasise different factors such as long-term social change versus the role of individuals. Practising source analysis with the sorts of materials listed in your specification will build the skills you need for AO3 and AO4.

## Exam technique
Know the structure of each paper and the Assessment Objectives you are being tested on. For Paper 1 historic environment questions, Answer Question 1(a)/(b) concisely but with specific detail; for the source-based Question 2, use your knowledge to assess the usefulness of both sources for the named enquiry and be explicit about provenance and context, then suggest a focused follow-up enquiry that could be answered using one of the sources. In the thematic study questions practise linking two time periods for similarity/difference and use named examples from different centuries. For change questions, structure your answer around causes, turning points and consequences, making connections between the factors listed in the specification (individuals, institutions, science and attitudes).

In Paper 2 period and depth study answers, follow the command of the question. For causation focus on the balance of causes and signpost short- and long-term factors; for analytical narrative questions, organise your answer as a sequence of linked events with explanation rather than a list of facts. When asked for significance or consequence, explain what difference an event or person made compared with other factors.

Paper 3 requires careful source analysis and interpretation work. For AO3 source questions practise making quick inferences and supporting them with close reading and context. For AO4 interpretation questions, compare interpretations by highlighting the key differences and offering plausible reasons based on evidence, historian perspective or later changing values. When asked to evaluate an interpretation, use the other interpretation and your own knowledge to support a balanced judgement.

Across all papers manage your time. Read questions carefully, underline key terms, plan briefly before writing and make sure each paragraph has a clear point supported with specific evidence. Use precise historical vocabulary and where relevant include short, focused context (dates, locations, named individuals) to show depth of knowledge. For extended answers develop a sustained line of reasoning, include several well-chosen pieces of evidence, and finish with a concise conclusion that answers the question. Finally, practise past papers under exam conditions, get feedback on structure and content, and pay attention to SPaG in longer answers — clear expression and specialist terms won’t earn marks by themselves, but poor spelling and grammar can lose up to four marks in the extended questions.
