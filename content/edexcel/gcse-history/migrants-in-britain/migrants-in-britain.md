# Migrants in Britain (c800–present) (GCSE History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: what this topic covers and why it matters
The story of migrants in Britain from around 800 to the present examines who moved to and within these islands, why they came and what difference they made. Migration can be voluntary or forced, short-term or permanent, internal or international; the focus here is mainly on the pull factors that drew people to Britain while also recognising the push factors that drove them from their homelands. Studying this theme helps you understand long-term change and continuity in British society: how different groups were received, how they contributed to trade, industry and culture, and how institutions such as the Church, the state and the law responded. The topic brings together political, economic, social and cultural history and encourages you to compare very different periods—from Viking settlers in medieval York to post‑war Caribbean communities in Notting Hill—so you can explain patterns of migration and its consequences over more than a thousand years.

## The process of change: key factors to remember
When you study migrants in Britain you should think about four key factors that help explain why migration happened and how migrants were treated: institutions (including government and Church), religion, economic influences, and attitudes in society. These factors often worked together. For example, monarchs and local elites needed money and manpower, which could attract skilled migrants; religion sometimes provided protection or exclusion; economic growth in towns and later in industrial cities created demand for labour; and social attitudes—ranging from welcome to hostility—shaped migrants’ everyday lives. Over the centuries patterns of migration changed: early medieval movements involved settlement and conquest, the early modern period brought religious refugees and skilled artisans, the nineteenth century saw mass movement driven by industrialisation and empire, and the twentieth century featured decolonisation, labour migration to rebuild after the Second World War, and the complexities of refugee movements and changing nationality laws. Always be ready to explain both continuity, such as long-standing urban attraction, and change, such as the legal frameworks and public debates that developed in modern times.

## c800–c1500: migration in medieval England
From the Viking raids and settlements of the ninth and tenth centuries to the Norman Conquest in 1066 and the arrival of Jewish communities and continental traders, medieval England experienced a variety of migrations. Vikings settled in parts of northern and eastern England, creating the Danelaw and shaping towns such as York; they were drawn by opportunities for land, trade and settlement as well as by political fragmentation across Europe. The Norman Conquest brought a ruling class from across the Channel, changing landholding, administration and architecture, and offering new opportunities for those who adapted. Jewish communities established themselves as moneylenders and merchants, but their legal status as ‘aliens’ made them vulnerable to exploitation and violent attacks, most notably the pogroms around the coronation of Richard I in 1189–90. Migration affected trade, culture and the built environment: newcomers introduced crafts, new commercial links and urban growth. At the same time migrants’ experiences varied widely; some prospered, others faced hostility or restrictive laws. The Black Death in the mid-fourteenth century altered labour markets and could improve bargaining power for some migrants, while also disrupting communities.

## c1500–c1700: migration in early modern England
The early modern period saw continued movement from Europe and beyond, with religion an especially powerful motive. Protestants fleeing persecution in the Low Countries, such as Flemish and Walloon clothworkers, settled in ports like Sandwich and Canterbury, bringing skills that boosted local industries. Huguenot refugees from France arrived in the seventeenth century, contributing to silk-weaving, finance and the arts in towns around London. At the same time the emerging English state and economy were becoming increasingly outward-looking: merchants, privateers and trading companies expanded global connections, and ideas and people moved with them. Enslaved Africans were brought to British colonies during this period, producing an early and tragic connection between migration and empire. The social and legal status of migrants depended on the politics of the day and on local attitudes; some were welcomed for the economic skills they brought, while others faced suspicion or legal limits. Religious difference was a frequent source of both refuge and tension in these years.

## c1700–c1900: migration, empire and industrial Britain
The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries brought mass movements shaped by the Industrial Revolution, empire and famine. Irish migration to British towns and ports increased dramatically in the nineteenth century, especially during and after the Great Famine of the 1840s, leading to large Irish communities in cities such as Liverpool. Jewish migrants fleeing persecution in Eastern Europe settled in the East End of London, forming tight-knit communities and trading networks while also encountering anti‑Semitism. Britain’s growing empire and transatlantic trade meant more people moved across the globe, sometimes as indentured workers, sometimes as enslaved people whose forced migration had a huge economic and human impact. Industrial urban centres attracted migrants for jobs in factories, docks and workshops, reshaping the urban environment with overcrowding, new forms of work and social challenges. Responses to migrants were mixed: newspapers and political debate often reflected anxiety and at times hostility, but migrants also reshaped local economies, politics and culture, leaving legacies visible in urban neighbourhoods and industries.

## c1900–present: empire, decolonisation and modern migration
The twentieth century brought major changes in the sources and scale of migration. Legal frameworks such as the Aliens Act of 1905 and the British Nationality Acts of the twentieth century altered who could enter and claim rights in Britain. Two world wars created forced movements and new labour needs. After the Second World War, Britain’s post‑war reconstruction and the legacy of empire encouraged migration from the Caribbean, South Asia and other parts of the Commonwealth. The arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush in 1948 became symbolic of this period, as Caribbean men and women responded to invitations to help rebuild Britain. The mid-twentieth century also saw refugee movements and the growth of asylum claims. Race relations became a prominent political issue, prompting the Race Relations Act of 1965 and further legislation. Migrants contributed to the economy, revitalised local culture and changed the urban landscape, but they also faced racism, policing tensions and contested politics. Case studies such as Bristol in the mid-twentieth century and the growth of Asian communities in Leicester from 1945 illustrate how migrants both experienced exclusion and created new social networks, businesses and political activism that transformed British towns and cities.

## Notting Hill, c1948–c1970: the historic environment in focus
Notting Hill provides a vivid local study of post-war migration, community, conflict and culture. After 1948 Caribbean migrants settled in parts of London including Notting Hill, attracted by housing and labour opportunities in a Britain rebuilding after the war. Poor housing conditions—houses of multiple occupation, overcrowding and exploitative landlords such as the notorious Peter Rachman—created anxieties and tensions. The area became known for Caribbean shops, cafes, nightclubs and the early development of the Portobello Market, which helped establish a visible Caribbean cultural presence. Notting Hill also became a flashpoint for racism and police-community conflict: the murder of Kelso Cochrane in 1959 and the Notting Hill Riots of 1958 exposed entrenched hostility and the influence of far-right groups. Yet the area was also a centre of political and cultural activism. Claudia Jones and the West Indian Gazette championed Caribbean voices and organised community events that evolved into the Notting Hill Carnival, while figures such as Frank Crichlow supported black culture and civil rights. The Mangrove Restaurant became a hub for activists and ultimately led to the high-profile Mangrove Nine trial, showing how local struggles fed into national debates about policing and race. Studying Notting Hill requires you to use local sources—newspapers aimed at the Caribbean community, council and police records, oral histories and photographs—alongside national records to evaluate questions about immigration, housing, racism and resistance.

## Using sources: strengths, weaknesses and enquiry skills
When investigating migration you will work with a wide range of sources. Local records—census returns, housing and employment registers, personal memoirs and photographs—are excellent for understanding everyday experiences and neighbourhood change, but they can be limited by bias, incomplete survival and local perspectives. National sources—parliamentary records, national newspapers, government reports and legislation—offer insight into official policy and public debate but may overlook lived experience or present the viewpoint of elites. Contemporary sources such as police reports or newspapers can be sensationalist or partial, while oral testimonies give human detail but reflect memory and later reinterpretation. A strong historical enquiry combines different types of evidence, recognises what each source can and cannot tell you, and uses contextual knowledge to assess usefulness. Always frame focused questions for an enquiry, select sources suited to those questions, and explain how sources support or challenge your conclusions.

## Exam technique
To succeed in the Paper 1 thematic and historic environment questions you must combine knowledge with careful use of sources and clear, balanced argument. For the historic environment section begin by practising short descriptive answers that identify key features of the site and its context. When you evaluate sources, first read them carefully and identify what each source can tell you about the specific enquiry; then place each source in context and consider its purpose, provenance and limitation before judging its usefulness. When suggesting a follow-up enquiry, pick a question that fills a real gap left by the sources.

For the thematic essay questions practise answering three types: similarity/difference across time, the process of change (causes and continuity), and evaluative judgement questions that require you to balance factors. Start essays with a short introduction setting out the time span and your approach. Use clear topic paragraphs that each focus on one factor—such as economic, religious or institutional—and support points with specific examples and case studies from the specification. For evaluation questions explicitly compare the importance of different factors and end with a reasoned judgement that weighs the evidence. Remember to use precise historical vocabulary and to aim for clear chronological structure when comparing long periods.

Time management is essential. Allocate time for planning and a final check, and in longer answers use brief signposting sentences to guide the examiner through your argument. For higher marks, show causal chains rather than lists of factors: explain how institutions influenced attitudes, which in turn shaped laws and migrants’ experiences. When source or interpretation questions appear in other papers, always combine analysis of the given material with your own contextual knowledge to support and challenge the views presented. Practise writing full responses under timed conditions, and seek feedback to improve clarity, use of evidence and the quality of your judgements.
