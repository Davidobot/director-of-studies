# Weimar and Nazi Germany (1918–39) (GCSE History Pearson Edexcel)

## Introduction and overview
The period 1918–39 in Germany covers the collapse of imperial rule, the fragile democracy of the Weimar Republic, the shocks of economic crisis and political violence, and the rise of Adolf Hitler to create a one-party dictatorship that reshaped German society. This story is shaped by political failure and recovery in the 1920s, a catastrophic economic collapse at the end of the decade, skilful use of propaganda and organisation by the Nazis, and a combination of legal measures, terror and social policy to secure and extend Nazi control. To succeed in this topic you need to understand the causes and consequences of key events, compare interpretations, and use contemporary sources to support balanced judgements about why Germany moved from revolution to dictatorship.

## The Weimar Republic, 1918–29: collapse, crisis and recovery
Germany’s defeat in 1918 produced political upheaval: the Kaiser abdicated and a republic was declared amid strikes and mutinies. The Weimar Constitution created a democratic system with a president who had emergency powers, proportional representation in the Reichstag and a range of civil liberties. These features made the system modern but also vulnerable; proportional representation encouraged fragmented parliaments and weak coalition governments, and Article 48 allowed the president to rule by decree in emergencies.

The new republic faced immediate and sustained problems. Many Germans resented the armistice and the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed territorial losses, reparations and the “war guilt” clause; the myth of a “stab in the back” blamed democratic politicians for Germany’s defeat. Political violence came from both the left and the right. Left-wing revolts, most notably the Spartacist uprising, and right-wing attempts to overthrow the government, including the Kapp Putsch and the actions of the Freikorps, tested the Republic’s survival in its early years. The crisis of 1923 combined hyperinflation, caused partly by the economic effects of the war and reparations and by government finance decisions, with the French and Belgian occupation of the Ruhr when Germany defaulted on payments. Hyperinflation devastated middle-class savings and damaged confidence in the Republic.

From 1924 to 1929 the Republic experienced a period often called the “Golden Years.” Stabilisation under Gustav Stresemann, the introduction of the Rentenmark and the economic help organised through the Dawes and later the Young Plan made recovery possible, although it relied heavily on American loans and was therefore fragile. International acceptance followed diplomatic successes such as the Locarno Pact and Germany’s admission to the League of Nations. Socially and culturally the mid-to-late 1920s saw improvements in living standards, new freedoms for women and a flourishing of the arts and cinema, though not all Germans benefited equally and many conservatives felt alienated by cultural changes.

## Hitler’s rise to power, 1919–33: organisation, opportunity and elite politics
Hitler’s path from a defeated soldier to Führer combined long-term organisation with short-term opportunities. He joined the German Workers’ Party after the war, reshaped it into the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP), and outlined its platform in the Twenty-Five Point Programme. The party used a mixture of nationalist rhetoric, anti‑Semitism, promises to restore pride and economic stability, and paramilitary intimidation through the SA to build appeal. The Munich Putsch of 1923 was a failure that led to Hitler’s imprisonment, but his trial and the publication of Mein Kampf increased his national profile and gave him time to rethink strategy. After 1924 the Nazis focused on legal methods, reorganising the party and building mass support through propaganda, effective organisation in local branches, and targeting different social groups.

The Great Depression, beginning in 1929, was the critical turning point. The crash in the United States caused the withdrawal of loans and a collapse in German industrial production and employment. Support for moderate parties declined, while votes for extremes rose; the Communist and Nazi parties both gained as people sought radical solutions. The Nazi message of strong leadership, opposition to communism, promises to revive the economy and skilful use of mass rallies, posters and the radio helped them increase their share of the vote between 1929 and 1932. Yet electoral success did not automatically translate into power. By 1932 Hitler was the most visible leader of the largest single party, but he still lacked an outright majority.

Crucially, conservative elites and conservative politicians miscalculated. Figures such as former Chancellor von Papen and President Hindenburg believed they could control Hitler and use him to stabilise government while keeping him in check. Backroom negotiations, a fear of communist revolution among the elites, and underestimation of Hitler’s ambition culminated in his appointment as Chancellor in January 1933. The appointment was a turning point: it put Hitler at the head of a legal government from which he could consolidate authority.

## Nazi control and the establishment of dictatorship, 1933–39
Once in office Hitler moved rapidly to dismantle democratic structures and eliminate opposition. The Reichstag Fire in February 1933 was used as the pretext for the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended civil liberties and allowed detention without trial. The Enabling Act passed in March 1933 gave the cabinet power to make laws without parliamentary consent, effectively sidelining the Reichstag and making Hitler the legal dictator. The process of Gleichschaltung, or coordination, brought states, local government, trade unions and professional organisations under Nazi control. Political parties were banned, and the Social Democrats and Communists were crushed.

Violence and terror were central to Nazi rule. The SA initially played a significant role in intimidation and street violence, but when its leader Röhm threatened the Army and traditional elites, Hitler ordered the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, eliminating SA leadership and consolidating support from the military. President Hindenburg’s death shortly afterwards allowed Hitler to combine the offices of president and chancellor and demand the army’s oath of personal loyalty to him.

The regime built an extensive security apparatus. The Gestapo and the SS, under Himmler, enforced conformity through surveillance, arrests and the establishment of concentration camps as early as 1933. The legal system was subordinated to Nazi goals. Propaganda, managed by Joseph Goebbels’ Ministry of Propaganda, controlled newspapers, film, radio and culture, and staged spectacles such as the 1936 Berlin Olympics to project a modern, powerful image. Churches and other potential centres of independent authority were pressured and co-opted; the 1933 Concordat with the Catholic Church temporarily limited overt conflict while the regime established the pro-Nazi Reich Church to control Protestant institutions.

Opposition existed but was limited and dangerous. Religious leaders such as Pastor Martin Niemöller resisted, youth subcultures like the Swing Youth and the Edelweiss Pirates rejected Nazi conformity, and small left-wing and religious groups tried to resist. Repression and the risk of arrest or worse made open opposition costly, and many Germans conformed, sometimes out of conviction but often out of fear or pragmatism.

## Life in Nazi Germany, 1933–39: social and economic policy, and persecution
The Nazis tried to shape everyday life as well as politics. Policy towards women emphasised family and motherhood, with incentives such as marriage loans and honouring large families with the Mother’s Cross, while employment and legal measures encouraged women to leave paid work. Education and youth policy sought to mould the next generation; the Hitler Youth and League of German Maidens aimed to instil loyalty, physical fitness and Nazi ideology, while curriculum changes emphasised racial science, obedience and military preparedness.

Economically, the regime reduced mass unemployment through a mix of public works, such as the building of autobahns, rearmament, and schemes like the Reich Labour Service. Invisible unemployment—by removing women and Jews from employment figures—also made statistics look better. Organisations such as the German Labour Front replaced trade unions, while Strength Through Joy and Beauty of Labour offered leisure and workplace improvements to tie workers more closely to the state.

Persecution of minorities was central and escalatory. Racial ideology singled out Jews for exclusion and persecution. The 1933 boycott of Jewish businesses initiated a campaign that hardened with the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, which stripped Jews of citizenship and forbade marriage with “Aryans.” Violence escalated in the state-condoned pogrom of Kristallnacht in November 1938, when synagogues were burned, shops smashed and thousands of Jewish men arrested and sent to concentration camps. Other groups targeted included Roma and Sinti, homosexuals, and people with disabilities, the latter subject to the T4 euthanasia programme. These policies combined legal exclusion, economic pressure, terror and, by 1939, organised plans for exclusion and forced emigration that presaged the regime’s later genocidal policies.

## Using sources and interpretations: skills for Paper 3
Paper 3 tests not only knowledge but your ability to use contemporary sources and later interpretations to reach judgements. When you analyse a contemporary source, begin by asking who produced it, when and why, and what message it seeks to convey. Consider tone and audience: a government poster aims to persuade and will therefore exaggerate or omit inconvenient facts, while a private diary can offer honest feeling but is limited in scope. Use your contextual knowledge to check whether the source’s claims fit known events and to explain what it reveals and what it hides. For the question that asks about usefulness, combine the source analysis with specific knowledge to explain strengths (for example, a Reichstag speech by Hitler illustrates public rhetoric and official aims) and weaknesses (for example, it may conceal private intentions, or be designed for propaganda).

When comparing interpretations, first summarise each historian’s claim in your own words and then explain how they differ. Differences often arise because historians give weight to different types of evidence, write at different times, or have differing viewpoints. For example, one interpretation might stress Hitler’s manipulative genius and the Nazi party’s grassroots appeal, while another might emphasise the role of structural factors such as economic crisis and conservative elite deals. To evaluate interpretations you should explain why one interpretation is more convincing for certain aspects and use your own evidence to support or challenge both. Always use specific facts, names and dates to show understanding and to back up your judgement.

## Exam technique
Success in the exam depends on clear knowledge, analytical skills and good technique. For source questions spend time identifying provenance and purpose, then move to content and context; make three clear points about usefulness and back each with knowledge that either supports or challenges the source. For the compulsory AO3 inference question in Section A, extract clear inferences and explain how the source supports them, linking to the wider historical background. For the longer analytical essays, aim to plan a brief structure: a clear introduction that answers the question, a sequence of paragraphs each making a single point supported by specific evidence, and a conclusion that brings together the argument and makes a judgement. Use the stimulus points when provided but always add your own details.

Timing matters: in a 90-minute paper allocate time to Section A and B as the paper requires, and leave a few minutes at the end to check SPaG (spelling, punctuation, grammar) for the question where marks are available. When analysing interpretations in Section B, compare them directly and then explain reasons for differences, using context to highlight strengths and weaknesses. Always aim to balance description with analysis; examiners reward explanation of cause, consequence and significance, not just narrative. Finally, practise with past-style source extracts and interpretations, and get used to writing concise, evidence-rich paragraphs under timed conditions. Regular practice will build the confidence and clarity you need to show both knowledge and historical thinking on the exam paper.
