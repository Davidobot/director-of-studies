# Western Front 1914–18: injuries, treatment and trenches (GCSE History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: why the Western Front mattered for medicine and warfare
The Western Front was the main theatre of war in north‑eastern France and Flanders between 1914 and 1918. What made this front distinctive was its static, industrialised warfare: long lines of trenches, heavy artillery bombardments, barbed wire and repeated attacks across no‑man’s‑land. These conditions created new kinds of injury and produced enormous logistical and medical challenges. The scale and intensity of casualties forced armies to develop a system of frontline care and evacuation, to experiment with surgical and medical techniques, and to adapt civilian medical knowledge to the battlefield. Studying the British sector brings together the military, technological and human stories of how medicine changed under pressure and how ordinary soldiers coped with the daily reality of trench life.

## The trench system and the daily realities that shaped medical needs
Trenches were not single lines but a complex system of front‑line, support and reserve trenches linked by communication trenches and saps. Front‑line troops lived and fought from parapets, fire‑steps and dugouts, while behind them support and reserve lines provided rest, supplies and staging areas for counter‑attacks. The trench architecture—parados, traverse, duckboards, and deep dugouts—was shaped by the need for protection from shellfire and snipers, but it also trapped soldiers in damp, cold, and insanitary conditions. Waterlogged trenches, shell craters and frozen ground made movement and evacuation difficult. Rats, lice and the constant presence of decomposing bodies contributed to disease and low morale. The nature of this environment produced specific medical problems—trench foot, trench fever, respiratory illness from cold and damp, and infections from chronic wounds—that were as important as wounds caused directly by weapons.

## The kinds of wounds and illnesses encountered on the front
The most immediate causes of battlefield injury were artillery shells, rifle and machine‑gun fire, and shrapnel. Artillery produced the majority of casualties: blast, fragmentation and collapsing earth could cause severe limb wounds, head injuries, and internal trauma. Shrapnel and shell fragments often caused ragged, contaminated wounds that rapidly became infected. Rifles and machine‑guns produced penetrating wounds that could be clean but fatal if vital organs were struck. Poison gas, introduced in 1915, brought new and terrifying injuries: chlorine and phosgene gases caused choking and lung damage, while mustard gas blistered the skin and eyes and could cause long‑term respiratory illness. In the confined, wet conditions of the trenches, non‑combat illnesses were widespread. Trench foot—caused by prolonged exposure to cold and wet—could lead to gangrene and amputation if not treated. Lice transmitted trench fever, which could incapacitate men for weeks, and the risk of wound infection made even relatively minor injuries potentially life‑threatening before the age of antibiotics.

## Medical organisation and the chain of evacuation
To cope with the scale of casualties, the British Army developed a chain of evacuation designed to provide immediate first aid at the front and escalate care as wounded soldiers moved back from the line. Stretcher‑bearers and regimental aid posts provided initial treatment and stabilization. From there, wounded men were moved to field ambulances and dressing stations where surgical priorities were assessed. Casualty clearing stations (CCSs) were a step further back: semi‑permanent facilities with surgeons able to perform major amputations and life‑saving operations. From CCSs patients were sent to base hospitals in France or evacuated to hospitals in Britain. Transport itself evolved: horse and motor ambulances, pony carts, and where possible hospital trains were used, but shelling and broken ground frequently slowed or prevented movement. The Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) organised medical services and worked alongside nurses from the Queen Alexandra’s Imperial Military Nursing Service and Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADs). Medical personnel faced the practical problems of communication breakdowns, artillery bombardment and the need to treat large numbers of casualties under fire.

## Surgical and medical advances on the Western Front
The pressures of modern industrial warfare accelerated medical innovation. Surgeons refined techniques for dealing with contaminated wounds, moved towards debridement and delayed closure rather than immediate suturing, and experimented with antiseptic irrigation methods such as the Carrel–Dakin technique to reduce infection. The Thomas splint, an external splint for stabilising fractured femurs, dramatically reduced mortality from open thigh fractures by preventing shock and blood loss during transport; its widespread use is one of the clearest examples of lifesaving innovation. The availability of mobile x‑ray units improved surgeons’ ability to locate shell fragments and bullets; these units, developed in part through the efforts of pioneers who organised radiography close to the front, allowed safer and more precise surgery. Plastic and reconstructive surgery also emerged as a specialised field. Surgeons such as Harold Gillies developed techniques to repair devastating facial injuries, creating new approaches to skin grafting and staged reconstruction that had not existed before the war. Blood transfusion also took a major step forward: for the Battle of Cambrai and other operations, doctors began to store blood with anticoagulants and to organise depots, effectively creating early blood banks that made transfusions more available and helped reduce deaths from haemorrhage.

## The significance of medical developments and their limits
The advances made on the Western Front transformed survival rates and influenced civilian medicine after the war. Better evacuation, improved surgical technique, mobile x‑ray use, stabilising splints and organised blood supplies all combined to increase the proportion of wounded men who survived their initial injuries. The war also highlighted the value of trained nurses and organised medical services, and many wartime techniques—such as organized triage and antiseptic irrigation—entered peacetime practice. However, limits remained. There were no antibiotics to treat deep infections like gas gangrene or septic wounds; recovery could be long and incomplete, and many soldiers were left with lifelong disability or facial disfigurement. The psychological effects of prolonged frontline service—then called shell shock—were poorly understood and often stigmatized, although by 1918 the army had begun to develop treatments and practices to address trauma more systematically. The scale of suffering and the need for reconstruction after the war pushed medical research and social policy into new directions during the interwar years.

## Studying the British sector: sources and enquiry approaches
When studying medicine on the Western Front you use a mix of national and local sources. Official army records, RAMC reports, medical journals of the period, government inquiries and hospital statistics provide a formal, often administrative view of how medical services were organised and what was attempted. Personal diaries, letters, nurses’ accounts, memoirs of surgeons, photographs, and hospital case records offer vivid detail about daily life, the experience of injury and the realities of treatment. Local sources, such as regimental histories or accounts of particular hospitals—like the underground hospital at Arras—can illuminate the role of specific sites and units. Each source has strengths and weaknesses: official records may underplay failures or sanitise problems; personal accounts can be subjective or limited by the author’s perspective; photographic evidence may be staged or partial. A useful enquiry might ask how well the chain of evacuation worked during a particular offensive, or how surgical techniques developed between 1914 and 1918. In answering such questions, compare different kinds of evidence, assess their usefulness for the enquiry, and use contextual knowledge—about the nature of trench warfare, medical technology of the early twentieth century, and army logistics—to support your judgement.

## Teaching examples and useful case studies
A number of case studies help students connect the broad themes to concrete events. The underground hospital at Arras illustrates how medical facilities adapted to the threat of bombardment and how subterranean spaces were used for surgery and recovery. The Battle of Cambrai can be used to examine the organisation of blood supplies and the practicalities of transfusion and casualty management under novel operational conditions. The widespread adoption of the Thomas splint following early battles where its absence led to higher fatality rates is a powerful example of how a single practical change saved many lives. Studying the work of surgeons such as Harold Gillies shows how the need to treat specific types of injury—severe facial trauma from shrapnel and shell—drove the creation of entirely new surgical disciplines. Linking these medical stories to soldiers’ letters and nurses’ diaries helps students grasp both the technical and human dimensions of wartime medicine.

## Exam technique
Answering Paper 1 historic environment and thematic questions on the Western Front requires both precise factual knowledge and clear use of sources. For the historic environment section, expect questions that ask you to describe features—such as the organisation of trenches or stages of the chain of evacuation—and to analyse two contemporary sources for usefulness. When describing features, be specific and use terminology from the topic (e.g. dressing station, casualty clearing station, Thomas splint). When assessing source usefulness, consider origin, purpose, content and context: who produced the source, why, and what does it tell you about medical practice? Balance the source evidence against your own knowledge and suggest a sensible follow‑up enquiry that could be answered by further evidence. For the thematic study essays, practise structuring answers that address the question directly, develop an argument with several linked paragraphs, and use relevant examples across the period 1914–18. For similarity/difference and change questions, make comparisons across time or between situations (for example, compare treatment in 1914 with 1918, or compare aid under heavy shelling with quieter periods). For longer judgement essays, plan a clear introduction that sets out the criteria for your judgement, use specific evidence (techniques, people, sites) to support balanced analysis, and end with a concise conclusion that answers the question. Remember to use specialist terminology accurately and, where relevant, include a short evaluation of sources or interpretations to show AO3/AO4 skills. Finally, practise timed responses, ensure legibility and relevance, and aim to link every point back to the question so your answer stays focused and convincing.
