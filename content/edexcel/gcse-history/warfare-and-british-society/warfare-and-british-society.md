# Warfare and British society (c1250–present) (GCSE History Pearson Edexcel)

## Understanding the theme: warfare and change
Warfare has been one of the most powerful forces shaping British society from the medieval period to the present day. To understand this theme you should think about how governments and individuals, advances in science and technology, and changing attitudes in society combined to change the way wars were fought and the effects those wars had at home. Across the centuries warfare affected who served in armies and why, the weapons and organisation used on the battlefield, the scale of violence, and the ways civilians experienced conflict. The thematic study expects you to trace continuities as well as change: for example, soldiers’ courage and fear remained constants, but the tools, scale and social consequences of fighting altered dramatically. Case studies — battles, reforms and conflicts — are essential: they give you detailed evidence to explain broader trends and to use in exam answers.

## c1250–c1500: medieval warfare and English society
Medieval warfare was rooted in the social structure of feudal society. Armies were a mixture of mounted knights, who owed military service to their lords, local levies and increasingly skilled longbowmen. The longbow in particular transformed English tactics: at battles such as Falkirk (1298) and Agincourt (1415) disciplined English archers could break the charges of heavier cavalry and play a decisive role in victory. New formations and the introduction of infantry tactics began to reduce the dominance of the mounted knight, altering the social prestige that had attached to chivalry.

Recruitment and training reflected social obligations. Nobles and knights trained for mounted combat, while peasants might be called up for local defence or provide logistical support. Civilians experienced war directly. Armies on campaign lived off the land, and ‘foraging’ or plunder could devastate communities. The Crown’s need for money to pay for military expeditions also shaped government finances and taxation, while military technology such as early gunpowder weapons began to appear late in the period, hinting at profound changes ahead.

The case studies of Falkirk and Agincourt allow you to link technology, leadership and social organisation to outcomes. Falkirk showed weaknesses in Scottish schiltrons when facing English cavalry and archers, while Agincourt highlighted Henry V’s use of terrain, archers and morale against superior numbers. Use these battles to explain how strategy, leadership and technology combined to produce victory or defeat.

## c1500–c1700: early modern warfare and the rise of professional armies
The early modern period saw a move from feudal armies to more professional, disciplined forces. New weaponry — muskets, pikes and early artillery — changed tactics and required different training and organisation. The English Civil Wars of the 1640s illustrate this shift. The New Model Army, organised, trained and paid centrally, was a turning point: it established the idea of a standing, professional force whose effectiveness depended on recruitment, discipline and logistical support.

War began to affect civilians and politics in new ways. Requisitioning of supplies, forced billeting and taxation provoked grievances; religious and political conflicts threatened the authority of the Crown and could lead to civil war. The Battle of Naseby (1645) is a vital case study: it demonstrates how organisation, discipline and strategic skill (notably Cromwell’s cavalry) could defeat a royalist army and change the course of a nation’s politics. You should be ready to explain how the New Model Army reflected broader social and political changes, including the growing role of Parliament and the changing relationship between ruler and ruled.

## c1700–c1900: industrialisation, imperial warfare and mass armies
The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries brought industrialisation and with it major changes in the nature of warfare. Improvements in firearms, the development of rifled barrels and more effective artillery increased range, lethality and the importance of logistics. Steam-powered transport and the expanding railway network revolutionised the movement of troops and supplies. Industrial manufacture made weapons easier to produce in quantity, supporting the rise of mass mobilisation.

Recruitment and training professionalised further through reforms such as those introduced by Cardwell in the 1870s, which reorganised the British army, improved conditions for soldiers and linked regiments to local areas. The growth of the press and photography meant that wars such as the Crimean War and the Boer War were reported at home with greater immediacy, influencing public opinion and political pressure for reform.

Waterloo (1815) and Balaclava (1854) are useful case studies. Waterloo shows the impact of command, coalition warfare and tactical deployment under Wellington against Napoleon. Balaclava, especially the Charge of the Light Brigade and the conditions of the Siege of Sevastopol, highlights logistical problems, the human cost of obsolete tactics against modern firepower, and the role of the media in shaping public perceptions of war and leadership.

## c1900–present: total war, technology and the changing home front
The twentieth century introduced total war and rapid technological change. The First World War transformed both battlefield and society. Trench warfare, machine guns, artillery barrages, gas, tanks and aircraft produced industrial-scale slaughter and required unprecedented logistical support. Conscription and national mobilisation meant that entire societies became part of the war effort. The Western Front, and the Battle of the Somme (1916) in particular, exemplify trench warfare, the strategy of attrition, and the social cost of large-scale offensives. The Somme is a key case study for explaining how technology, command decisions and morale shaped outcomes and social memory.

Medicine and casualty care also advanced during the First World War. Innovations such as the Thomas splint, mobile x-ray units and organised chains of evacuation improved survival rates; these developments had a lasting impact on military and civilian medicine. The experience of Conscientious Objectors during the world wars also tests societal attitudes to duty, dissent and state power.

The Second World War expanded the concept of total war with strategic bombing, aerial warfare and home front mobilisation. Post-1945 developments brought nuclear weapons, Cold War deterrence, decolonisation conflicts and new forms of asymmetric and guerrilla warfare. The Iraq War (2003) is a modern case study showing the use of high-tech surveillance, precision weapons and a small professional force against irregular resistance; it invites discussion about the limits of technology when faced with political complexity and counterinsurgency challenges.

Throughout the modern era the composition of the army changed to include logistics corps, specialists such as bomb disposal and signals units, and expanded roles for women in support and, later, front-line positions. Public attitudes to casualty reporting, censorship and propaganda shifted as mass media and then television brought the realities of conflict into people’s living rooms. These changes influenced recruitment, morale and policy.

## London and the Second World War, 1939–45: the historic environment
Studying London during the Second World War allows you to explore how warfare shaped a city and how civilians coped with sustained attack. London’s importance as a capital, port and industrial centre made it a strategic target. Preparations from 1939 included evacuation plans, distribution of Anderson shelters and gas masks, and civil defence organisation. Evacuation had major social consequences as children and families were uprooted and dispersed across the countryside.

The Blitz (1940–41) and later V1 and V2 attacks brought widespread devastation. The intensity of bombing raids such as Black Saturday (7 September 1940) and the V2 assault on Deptford (1944) caused loss of life, destruction of homes and damage to industry. Responses included widespread use of underground stations as shelters, community initiatives to clear rubble, and maintenance of essential services. The impact on daily life was profound: rationing, blackout regulations, and the strain on housing and public morale shaped Londoners’ wartime experience.

Government action to sustain morale is central to this study. Propaganda, censorship and high-profile examples such as the continued public appearances of the Royal Family and ministers helped project resilience. Initiatives like ‘Dig for Victory’ and the use of public space for allotments or salvage demonstrated collective effort. Events such as the Bethnal Green disaster (1943) and the South Hallsville School bombing (1940) reveal the human cost and the complex interplay between civil defence, overcrowding and municipal responsibility.

As a historic environment this topic also requires work with sources. You should be comfortable using local records (council minutes, housing records), personal accounts (diaries, letters, oral histories), newspapers, Mass Observation reports, newsreels and photographs. Know how to evaluate their usefulness: personal accounts give vivid detail but are subjective; newspapers reflect public information and censorship; official records can show policy but may downplay failures. Be ready to frame enquiry questions, select appropriate evidence and use sources to support a balanced judgement about life in wartime London.

## Using evidence: sources and interpretations
Across the whole thematic study you will be asked to use contemporary sources and to evaluate later interpretations. Contemporary sources include official documents, diaries, newspapers, photographs, maps and artefacts. When assessing usefulness think about what the source actually shows (content), who produced it and why (provenance and purpose), and what it leaves out. For example, a soldier’s letter home may tell you about everyday conditions and morale but will rarely give an accurate picture of strategic rationale. Official statistics on recruitment or casualties are valuable for trends but need checking for context and possible propaganda uses.

Later interpretations reflect historians’ judgements and the evidence available to them. Interpretations differ because historians emphasise different factors (technology, leadership, social change), use different sources, or write from different perspectives. In essays you should show that you can contrast interpretations and explain why differences arise, using your own knowledge to evaluate which explanation is more convincing.

Always anchor your use of evidence in the case studies set out by the specification. For Warfare and British society, detailed knowledge of Falkirk, Agincourt, Naseby, Waterloo, Balaclava, the Somme and Iraq (2003), along with understanding of patterns across the centuries, will let you move from specific evidence to broader arguments.

## Exam technique
Answering the questions in Paper 1 requires clear focus on the assessment objectives. For the historic environment section, Question 1 typically asks you to describe features: use concise, factual sentences with specific examples, dates and statistics where appropriate. For the two-source Question 2 (usefulness) start by briefly summarising what each source says, then analyse provenance (who produced it, when, and why), content (what it reveals) and limitations. End with a judgement weighing strengths and weaknesses and suggesting a sensible follow-up enquiry that uses another type of source.

For the thematic questions, Question 3 asks about similarity and difference over time. Structure your answer by identifying clear points of similarity and clear points of difference, using at least two periods as comparisons and supporting each point with case-study evidence. Question 4 focuses on the process of change: explain the pattern of change (rapid, gradual, or uneven), give causes and link them to the three key factors (government/individuals; science/technology/communications; societal attitudes), and use examples from different centuries to show continuity and turning points. For the extended judgement Question 5/6 plan a short introduction that defines the focus of the question, a balanced middle section that weighs different factors or perspectives with specific examples, and a conclusion that makes a clear, supported judgement. Use the stimulus points if provided, but always add your own knowledge: examiners look for points beyond the prompts.

Time management matters. Spend the correct proportion of the 1 hour 20 minutes on the historic environment and the thematic study, leaving time to proofread. For extended writing, aim to build paragraphs around a single idea or factor, back each idea with evidence, and avoid generalised statements without support. Use historical terms accurately and, when appropriate, include short contextual dates (for example, “Naseby, 1645” or “Somme, 1916”) to anchor claims. Remember that SPaG is assessed in longer answers, so write clearly and check spelling, punctuation and sentence structure.

Finally, practise by writing timed answers that use the case studies in the specification. Learn the key facts of each case study, but also practise linking them to wider themes: technology, recruitment, social impact and government policy. This combination of precise knowledge, source awareness and clear explanation will enable you to meet the Paper 1 requirements confidently.
