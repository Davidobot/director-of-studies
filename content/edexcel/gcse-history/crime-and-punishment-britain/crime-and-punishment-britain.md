# Crime and punishment in Britain (c1000–present) (GCSE History Pearson Edexcel)

## The big picture: process of change
Studying crime and punishment over the last thousand years is about understanding how societies define wrongdoing, how they enforce the law and how ideas about justice change. Across the periods you are asked to cover, three broad factors repeatedly shape developments: changing social attitudes, the actions of individuals and institutions (particularly the Church and the state), and advances in science and technology. These factors interact. For example, public attitudes about the purpose of punishment shift from retribution and deterrence towards reform and rehabilitation, and those shifts are expressed in changing laws, in new institutions such as prisons and police forces, and in the introduction of forensic techniques that transform investigations. When you revise, think in terms of patterns of continuity and change, turning points where things accelerate or reverse, and reasons for those changes — who promoted them, who resisted them, and why.

## Medieval England c1000–c1500
In medieval England the boundaries between crime, sin and social disorder were fluid. Crimes could be committed against the person, property or authority. Poaching, for example, was both an economic survival strategy and a crime against landowners; the Norman Forest Laws turned traditional rights into criminal offences. Law enforcement relied heavily on local communities and customary procedures. Systems such as tithings, the hue and cry and the parish constable depended on communities to raise the alarm and pursue suspects. The legal response emphasised deterrence and retribution; punishments ranged from fines and corporal punishment to execution. Compensation systems such as the Anglo-Saxon were gradually replaced as royal courts and fines became more central.

Religion and the Church played a major role. Sanctuary — sheltering accused people in a church — and Benefit of Clergy, which allowed literate clerics to avoid secular courts, show how ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions overlapped. Trial by ordeal, grounded in a belief that God would reveal guilt, lasted until the early thirteenth century; its ending was a key turning point that opened the way for more rational legal procedures. The Black Death and social upheavals also affected crime, with labour shortages, social mobility and unrest changing patterns of theft, vagrancy and violence.

## Early modern England c1500–c1700
The early modern period saw both continuity and striking new definitions of crime. Theft and violent crime remained important, but the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries added offences such as heresy, treason, witchcraft and vagabondage to the list of socially and politically charged crimes. The state used law to enforce religious conformity and royal authority; prosecutions for heresy and treason were often political as well as judicial.

Law enforcement remained a mix of local and emerging state institutions. Town watchmen and parish officials carried out everyday policing, while the early roots of professional justice and administration grew stronger. The period also saw the beginnings of large-scale punishments such as transportation to colonies, which introduced an overseas element to the penal system. The so-called “Bloody Code” began to develop, increasing the number of capital offences and reflecting a belief in harsh penalties as deterrence.

Case studies bring these themes to life. The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 demonstrates how the state treated political conspiracy and the use of exemplary punishment to deter treason. The witch-hunts of 1645–47, associated with figures such as Matthew Hopkins, reveal how social anxiety, local disputes and shifting religious beliefs could produce outbreaks of prosecutions and executions; they also show the limits of the legal system and the role of popular belief in shaping prosecutions.

## Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries c1700–c1900
The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries witnessed major shifts in how crime was defined and how the state responded. While crimes such as highway robbery and smuggling persisted, attitudes towards punishment began to change. The Bloody Code reached its high point early in the eighteenth century with hundreds of capital offences, but by the nineteenth century public executions had become controversial and were gradually ended. Transportation to penal colonies became a key punitive measure until its decline in the mid-nineteenth century. Prison reform became a major theme, as figures such as John Howard and Elizabeth Fry campaigned for better conditions, sanitation and a focus on rehabilitation. The construction of model prisons such as Pentonville illustrates debates about the “separate” system: isolation was intended to encourage reflection and reform but often produced psychological harm, showing the complexity of reform efforts.

Policing also transformed. The shortcomings of local, ad hoc law enforcement led to the creation of more organised forces. Robert Peel’s establishment of the Metropolitan Police in 1829 created the first modern, centrally organised police force, with emphasis on prevention, uniformed patrols and a professional ethos. Detectives and the first Criminal Investigation Department developed later in the century, alongside improvements in investigative techniques such as photography and fingerprint collection in their earliest forms. Social and political unrest, whether connected to trade unions, the Tolpuddle Martyrs or radical movements, tested authorities and helped to shape legislation and policing priorities.

## Modern Britain c1900–present
The twentieth and twenty-first centuries continued the trend away from harsh corporal punishments towards a more varied penal system and greater use of science in detection. New crimes emerged as society and technology changed: driving offences, drug offences and racially motivated crimes required new laws and policing responses. The development of forensics accelerated: fingerprinting became a standard identification method in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, blood analysis and later DNA revolutionised investigations in the late twentieth century, and digital forensics now affects many modern inquiries.

Policing professionalised and specialised further, with the growth of criminal investigation departments, forensic units and preventative initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch. The abolition of the death penalty for murder in 1965 was a landmark, influenced by controversial cases such as Derek Bentley in 1953, whose trial and execution provoked national debate and contributed to the campaign against capital punishment. Prisons continued to evolve, with the development of open prisons, specialised facilities for young offenders and a greater interest in non-custodial sentences, though debates about prison overcrowding and rehabilitation remain central.

The experience of the world wars also affected attitudes to crime and punishment. Conscientious objectors during the First and Second World Wars faced tribunals, imprisonment or alternative service; their treatment highlights tensions between individual conscience and state needs in wartime. Throughout the modern period, changing public attitudes, legislative reform and technological advancement have combined to reshape definitions of crime and the mechanisms of justice.

## Whitechapel, c1870–c1900: the historic environment
Whitechapel is the specification’s chosen historic environment because it vividly illustrates the links between urban poverty, migration, crime and policing in the late nineteenth century. By the 1870s Whitechapel had become a densely populated inner-city area with overcrowded housing, lodging houses and poor sanitation. Philanthropic housing such as the Peabody Estates sought to improve conditions, while workhouses and poor relief addressed, inadequately, the needs of the poorest. Waves of migration — including Irish migrants earlier in the century and increasing numbers of Jewish migrants fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe during the 1880s — created a mixed, mobile and often precarious population. These demographic changes, together with poverty and the proliferation of public houses and lodging houses, contributed to social problems that the press linked to crime.

Policing the area presented practical difficulties. The Metropolitan Police’s uniformed beat constables were expected to be visible deterrents, but policing the labyrinth of alleys, courts and rookeries was extremely challenging. H Division, the local unit, worked with Scotland Yard detectives and the newly developing CID, yet coordination between the Metropolitan Police, the City of London Police and Scotland Yard was sometimes problematic. Investigative methods were improving: detectives used sketches, early photography and interviews to build cases, but communication, crowd control and forensic limitations hampered investigations.

The Jack the Ripper murders of 1888 are the most famous case associated with Whitechapel and demonstrate many of these tensions. Media sensationalism intensified public panic and sometimes interfered with police work. Local community responses included the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, reflecting both distrust of the police and civic initiative. Sir Charles Warren’s role and public attitudes to policing show the political dimensions of law enforcement. Whitechapel therefore offers a compact case study to explore the relationship between environment, social conditions, migration, policing and the limits and possibilities of late-Victorian crime control.

## Using sources and key evidence
A strong revision approach treats the topic both thematically and through evidence. For the thematic study, use named examples across periods to support general points: Forest Laws and tithings for medieval enforcement, Benefit of Clergy and Sanctuary for Church influence, Matthew Hopkins and the witch trials for early modern social panic, Robert Peel and the Metropolitan Police for nineteenth-century policing reform, John Howard and Elizabeth Fry for prison reform, and the Derek Bentley case and the abolition of the death penalty for twentieth-century change. For the Whitechapel environment, primary sources include Charles Booth’s survey of London poverty, local and national newspaper reports of crime and inquests, police records, coroners’ reports and photographs; secondary sources include historians’ interpretations of policing and urban social history.

When you evaluate contemporary sources, always consider what the source says (content), who produced it and why (provenance and purpose), and how that affects its usefulness for answering a specific enquiry. Newspapers may give vivid detail and public reaction but are influenced by sensationalism and political bias. Police reports can provide official procedures and statistics but will reflect institutional priorities. Combining different types of sources — local records, national reports and personal testimony — allows a more balanced picture and gives you grounds to reach substantiated judgements.

## Exam technique
Answering the exam requires clarity, evidence and second-order thinking. For questions asking about similarity and difference, identify the features being compared, explain both similarities and differences and support your points with precise examples across the required timespan. For change-and-continuity questions, place the development in chronological order, identify key turning points and explain causes and consequences, using named individuals, laws and institutions to show reasons for change. When a question asks for causation, organise your answer by factors (for example, social attitudes, individuals and institutions, science and technology), explain how they worked together and show which was most important with evidence.

For the historic environment source question, begin by summarising what each source claims, then assess usefulness by considering content, provenance and purpose, and conclude by referring to your own knowledge to confirm or challenge the sources. For the interpretation tasks in Paper 3, explain the difference between interpretations by reference to emphasis, evidence and viewpoint, and then evaluate one interpretation by supporting it with evidence and testing it against alternative explanations.

For extended writing, plan a short introduction that sets out your argument, develop balanced paragraphs that each make a clear point supported by evidence, and end with a conclusion that reaches a judgement. Use key terms (for example, deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation, transport, separate system, forensic evidence) and name people, laws and dates where relevant. Leave time to check spelling, punctuation and grammar; a clear expression and accurate use of specialist terms can earn additional SPaG marks. Practice writing timed answers which use specific examples from at least two periods, and learn to select the most relevant facts rather than trying to include everything you know.
