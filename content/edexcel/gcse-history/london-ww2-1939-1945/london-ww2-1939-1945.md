# London and the Second World War (1939–45) (GCSE History Pearson Edexcel)

## Overview: why London mattered and why it was targeted
London was Britain’s political, economic and symbolic heart in 1939. It housed central government, the financial City, major docks and factories and a dense population that supplied workers for war production. These features made London a prime military and propaganda target for the German Luftwaffe. From the autumn of 1940 the capital experienced sustained bombing campaigns designed to weaken British resistance, damage industry and undermine morale. For historians, London during the Second World War is both a story of destruction and of civic resilience; it is a rich historic environment for enquiries that combine evidence about government policy, civil defence measures, everyday life and the ways people reacted under sustained aerial attack.

## Preparing for war: evacuation, shelters and civil defence
In 1939 the government and local authorities introduced large-scale precautions to protect the capital’s population and maintain essential services. Evacuation of schoolchildren and vulnerable people to the countryside was organised in September 1939, and many London families experienced prolonged separations as a result. At home, millions of households were issued with gas masks and many dug or bought Anderson shelters for their gardens. The blackout and strict air-raid precautions altered daily rhythms as shops, factories and offices learned to function with reduced lighting and blackout curtains. A wide network of civil defence volunteers and professionals — Air Raid Precaution (ARP) wardens, rescue and fire services, ambulance crews and auxiliary first-aid teams — prepared to respond to raids, supported by essential communications and reporting systems. These measures reflected official attempts to protect civilians and maintain morale, while also revealing limits of planning when bombing began in earnest.

## The Blitz and later attacks: scale, methods and targets
The Blitz is often used to describe the intensive German bombing of British cities between September 1940 and May 1941, though attacks on London continued in other forms until 1945. The great night raid of 7 September 1940, often called “Black Saturday” in wartime reporting, signalled the start of prolonged attacks on the docks and industries of the East End. The Luftwaffe used high-explosive bombs and large numbers of incendiary devices designed to start fires that could spread through the tightly packed housing of dockside and inner-city areas. In 1944 the nature of the threat changed as Germany launched the V1 flying bombs in the summer and then V2 rockets from late 1944; these weapons were harder to predict and counter, producing sudden devastation in different parts of the city, such as the V2 strike on Deptford in 1944. The scaling and variety of bombs, the logistics of fires and rubble, and the repeated targeting of industrial and dockland infrastructure had long-term effects on the urban landscape and the organisation of wartime production.

## The human impact: sheltering, disruption and tragedy
Air raids changed the way Londoners lived. Many nightly commuters chose to sleep in shelters or in underground stations rather than risk their homes. Large-scale use of the tube system as improvised air-raid shelters created communal spaces that blurred the boundaries between private and public life. In some neighbourhoods, people used so-called ‘Mickey’s shelters’ and other makeshift refuges. The pressure of crowds and the fear of sudden explosions sometimes produced tragic consequences: local disasters such as the South Hallsville School incident in 1940 and the Bethnal Green tube-station crush in 1943 revealed the dangers people faced even when seeking safety. At the same time, many aspects of daily life continued: theatres, dance halls and other entertainments often stayed open, and workplaces adapted to new timetables. Food and fuel shortages, rationing and damage to housing caused hardship, but also encouraged mutual aid and improvisation at neighbourhood level. The experience of evacuation, the disruption of family life, the loss and injury suffered by civilians, and the shifting patterns of employment are all central to understanding London’s wartime society.

## London’s response: government, propaganda and community action
London’s response combined official direction and spontaneous community activity. The Cabinet War Rooms and the visible presence of senior ministers and the Royal Family in the capital were important symbols that the government would not be displaced. Propaganda and censorship were used to control information about casualties and damage and to present a narrative of stoicism and defiance; newspapers, newsreels and radio were carefully managed to preserve morale. Local initiatives—air-raid wardens, voluntary rescue squads, neighbourhood canteens and communal gardening drives under the ‘Dig for Victory’ campaign—were essential in maintaining daily life and food supplies. Public spaces, parks and even the Tower of London moat were repurposed for growing food or for civil defence needs. The combined effect of these activities was to sustain London as an operational centre and as a symbol for the wider British war effort, but historians must weigh official narratives of unity against evidence of strain, class differences in experience and the uneven distribution of aid.

## Sources and how to use them for enquiries
The historic environment of London 1939–45 offers a wide range of sources for enquiry, and doing good history means recognising the strengths and weaknesses of each type. Personal accounts and oral histories give vivid testimony about what it felt like to be evacuated, to sleep in a tube station, or to dig for victory; they are indispensable for understanding experience, but they can be selective, shaped by memory and by the circumstances in which they were recorded. Local newspapers, council minutes and housing records are valuable for tracing official decisions and local conditions such as overcrowding and damage, yet they often reflect institutional priorities and may omit informal activity. National government records, Mass Observation reports and newsreels reveal official policies and attempts to influence morale; these are useful for understanding propaganda, but they require careful reading for bias and omission. Photographs and aerial reconnaissance show the scale of physical destruction but rarely explain social consequences. When planning an enquiry, select a mix of sources to allow cross-checking: for example, compare Mass Observation findings on morale with local council reports on shelter provisions and with contemporaneous letters or diaries to build a fuller picture. Always ask what a source was produced for, who produced it, who it represents and what it might have left out.

## Making the historic environment work in the thematic study
Although the historic environment question focuses on London itself, exam answers gain strength when linked to broader themes from the Warfare and British Society thematic study. London’s experience illustrates wider concepts such as the impact of modern aerial warfare on civilians, the development of home-front organisation, the interaction between central government and local authorities, and how technology and communications (for example radar, air-raid alerts and the V-weapons) changed the conduct of war. Use London as an exemplar when answering thematic questions about change and continuity in wartime Britain: the Blitz shows how civilian lives were transformed, but the persistence of leisure and the functioning of the civil service show continuities in urban life and state operations. Drawing these connections demonstrates deeper understanding and is useful for longer analytical answers.

## Exam technique
For Paper 1 the London historic environment is assessed through two compulsory questions and is worth 16 marks. Question 1 typically asks you to describe features of the period and site (AO1), so write clear, focused paragraphs that identify features and explain their significance in the context of London’s wartime experience — for example, describe Anderson shelters and explain how they reflected government attempts to protect civilians. Question 2 is an AO3 two-part question based on two contemporary sources. Part (a) asks you to assess the usefulness of both sources for a specific enquiry. Start by briefly restating the enquiry, then analyse each source in turn: summarise its content, consider provenance (who produced it, when, and why), and explain what it can reveal and what it cannot. Use your contextual knowledge to back up or challenge the source’s claims, and compare the two sources: do they corroborate, contradict or provide complementary perspectives? Remember to discuss limitations — propaganda, partial viewpoints, or gaps in information — because acknowledging weaknesses shows critical judgement. For part (b) you will suggest a follow-up enquiry related to one of the sources; frame a focused research question (for example, “How effective were evacuation schemes in protecting children from bombing?”), outline the types of sources you would examine to answer it (local education and council records, personal evacuee accounts, school registers), and explain why those sources would be appropriate.

Time management is vital. Aim to spend about 20–25 minutes on the historic environment section: roughly 5–8 minutes on Question 1 (a and b combined) and 15–20 minutes on Question 2 (allowing time to analyse both sources and write the follow-up enquiry). In your AO3 answers use short, analytical paragraphs and ensure every point links back to the question. Practise writing concise provenance comments and pairing source analysis with at least one piece of outside knowledge to show how context helps evaluate usefulness. Finally, use precise historical terms and keep sentences focused: quality of argument and evidence will gain higher marks than long, general descriptions.
